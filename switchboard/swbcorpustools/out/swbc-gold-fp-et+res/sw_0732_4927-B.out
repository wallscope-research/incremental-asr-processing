 Okay 
 mandatory service Yeah I don't think it's a good idea 
 because we'd have to change the constitution to to allow involuntary servitude in service to the government 
 And I'm not sure that we could do that in such a way that we could avoid winding up a slave state
 It's 
 I like the idea
 Well I like the idea of volunteer voluntary support
 they might be able to say that anyone who does that gets certain benefits that would not be available to someone who didn't do it 
 But to use force really sets us a a i- i- essentially says that your body there's a title to your body and that title belongs to the government
 And you are not a free American citizen
 The idea itself of service is good 
 and when someone is say out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and they're not committed to huge amounts of debt that's the best time to be able to do work that doesn't pay very well
 Yeah 
 Unless it were tied directly
 You know if someone were studying something take something obscure Somebody was studying economics the State Department could offer to send them to the Soviet Union for two years to teach them how to run their country
 As an extreme example right
 But in reality I think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use to for their own will 
 and I just don't think it would work
 Well they're not 
 It's been suggested
 And it's sort of a topic of debate
 Every time it comes up it gets voted down 
 The people who are promilitary oppose because they don't want people to have the right to opt out of the military into something else
 And the people who are proconstitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless the United States is actually under attack 
 So mostly it's just kind of one of those things that goes away
 They've got a noisy line
 Yeah 
 Well it's somewhere between here and there
 eighteen 
 The draft age
 Yeah
 Wait a 
 yeah 
 Let me see if I can get on a cleaner line 
 If it's my line 
 Yeah 
 it is my line 
 I was on a radio phone
 All right 
 That's better 
 Yeah 
 now their 
 they they figure that they can draft you at eighteen 
 They usually do draft you at nineteen 
 And that's the age they're looking at
 And of course they're this one the women would be equally grabbed 
 and they're almost on the verge of saying that you if you're going to draft men you're going to have to draft women 
 And you're going to have to put them in front of the guns just the same
 So if you're near that age or you know somebody who is you know be aware of that
 Yeah 
 okay 
 Yep 
 And you don't want them sent off to the Middle East to help defend Bush from Saddam after Bush gets done arming him
 You know we only find out about that a year after the fact
 So it's another thing 
 When in doubt don't trust the government at all 
 It's really reached that point
 Hey you're in Perot country/
 I'm really thinking that this guy might be good for us
 I've been I- 
 it seemed dangerous 
 I thought is the guy a closet fascist 
 And then I find out that he helped rid the United States of the gablers
 Yeah
 Okay 
 Well I'm in the computer biz too 
 so I know he's well known in the industry
 They 
 I I have high hopes for him 
 And I think that you know if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the government was actually for us then I'm for him
 in the Democratic primary I'm going to vote for Brown just because I kind of like Brown and his attitude 
 But when when it really comes down in the fall I think I know where it's going to go
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 You know th- 
 Yeah 
 I'm an end user 
 I teach people how to use MacIntoshes and how to buy equipment and desktop publishing magazine production and things related to that
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 that's their project too isn't it/
 I found about it on the network
