 we've got quite a few actually 
 What we're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city
 we've actually had some warnings in Raleigh on air pollution
 Uh-huh 
 because of there so many cars 
 and we have a belt line alo- around Raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic
 And you know i- it's still it's just surrounding the city 
 and you can actually see it 
 There's a couple of tall buildings in Raleigh 
 and and you can actually you know 
 they're blurred 
 they're even dark 
 and what it is is the pollution
 Well I guess that's fluoro- the fluorocarbons 
 and 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that's very serious 
 we can we're even feeling the effects of the weather from the shift in the jet stream
 yeah 
 the last two years our winters have been absolutely nothing
 maybe one snow
 Kentucky
 North Carolina is all the way on the east coast
 It's further west than Georgia 
 it's right below Virginia
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Originally I'm from Texas 
 so Amarillo 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 real close
 I've been out of Texas about ten years
 twenty seven 
 I almost forgot my age
 really
 
 Uh-huh
 Actually they've been doing the same thing here 
 It's you know it's kind of funny 
 they I guess northerners are different 
 but even North Carolinians they don't know how to handle cold weather
 Uh-huh
 That's true
 Do you all have much pollution there
 Uh-huh
 Well you know what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road
 and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe
 Uh-huh
 Well 
 supposedly that's supposed to catch it 
 But I'll tell you what 
 and even these buses lord it real bad These buses in Raleigh
 yeah
 school buses are notorious
 yeah 
 yeah
 Well you know what they've started doing is is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top 
 and that way it gets above other cars on the road
 and it really does make a difference although it it settles you know 
 even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out it still settles 
 and and you know if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road that's that's even more miserable 
 I would I'd have to go out to the country to jog
 No 
 I didn't know that
 Uh-huh
 
 Uh-huh
 Golly that's that's bad
 I'm sure
 Well they you can really feel it you know in your breathing even normal people 
 and if you're older you can really deplete your oxygen 
 and it'll you know pass out
 and it's you know it's killed several people
 actually I'm a very I just smoke one in the evening if that 
 So I'm a very very light smoker
 It was kind of funny 
 They were doing some ozone testing and th- the E P A 
 and they were just screening some candidates 
 and I don't think I'd ever you know do that 
 but they asked me if I was a smoker 
 and I didn't fit into the smoker's category 
 and I didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category 
 it was you know I was just one of those 
 yeah 
 in between people 
 So that kind of threw them off
 But they're doing a lot of research here the E P A
 For ozone and yeah all that 
 They're they're real big into it 
 They've got Research Triangle Park here 
 and they're you know they're just doing a lot of lot of stuff
 Huh-uh
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 gosh I think I would hate to live in California the smog there
 I can't believe they have warnings here which it it's mainly just when it gets real real hot
 Really 
 W- well that's kind of good to know 
 because I thought lord I thought I lived in a halfway decent area
 
 Uh-huh
 Well you ought to come to North Carolina 
 It's a big change 
 Yeah
 There was no trees where I was from in Amarillo 
 and here they've got the mountains the beach the trees you know 
 it's they've got streams rivers ponds 
 it's really pretty here
 Is it
 Uh-huh
 Sherman and Denison 
 do you know my grandparents live in Durant
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 real close 
 I go there
 Yeah
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 we used to go fishing in Lake Texoma
 Huh- huh-uh 
 really
 Well I'm going to have to get some
 Uh-huh 
 Do you smoke
 Do you
 Did you smoke when you when you were pregnant
 Well 
 I can understand that actually
 Well 
 Yeah 
 Well one thing I miss is is the people from Texas are are you know 
 I miss their morals their values and everything 
 It's 
 Uh-huh 
 How'd you get involved in this research
 I see 
 
 I I was taking a voice I O class and and actually doing some research 
 and so they told me about this project
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 no 
 Boston's above
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I've talked to a lot of people in Texas 
 I had one call f- actually from Charlotte North Carolina and Virginia and 
 I can't remember where all 
 From up north like you said 
 I think one was from Boston
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I bet you're glad
 Uh-huh
 gosh
