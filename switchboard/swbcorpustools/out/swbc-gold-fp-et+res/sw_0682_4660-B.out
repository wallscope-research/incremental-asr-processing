 Generally I get most of my news from the radio 
 And then sometimes if I've got time I'll be reading the front page of the newspaper and just fall off on the articles that I like
 also since my wife likes to watch T V sometimes ju- having b- just being there I get you know I have to watch the news late at night with T V
 How about you
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 
 
 Okay 
 Do you get wh- like one of the talk stations the news stations 
 Sure 
 Right
 Sure
 Yes
 Okay 
 Right 
 S- it sounds like you like the news a lot more than I do 
 Me I figure if it's something really important somebody will tell me about it 
 But you know I the thing is if if I catch the news all the time it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news 
 Or that's what comes on first
 And you know also late at night you know I don't wa- like watching the news late at night 
 but my wife is usually up then 
 and so I can't go to sleep with the T V on
 I 
 but you know I I wish I had more news on things like that I consider long range Things like science and medicine
 I'm more I guess I'm more into science and science fiction 
 and there's you know 
 not that the news is science fiction 
 but I'm more interested in that 
 Things like is NASA ready for another space shot you know how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer
 and you know a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Me too 
 Yeah 
 Georgia here they're usually wrong too 
 We have weird weather systems
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'm you know I I just I would 
 I I I'm not a morning person 
 so I would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news 
 I get up just barely in time to get up get ready and get off to work 
 and then at work I have no time to read the news
 No <>
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Okay
 Nice talking to you 
 I'll probably talk to you again 
 I had a friend who was in this 
 and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes
 Yeah
 That's right
 Take it easy
 Bye-bye
