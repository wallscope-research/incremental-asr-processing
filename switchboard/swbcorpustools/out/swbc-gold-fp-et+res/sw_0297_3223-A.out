 Well I almost forgot the topic 
 I was waiting so long for for it to find somebody 
 Right 
 well so what is your favorite T V show
 you like that one
 Uh-huh 
 I've never really watched that one 
 You know it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows
 and you know there's so there's only a few that I that I like to watch routinely
 Probably my favorite is 
 well I like shows like GROWING PAINS 
 and what's the other one now they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night 
 so I don't get to watch it very much
 WONDER YEARS 
 yeah 
 that's my favorite 
 Yeah 
 WONDER YEARS 
 I I guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever 
 I guess I can really relate to it 
 and it's just a real cute show 
 I I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of I don't know honesty or sort of a purity value I guess
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 my wife really likes that show
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well there was 
 but there's a sense of ho- I guess purity in the show 
 like one of my favorite shows used to be HAPPY DAYS
 but you know Richie always used to be so you know just so honest and pure I guess 
 and when he left the show you know that it seemed to be missing that part of it
 and I never did like it after that
 so I don't know 
 I I say see the same thing in like WONDER YEARS and a lot of the shows that I like to watch 
 There always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So you're going to watch a game tonight
 So do you do you have a favorite for the series or anything
 uh-huh
 Yes
 Yeah 
 he's a nice guy
 I take it you live in the Dallas area
 Do you live in the Dallas area
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I live in Garland 
 and yeah 
 I I like Steve Bushel 
 but I don't really like the Pirates 
 I'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan
 so I'm kind of I'm kind of pulling for the Braves over all 
 they you know they they've come from so far down 
 I really would like to see them do well
 Yeah 
 one one year they 
 maybe they'll make it I don't know
 so but yeah 
 I like sports programming quite a bit 
 but I guess my my favorite shows are the 
 and you know that getting back to the point that you made that's really true 
 we were watching ROSEANNE I guess couple of weeks ago 
 and her daughter was talking about birth control you know
 and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time 
 and you know she's only seven years old 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 well that that seems to be more our values too 
 like the WONDER YEARS it's kind of risque stuff for maybe for teenagers 
 you know or and you can kind of relate to it you know 
 I don't know 
 that's 
 I enjoy that a lot
 but you know I agree with you 
 the 
 and it's funny because the shows 
 like a lot of them that used to be considered risque like THREE'S COMPANY and stuff I think they they maintained 
 people would watch them because 
 there was that you know there was really the period that was going on there 
 he really wasn't messing around with the girls 
 but everybody perceived him that way and stuff
 but as soon as you know he went to move in with another girl the show just died
 and it's it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way
