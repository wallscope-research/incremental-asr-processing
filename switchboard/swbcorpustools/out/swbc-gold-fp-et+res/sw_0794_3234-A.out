 Carolyn I have a little Schnauzer little miniature Schnauzer 
 What do you have
 You know those make the best animals pe- best pets 
 My son has a 
 it's a real mixture 
 it's part Doberman and part Husky 
 Yes 
 and they gentlest dog you ever met 
 and they got him from the Humane Society here in Oklahoma City
 and she's just turned out to be a jewel 
 My my little Schnauzer is is my friend 
 She is so spoiled 
 She's a year and a half old now 
 and being single she's become very important in my life
 it's so nice to have come home and find something or someone who's really so happy to see you
 Sometimes I wish I had not gotten this one it's a puppy because I work 
 and I'm not home
 and unfortunately she's not as well trained as as I would like her to be
 and I realize it's my fault 
 I'm not doing a really great job as a disciplinarian 
 but 
 It is 
 it is 
 She's you know she's real good 
 I can leave her all day in the bathroom with her toys and her food and everything 
 and and not one mess does she make
 and then we go outside 
 and she'll stay outside for thirty minutes to an hour come inside and use the restroom
 I just want to kill her at those times 
 But she's a doll 
 she's a love 
 she really is
 You know I I we always had a pet when I was growing up always had a dog 
 My mother did not like cats 
 So we always had a dog 
 and and then course when my children were growing up we always had a dog and always said it was because the children wanted the pet
 and I find that I'm enjoying this one far more than I ever did when it was the children's dog
 I in fact my children gave me this this little puppy for Christmas
 Yeah 
 I think so 
 my goodness
 Two babies 
 huh
 Oh
 That that is really probably bad timing
 yes
 Do you 
 and patience
 and you have to you really have to be just like your children 
 when you set a rule you have to stand by it and be consistent
 and
