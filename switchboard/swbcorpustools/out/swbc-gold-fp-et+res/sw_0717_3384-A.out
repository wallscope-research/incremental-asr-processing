 Okay 
 Do you work
 I think that's the main change 
 What do you think
 Right 
 That's right
 Well I've worked all the time up until just about a year ago
 And I just 
 physically I wasn't able to 
 and I love my job
 But I have four children 
 and that's real hard
 You have children 
 I assume so
 Right 
 Right 
 Right
 Oh
 Right 
 Oh 
 It's real hard
 It's real hard 
 even I 
 Yeah
 It was so hard for me to work full time
 Of course my kids are are a little older 
 but then you then you give up the money
 You know
 Yeah 
 Yep
 Fine 
 Yep 
 I know 
 Yeah
 Well I've decided now in fact I'm just I'm substitute teachers aid which is a afar cry from my travel agent career y- which I loved 
 But I'm I'm there in the same school as my children my two littler ones
 And I'm home when they are home 
 In fact I've had an offer to just work the Christmas season at a local jewelry store 
 and I'm just really hesitating because I've I enjoyed my the first summer home ever so like seventeen years with my kids
 well I didn't have babies or day care or working as a travel agent 
 and it was wonderful
 My kids and I we just had a ball
 Of course their their ages they are almost seventeen fif- almo- well sixteen fourteen eleven and nine 
 and we are just running every direction /
 and 
 It is
 It is 
 Always worked 
 What yeah 
 Right 
 Right 
 I think that you know it's good 
 You know sometimes I'll have the cookies ready when they come home 
 and and a lot of my boys my older boys' junior high friends will come over 
 In fact everyday I've got boys hanging around 
 and it's wonderful 
 I'm real close to the schools 
 and you know we are just 
 I I'm very happy to be staying home
 But again I miss the 
 I don't
 I keep on working 
 Right 
 That we are because it's so expensive 
 If we want extra clothes the extra car the extra 
 The thing is when a woman does work then there is the clothes to buy
 and then there is the gas
 and then there is the lunches and then the day care
 You must pay for 
 day care 
 Yeah
 my gosh
 Yeah 
 for two
 It's almost hardly worth it for you to work until they get in school
 Then you work summers unless you are a teacher
 Are you a teacher
 Uh-huh
 No 
 It's not the same
 I I don't see things changing really 
 and and it's terrible for divorced women you know who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college education 
 Thank goodness I have mine 
 and I could get a real good paying job if I wanted to you know d- in fact I still have offers you know please come back
 and we'll pay you this 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 And it's been a real tough decision 
 but I'm very happy to be here with my kids
 My kids we've seen a remarkable difference in now that I'm home
 Yeah 
 I'm real 
 and I'm 
 but I've been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I know 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 Well 
 that would be great 
 Right 
 I think the the other thing that that has changed for woman because we are working is we are having less children
