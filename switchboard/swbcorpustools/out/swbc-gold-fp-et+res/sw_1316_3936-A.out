 No 
 we haven't had any since uh oh just before Christmas 
 and uh we had a lot before Christmas 
 The ski resorts were really 
 and uh 
 but now we have we've had fog for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion 
 so 
 but no uh no snow
 The snows all melted off mount uh 
 Uh-huh 
 I guess there's different parts of the state of Utah that that does have some 
 but not 
 usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts 
 and they're down between thirty-eight and uh forty inches
 At this time of the year 
 and we've been in a drought for the last five years 
 and this is the sixth year 
 and it's getting quite serious as far as water next summer
 Right 
 Oh that's that's different isn't it
 Um
 I know my son was telling me about the rain down there 
 He said it was just 
 and we read in the newspaper southern part of Texas I guess flooded out 
 and uh 
 Oh boy
 Oh my gosh 
 Yeah my son in Plano he lives fairly close to 
 there's quite a wash that goes down uh through Plano
 and uh there's walking trails on both sides a walking path 
 and uh when I've gone down to visit him I've gone on that 
 but uh that was clear full and up to up to some of the streets I guess 
 It just k- 
 Uh-huh
 That's funny that uh we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much
 
 Yeah 
 well it's uh interesting 
 uh 
 I'm going down to El Paso next week 
 and uh I was wondering what the weather was 
 but I imagine if it's that cold in Dallas it 
 It's not a doesn't get that cold I guess huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 we're kind of used to that here in Utah 
 course there are mountains 
 and I fly into Montana a lot 
 and we have a 
 the mountains are are really uh high 
 and a lot of places we go in to you just kind of uh 
 it's in the little valley 
 but I uh sure hope we 
 we really need the moisture 
 I hope we can get uh get some
 There's supposed to be a storm 
 but it split went down through uh northern Arizona and southern Utah 
 and they're not predicting any for the next uh week anyway up here 
 so 
 Yeah 
 well that's that's what the 
 above uh 
 some of it went to the south and some to the north up into Montana 
 so that just left us 
 we got a high pressure system which has been sitting in the air 
 and uh we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had uh you know
 airport's been shut down uh till about noon every day 
 and then they seed the clouds or seed the fog to try to to get the airplanes in and out
