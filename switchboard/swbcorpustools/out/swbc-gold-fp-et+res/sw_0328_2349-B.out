 Okay
 I I understand that it's being proposed as a requirement for young people to be to go into public service 
 I think 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I think that it probably would be a a good program 
 I think probably two years is too long
 I think maybe a year would be the longest
 Yeah 
 and there will be a lot of rebellion in that 
 and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody
 Yeah 
 So I think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing to get out there and do so
 Yeah
 Right
 Right 
 College credit is a good idea because 
 Right
 That's right 
 Yeah 
 they probably couldn't do anything monetary 
 but I think giving giving some kind of college credit 
 No 
 I don't think so either because a lot of people depending on how the public service programs are set up 
 and I'm not that familiar with them to know
 But you know if a a lot of people flat can't afford to
 You know
 and most kids these days have gotten themselves into financial situations where they have to be working all the time
 So it's it's a really tough question
 That's right
 Yeah
 and if you put them in public service right out of high school then that that postpones their college for a year 
 and that would upset a lot of people too because they just want to get on 
 Yeah 
 I you know I think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program
 but I I think it can't be something that's mandatory
 it has to be something that's voluntary You know which is pretty much the way it is now 
 They might 
 Yeah 
 and that's the other thing is that you know instead of making it mandatory they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better and you know go to the schools and do programs and tell them that we need your help and you know volunteer for such and such a time
 and you've a choice of where you want to go
 and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it
 Yeah 
 in their own community 
 right
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 Most of them probably wouldn't do something like that Although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents 
 But they would have to be supported in some way 
 and I'm not sure that tho- those programs are available to do that
 Right
 Right 
 exactly
 Yeah 
 it is tough 
 It's 
 and I don't know who's even proposing it or or how they plan on implementing it if they do
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think going to the schools would be the easiest for them
 You know it be 
 it wouldn't take up much much it would take up more time than anything 
 but it wouldn't take up a lot of money
 They wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that
 You go to school 
 and you have a kind of a captive audience 
 get them all in the auditorium
 and you you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something
 and I think that they could get some results from that because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded 
 but they don't know where to go to to to do anything
 Yeah 
 it is 
 It really is
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 I don't either 
 That's one 
 Yeah 
 it is a tough question
 Sure 
 same here
 Ta- you too
 Bye
