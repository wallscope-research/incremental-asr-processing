 No 
 I haven't 
 Have you
 Uh-huh 
 it's not 
 the length isn't too long
 Uh-huh
 *[[slash error]] Well we all heard different opinions about it 
 
 Uh-huh 
 one that you know 
 yeah 
 it was too long 
 and they thought that you know at certain points that it was going to end 
 and it didn't 
 and it kept going on 
 and 
 uh-huh
 Really
 Now I've seen you know some different clips of it 
 and it it looks good 
 it's just I haven't had the time to go to the movies lately 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 oh 
 Hey 
 that'd work for me 
 let me tell you 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Now I've seen another clip of the guy that plays in MURPHY BROWN 
 I don't know his name 
 but he played the the the character in it that was very like gross very dirty 
 an- 
 I saw the one clip of him 
 and ugh 
 it was first 
 I guess he was taking Kevin Costner to like the site where he was going to be or whatever
 That was rather gross 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 But other than that I've heard the the you know the <> the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful
 Uh-huh 
 really
 really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 The styles 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well I guess I will have to see it then
 actually have been to the movies 
 I think the last movie I saw was MISERY
 very suspenseful
 I really don't either 
 but I went with someone 
 and once I was there I couldn't believe 
 it's an excellent movie
 Yeah
 It's not necessarily it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful 
 it's not
 No 
 in in the book apparently she cuts his feet off 
 but in the movie she she disables him but not by cutting his feet
 she she breaks both of his ankles
 And that I couldn't watch 
 and but you know you could tell when it was coming
 So yeah 
 that was so that he couldn't leave her 
 cause she 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 *[[need slash]] Yeah 
 *[[b]] well as far as that goes 
 yeah 
 you wouldn't like to see anybo- anything happen to anybody 
 but it was just how she got so caught up 
 her emotions 
 and you know and and she feel madly in love with this writer
 And there was this 
 but she was a killer 
 and the the character was you know prior to that had had been someone that had killed other people
 but no one knew that
 So But 
 So yeah 
 we just haven't had the time to go to the movies lately
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right 
 Now I want to see SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY
 *[[needs slash]] yeah 
 *[[aa]] that looks good 
 And there were a couple others that I just haven't had the time
 Now see I 
 Yeah 
 I don't think I want to see that either 
 I know 
 I don't think I could
 Really
 Really
 Uh-huh 
 I liked that movie
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh <> 
 Well I guess that's about it 
 It was nice 
 Okay

 Bye-bye
