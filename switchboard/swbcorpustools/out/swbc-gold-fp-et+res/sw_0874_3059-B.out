 Yes 
 I saw that one
 What was the second one
 I didn't see that one
 Did you see those because of Julia Roberts or for the subject matter of the two
 Uh-huh 
 Well I've 
 I saw SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY 
 and I I've seen well just recently WHAT ABOUT BOB
 Well that one is it's cute but kind of far out comedy Yeah 
 I am not one for the 
 I don't need the suspense movies or the the movies with lots of the horror movies with trying to shake you out of your chair
 I'm not sure 
 I I saw it and because my wife wanted to see it
 but on the other hand I'm not sure I would have gone otherwise 
 and having gone 
 well it really wasn't on a theme that I was that into 
 or as I say th- I prefer the light movies that 
 my style of entertainment is is comedy primarily and then into action films
 What
 Yeah 
 you kind of have to like to be drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen
 yes
 it was interesting 
 but I felt that one was a bit farfetched in that 
 well I'm trying to think of the other one I saw recently the one on DEFENDING YOUR LIFE
 Well that was one where 
 it's kind of like 
 to me it's somewhat like PRETTY WOMAN 
 The the story line 
 if you accept a few of the basic starting points I guess the rest falls in place 
 it was hard to accept that this multimillionaire wheeler dealer would would you know find himself and allow himself to get into that situation
 Yeah 
 It's sort of a modern CINDERELLA type of story
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 that was 
 I enjoyed that one 
 I in that I I guess I I hate to be too surprised in a movie 
 and in that one you could you could pretty well guess where it was going to end up 
 You weren't sure exactly how it would get there 
 but you knew where it would end up
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well whenever she starts crying 
 Well do you go to many movies more than once
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well these days it's 
 Well if you don't with some of the movies if you don't go to them within the first four weeks the movie may have left town never to show up again until it comes back in video
 So unless a movie is popular and stays around you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie
 So we have 
 well I think just most people have V C Rs now 
 and we probably watch twice as many movies at home as we do at movie theaters
 Did you go to DANCES WITH WOLVES
 I at least what I hear on that one that it's coming out a second time in a in a longer version even though it was a long movie 
 It's sort of the uncut version 
 At least that was some of the rumors 
 We'll have to see because it's there was some talk about that 
 I 
 maybe it will come out this fall 
 There 
 we're sort of in the middle of the summer season of a lot of new movies coming out 
 but then there's these periods like early fall before Christmas or early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again it will increase the revenues from the movie
 I I'd actually have to get a newspaper out 
 My approach to movies is I kind of hear about them 
 I keep track of them a little 
 but you know ask me to name the ten that are out there right now 
 and I'd have to say I I don't know 
 I I just look at the newspaper before I decide to go 
 and 
 it's kind of WHERE'S BOB or WHAT ABOUT BOB
 Yeah 
 Because some of them they they'll start in one area of the country 
 and if they it's
