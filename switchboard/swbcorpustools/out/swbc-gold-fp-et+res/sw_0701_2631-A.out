 Okay 
 I have two children 
 and they're older now 
 but I found it very difficult to find good child care when I was looking for a place to for stay while I thought school
 and I wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old I preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home 
 and that's what I looked for 
 and I was lucky enough to find one right across from my school 
 and that worked
 Yeah 
 that worked out real well 
 but when they got older I wanted them to be in a school type situation three I think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and and be around kids their own age because I think that's that that would prepare them for school also it's real important that they do that that they get that preparation for school
 so 
 but I had 
 I have switched schools several times because I di- I really didn't care for what was going on at that the school 
 I wanted them to learn to play I didn't academics forced on them at an early age
 Yeah 
 for the sch- for the kids 
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Oh 
 Wonderful 
 
 great
 
 Great 
 that's wonderful
 Yeah 
 That's wonderful 
 
 great
 Right 
 that's wonderful too
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 that's wonderful
 dear
 Sure 
 yeah
 you know that's an ideal situation
 but not many people can afford something like 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Sure 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Sure 
 I do to 
 yeah
 but they're they're are just so many people out there that aren't that lucky 
 because I'm a single parent
 and I you know my husband and I ex-husband and I got a divorce when the children were small 
 and so I was a teacher 
 I still am teacher
 and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was what I wanted where I could have piece of mind and when I taught school
 *[[ transcriber spelling error--"piece" should be "peace"]] and I knew my kids were being taken care of 
 Yeah 
 and plus I I wanted them to get something out of it I just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and that's it 
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Sure 
 Well 
 I agree with that 
 Well the thing is I teach this grade and I I can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other children 
 and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically because they were not they're should be there's to many things in their way
 *[[to should be too]] and so I want my 
 I wanted my children 
 and they did learn to get to get along with other people
 Yeah 
 and I feel a lot of maladjusted adults 
 and I bet if we trace back to their early childhood we could see some you know times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with people 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I bet you could too because it you know kids have to learn how to get along with other people
 and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really you know good adults or successful adults I should say
 you know really 
 but it is a big problem 
 and you kno- I have lot of friends right now that have young children 
 and they daily have problems with with whoever is taking care of the child
 or they switch a lot which is not good for the child either
 So you need 
 cause you need that consistency when they're young like that 
 and it would be ideal like you you hope when you have children your wife gets to stay home
 I would have have given anything if I would have been able to stay home with my children
 Yeah 
 you 
 Right
 great 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 that's wonderful
 great 
 You're very wise 
 Uh-huh 
 Sure 
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 don't they though that's what I have right now *[[ Seems like a slash should be placed after "though" ]] thirteen and a sixteen year old
 it is 
 they really are expensive 
 yeah
 Exactly
 Well and they 
 most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars
 So you know right now I'm looking for a little truck for my for my son
 so that you know an older older older truck 
 so I can afford it
 but you know I I just look forward to him helping me out because I for years just car drove in carpools all over the place 
 and And it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store will you take his sister somewhere something like that
 Right 
 exactly 
 Right 
 That's right
 It does for ever
 And then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren 
 so 
 It's not ending is it 
 You think we've talked a long a long enough time
 they come in see this is the first time I've done this
 in ten minutes you have to talk that long
 Uh-huh 
 Oh
 I see
 I see
 Are you from the 
 where are you from
 my gosh I'm from Plano Texas which is which is outside of Dallas
 Yeah 
 because that's where T I is 
 That makes sense
