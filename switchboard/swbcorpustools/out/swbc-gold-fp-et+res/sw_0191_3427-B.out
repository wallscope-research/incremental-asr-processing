 more than likely it's going to be a Chrysler
 Chrysler LeBaron 
 yeah 
 It won't be a Ford 
 I've got a Ford Mustang now 
 and I hate it
 Yeah
 It's a eighty-eight
 It's 
 I've had one problem with it after the other
 The pa- the paints peeling off of it 
 and there's no reason for it you know *[[ Should end in a slash not continue over to B14 which is a response to A13 ]] Fix or repair daily *[[ Should be an indep slash unit--is an answer to A13 and not related to B12 utt2 ]] or find them re- road dead
 That 
 I 
 it's 
 my electrical system shorted out like two or three times 
 and it's been torn up since April 
 and I and luckily everything was under warranty 
 so it's only costing like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed 
 It would have been like two thousand 
 Those those are nice cars
 the gas mileage for one thing 
 and I've I've I've always had like stick shift 
 I want to the next car I get I want it to be automatic
 I I I hate driving anyway 
 and then and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now
 Yeah
 And you know when you work nine to five or eight to five and you're in rush hour traffic to and from work unfortunately
 And I look 
 and one of the things with Chrysler right now is is their the warranties that they have 
 and I I feel like their 
 everybody I've talked to that owns one has has has been real pleased with it 
 and I like the the driver's air bag 
 I like that
 yeah 
 well all Chrysler products has it in there 
 but LeBaron would be the next car I get 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I like I like that too 
 but I I couldn't afford the insurance on one of those 
 Yeah
 Well that's what I'm paying on mine now 
 I had to get like a first time 
 my dad's always cosigned on on my my loans or whatever 
 and this is one when I bought 
 I got my Mustang this time was by myself because I got on my own or whatever 
 and I had said 
 they they said it had to be like a first time buyer's car or whatever 
 and they're charging me unreasonable interest 
 but I've got eight more payments 
 and it's paid for
 But I got it when I got it when the eighty-eights first came out 
 it's a it's it's a good car I got in eighty-seven I guess in like November or something like that 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Well that's another big factor of mine 
 Next next car I get's going to be a four door too Something with some room
 Because I my Mustang is is is two door with bucket seats 
 and you buy groceries and stuff like that
