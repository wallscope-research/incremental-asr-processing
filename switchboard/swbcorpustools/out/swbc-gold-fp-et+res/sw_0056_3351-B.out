 Yes
 Yes 
 I have a dog and cat now
 Tibby and Liberty
 Tibby is the dog 
 and Liberty is the cat
 Oh
 Ours are pretty calm
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Our cat we got from the pound the day bef- the night she was going to be put to sleep 
 So that's why we call her Liberty
 Do you want to hear about my other animals I've had
 I've had a skunk
 I've had a Burmese python 
 I've had rats 
 I've had mice
 let's see 
 I've had gerbils 
 I have I had a son he's now gone from the home that was an animal lover
 So at one point I had a snake skunk dog and cat running loose in the house
 Yes
 it was litter trained
 and we had it perfumed
 and it was very aggressive
 But all the all three of them dog cat and skunk used to chase each other all through the house
 And the only thing we have with the skunk he was very very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa
 Nobody came near it when he was there
 Oh
 Yeah 
 they ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them 
 but the glands had been removed 
 so 
 Right
 One other question we had is Why do you have pets
*[[should be 2 slash units b/c A answers the question]] Yeah 
 I always said if I di- Well I always said if I died I'd come back as a dog 
 That'd be the best way to be
 Well we had a German Shepherd 
 and he had dysplasia
 and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went
 So when he died we got a little one
 But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old 
 and it just you know was almost cruel because 
 Yeah 
 he just he couldn't get up 
 he couldn't walk 
 so he was a hundred and twenty pounds 
 so it was a chore
 So we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened it would be easier to carry
 And then we've had three cats in our married life 
 and we've got a calico now
 Do you
 
 Yeah 
 well don't even talk to me 
 I when I was single I had gone away for the weekend 
 and my husband then fianc3e was to keep my cat 
 and he let her out 
 and my house was loaded with fleas 
 you walked in 
 and your legs were just black
 And we had such a time and never got the cat back
 Yeah 
 I found it you know in the street
 I was a social worker at the time and found it
