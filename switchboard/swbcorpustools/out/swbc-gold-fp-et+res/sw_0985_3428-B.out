 Well I guess I stand on on probably ten for no restrictions 
 I recently just moved to Texas from South Dakota and Nebraska 
 and I guess in terms of gun control I've always been raised with the idea in the Constitution that citizens had a right to bear arms 
 and I realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded more of a national defense than anything else 
 but on the other hand too people then needed to use firearms for survival in terms of food
 and I was raised you know hunting all the time 
 I lived on the farm and you know enjoy hunting 
 and I guess I have some problems with being restricted to owning a gun for you know hunting purposes mainly
 And it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where eventually we may not be able to have that right any more
 Yeah 
 it moving to this area of course it happens everywhere 
 but I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns in the midwest and then moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings 
 and there seems like killing for no reason at all 
 and 
 I I think so 
 and and there's always the the the old saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll they'll get one 
 and and then 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's for sure
 Yeah 
 and and you know I suppose years ago way back when when they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they were fed up with the government 
 and if they didn't have a way to to fight back they would have been in big trouble
 Well the way things are going
 Well you know they introduced some gun control back when I was a teenager I believe in terms of every gun you ha- bought had to be licensed I believe
 And you know that didn't bother me too much 
 and so I guess it depends if there are some statistics that show that that people commit crimes on the spur of the moment
