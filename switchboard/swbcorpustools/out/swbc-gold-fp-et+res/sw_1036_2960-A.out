 Well do you watch much T V
 Your kids 
 How many kids do you have
 goodness
 I have got two
 That is about all I want 
 Yeah 
 they do 
 They are still babies
 well We have only get two channels 
 We do not have cable
 But I am not crazy about T V much 
 It just 
 well it kind of is an idiot box 
 Now SESAME STREET is a good program because 
 I do have that on videotape 
 and I will let him watch that every once in a while 
 And he has learned to count to twenty from that 
 So 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Right
 Right
 But they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do
 Yeah
 I love QUANTUM LEAP
 yes That is a good show
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 He always got to change history is what it is
 Usually yeah
 That it is so good 
 I was glad when they put that back on this channel because like I said we only get two channels because we do not get cable
 And still my little boy he watches videotapes 
 He won't 
 this is terrible 
 I do not like him sitting in front of the T V all day
 Well It 
 but it is a not really a good baby sitter 
 It is really not 
 He needs to get outside and play 
 And he is four years old 
 and he just does not like to go out there by himself 
 And I will let him watch the T V when I am wanting to get my house work done
 But other than that I do not like him glued to the T V all the time
 Huh-uh
 Uh-huh
 Well we made the mis- 
 Right 
 We made the mistake of getting ROBOCOP 
 And that is one of the worst 
 I do not let him watch it anymore Because the the pieces like especially where they kill somebody it is just not good 
 it is just real violent 
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 You would see somebody get shot 
 they would just fall down
 Yeah
 So graphic
 Today it is it is really graphic 
 They try to make it too realistic
 And 
 Yeah
 Now he is watching HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS right now
 It is it is cute
 And that 
 little ROGER RABBIT on before that
 That is cute 
 And they have got THE HE MAN MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE the movie 
 That is a real cute show
 HE MAN
 Yeah 
 good versus evil
 
 well it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 They do have like those parental control things on the remote controls You know where you can block out what channels you do not want them to watch
 Uh-huh
 Well my my stepfather and them have my stepfather my father-in-law and them have that
 And they do not have any kids 
 but they was told how to use that 
 But still when the kids get older they learn how to break through that parental control
 
 I think alls you have to do is push a couple buttons
 So it is it is I am hoping that he will grow up not really caring much for those movies because now we have got a lot of western tapes
 JOSEY WELLS now he loves to watch JOSEY WELLS
 Yeah
 Clint Eastwood
 And like THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER we have 
 my husband likes westerns 
 And he also likes STAR TREK 
 Now STAR TREK is good movies good shows
 The series 
 We have got a lot of those
 Uh-huh
 THE NEXT GENERATION
 Yeah 
 My little boy is crazy about Captain Kirk
 And my little girl has Mister Spock's ears 
 I told my husband he cursed my kids
 They were both born with pointy ears
 Not real pointy 
 My little boy grew out of it
 No
 Kirk Douglas
 Michael Landon
 now there 
 Yeah
 Like HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN
 <> Here are some cookies Kyle 
 <> Yeah 
 I liked HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN 
 and I and I thought that was kind of neat though 
 But I loved LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE especially when Melissa Gilbert grew up
 She was kind of like my idol when I was growing up Because I am twenty-seven 
 so it is you know 
 she is about the same age as I am
 I wanted to be just like her because she is so cute
 Yeah 
 and 
 well 
 I liked it
 but there 
 that is about the only show I have seen where every time they sit down at the table they pray before they eat 
 And I thought that was real neat Because there is not a lot of shows that do that 
 And they have this little cartoon that is on Sunday mornings with Jot 
 I remember him in school 
 but I do not 
 it is just this little dot with arms and feet and little eyes 
 and his parents are there 
 They have it like before one of the church things you know church that comes on 
 And it is a just this little dot 
 And he will go out and get himself into trouble and come home 
 and the parents will tell him that there is a verse in the Bible that will help him with that 
 and It is just 
 Well it is 
 usually we go to church on Sundays
 But we will miss every once in a while 
 And I will let Kyle watch that 
 and he just 
 well I even like Jot 
 I 
 it is funny
 It is on channel 
 well let us see 
 You are in Plano
 it is twelve or ten down here
 well this is of the mornings
 around nine or ten I think 
 It is before one of the I think it is before the First Baptist in Sherman airs
 I think that is the one that it comes on before
 It is real cute 
 You know what 
 He is bouncing around 
 and his name is Jot 
 and then he has got a friend named Cat 
 And I think the dog is the only one that is not a a dot 
 But it is real cute 
 And like I say they they teach him stuff from the BIBLE 
 And I think it is just a real cute show 
 I am trying to get my little boy into reading like church books and things
 We have got like NOAH'S ARK and LORD IS MY SHEP- 
 We have got about eight or twelve books for him just little Bible stories
 And they- 
 he is he is getting to where he likes them
 We got him a little Jesus doll about a year ago 
 and he has always kept that 
 He likes it 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So it's a a Christian songs
 that sounds fun
 That's something 
 Well 
 Yeah
