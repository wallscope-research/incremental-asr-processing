 but we're learning a lot 
 and we have a home computer 
 so it's it's very interesting
 Yeah 
 the subject of music 
 I play I play piano 
 I took lessons for thirteen years 
 and right now my nine year old is taking piano 
 and I just got a whole mess of music 
 I I play the volunteer to play the piano at the children's Christmas program for the whole grade school which is K through six five hundred kids
 I did it last year 
 and and I I just sub at the school 
 I don't want to work full time 
 so I just sub at the school 
 and that's kind of my volunteer thing 
 so that it it's really neat 
 and my older daughter plays the saxophone 
 my next son plays the drums 
 and my third son just started baritone this year 
 and my little girl will start French horn next year 
 so 
 Oh
 French horn is absolutely wonderful instrument 
 It's just my favorite 
 Of course that's what I played 
 and so I'm pushing that on my daughter because I want to play in our city band not the symphony with just the city band once we get the the French horn 
 and I get a little bit more time 
 Right now I'm busy chasing my kids
 I do I do I love it 
 but we have a a marvelous band instructor 
 and and he's just he's wonderful 
 We have couple of hundred kids in the band 
 our junior high band is just wonderful
 He lot 
 and their concert band 
 and then he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in 
 and my son will be in next year
