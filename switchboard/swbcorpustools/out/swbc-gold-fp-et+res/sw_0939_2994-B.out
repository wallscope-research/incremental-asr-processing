 Well a little bit 
 we mostly do our newspapers 
 We keep our newspapers and stuff like that and we keep our newspapers and stuff like that 
 and we take them to be recycled
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 And a lot of people complain because it's really not convenient for them
 You're supposed to what
 But what are you supposed to do with them
 okay
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 We we usually collect a you know collect a quite a bit 
 and then we take them take them in
 Yeah 
 we don't we don't use aluminum cans
 so we generally don't have those to do
 You know they they charge you you know 
 it's like a flat rate I think for picking up your garbage
 And I know a lot of people it would would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup 
 and some communities are trying to do that now 
 And I think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling 
 they they charged you by by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill
 That that might be a better way to do it 
 And then people would would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash
 You know because then it would then it would make monetary sense to them you know to say hey you know if I just spend the time to to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then I don't have to pay for them hauling it off
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 that's about the same kind of thing
 Where do you live
 okay
 Yes
 It seems like they would be able to 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 now I didn't know that 
 cause we just usually if we're going to buy sodas they're in the the two liter bottles
 Yeah
 Okay
 Okay
 All right 
 bye-bye <>
