 I'm ready 
 I just like a nice quiet nice atmosphere and of course good food 
 That's always that's always a concern but just a nice quiet easy place maybe candlelight something just to relax you know because I don't really go out to dinner that much 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 where you don't feel rushed you know
 and you can just relax and stay as long as you want
 Well nearby 
 We're almost in Dallas 
 We're just north of Dallas
 So we have quite a bit between us and there 
 It's about ten miles
 and there is all kinds of restaurants 
 and I had one that was a favorite for a long time 
 and then it changed hands and doubled the prices 
 and then it finally went out of business
 So but it was really nice 
 It had a fireplace
 Yeah 
 it was really nice 
 They had entertainment sometimes 
 and you could just really relax there and enjoy it
 But it's gone 
 Uh-huh
 that's nice
 Uh-huh
 Right
 That is probably very fortunate for you 
 Do you have kids
 Yeah
 because I have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night you know 
 and now's she's graduated to two cheeseburgers 
 so something's happened here 
 but but you know McDonald's is definitely at the top of her list 
 and I hate these places
 Uh-huh 
 they do 
 and I don't think there's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have
 Well we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around
 and it's really it's tempting when you come home from work 
 and you're tired 
 and you know you just are tempted to give in to that 
 and it costs a lot of money to do it too
 You know it adds up 
 and it's not healthy 
 and I really got into that habit for a while 
 but I got out of it again because I just felt like it was just too unhealthy
 So 
 Well how's California today 
 Is it 
 That's what I've heard yeah
 Have you always lived there
 Oh
 And you like it
 Yeah 
 we've been
 yeah
 that would be fun
 Yeah 
 Do you miss living there
 No 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 
 Yeah
 yeah 
 I go all the time
 Yeah 
 well I have a twenty-one year old daughter in college there
 and she is a world champion twirler
 and her coach is in California 
 So she went there for six years
 So I went out a lot with her
 And yeah 
 I know California pretty well
 And I love it 
 and we tug back and forth who's going to move 
 but I think he's going to move because I'm the person with more to lose here
 I have my twelve year old in school
 and she's happy 
 She always lived here in the south 
 and I have my house 
 so I have too much to lose
