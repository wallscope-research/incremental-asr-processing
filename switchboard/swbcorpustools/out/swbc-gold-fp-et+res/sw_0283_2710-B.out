 I started when I was in college 
 You know they always offer credit cards for college students
 So I went ahead and accepted every one that I was offered Because I knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early
 So I p- I pack around a lot of them 
 but I only use a few of them
 Yeah
 And they give you such high credit limits
 It's it's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap
 Yeah 
 I've got I've got two that I you know that usually I'll have a balance on
 And then all of the others I just try to use kind of like you would an American Express card and and pay it off every month
 And that way I feel like I'm getting you know a thirty day loan
 But I don't have to worry about you know running them up too high except at Christmas 
 Then they usually go then they usually get run up pretty good
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Now that's one that's 
 I've never used my Visa for cash before
 Can you use it like at a bank machine 
 j- 
 or 
 Yeah
 okay 
 Yeah
 Now we got 
 that's that's funny you said that Because we got a credit card my husband and I got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for
 Now a couple of weeks later we got we got pin numbers 
 and then we got a bill saying you know the yearly fee it was like forty dollars
 And we we cut them up and sent them back because we we hadn't even applied for them 
 and we didn't want them 
 But they they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us
 So I thought man I don't know if I trust this or not 
 It's like let's see if we can get her to run up her bills 
 But it's hard 
 it's it's tempting when you see something to say "Well I'll just charge it" 
 And sometimes I'll do that 
 but usually I I will try to pay everything off the next month 
 or the ones that usually have an outstanding balance all the time I'll I'll pay more than the minimum payment
 Just I fe- I feel like even that little bit helps
 I know it
 Well I work for T I too
 And I think they're getting ready to to probably sell us out our division
 In Johnson City Tennessee
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 They just they just announced that didn't they
 So it's it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards
 Uh-huh
 Man
 Yeah
 Oh
 Didn't pay them
 Man
 That's scary
 I didn't realize that
 Yeah
 okay
 They don't they don't recognize any time difference do they
 Ooh 
 that's scary
 That's something I never thought about getting you know checking with to see what what your credit report looked like
 Might be worth it for peace of mind
 Yeah
 I think that Discover Card has a good idea with you know giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you you purchase As long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back
 And since they don't have the yearly fee
 I don't know
 I've never I haven't gotten one Just because it's 
 I felt like with Visa and Mastercard and American Express you didn't need another one
 I would think it wouldn't be you know much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges
 So that that wouldn't be too bad
 Yeah
 Holy cow
 Definitely
 That's awful 
 there's no point in giving them any more money than we have to
 So 
 that's great
 I'll try to remember that one
 Well let's see 
 I was trying to think if there was anything else 
 the I guess the worst problem I ever had with with a credit card though was I got a an item on my bill that I had never purchased
 I had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork 
 but they weren't supposed to process it until they delivered it
 And I changed my mind
 but then they went ahead and charged it on my account
 And it took me about eighteen months to get that all of that mess off of my account
 So that's that's probably the worst thing I've ever had happen with a credit card
