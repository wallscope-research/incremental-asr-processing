 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 It doesn't matter to me
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Well how did they feel about the the United States interven- intervening with Patriot missiles 
 did did they 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I live in San Antonio 
 and fifty percent of the population is minority
 Uh-huh 
 That's the barrios 
 but i- it's it's I don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city 
 It's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks
 I grew up outside of Houston 
 and I don't think as far as gang violence and things I don't think it's any worse here than in Houston
 Houston is not at all
 Yes 
 there's quite a bit of crime
 Uh-huh 
 
 I think it's unfortunate as far as the Kurds are concerned 
 it 
 <> I thi- 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 we can't get involved in their civil war unfortunately 
 but we've kind of driven these people out
 Sure
 Well I think the war ended too soon
 Yeah
 We we didn't damage enough of their arsenal 
 We damaged most of it 
 but we we should have gotten made sure we got everything
 Unfortunately though the the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of Kuwait 
 And once that was accomplished <> it 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 I just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet That I I still feel like there's more to come 
 I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned
 They've got sixty or so of Iraq's planes
 Uh-huh
 There are some Kurds living in Iran
 I was real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as as much as they did
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it and from from what I can tell if they had gotten into it it would have started a whole new war
