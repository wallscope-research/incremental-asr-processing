 Okay 
 what are your favorite things to watch
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 We do not watch a lot of T V 
 we try to watch it on Thursday nights 
 we usually watch L A LAW 
 I like that real well And CHEERS
 we like to watch that 
 we sort of got hooked on LA LAW 
 do you ever watch that
 Yeah 
 And I I have watched THIRTYSOMETHING some in the last couple seasons 
 I was sort of sorry to see it go too
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I thought a lot of the 
 like the problems that Michael and Hope had in their marriage and stuff I can relate to some of those things
 Just the dynamics of it and everything
 really 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 you are too tired to do anything 
 it's better to spend time with your kids I think though than glued in front of the T V anyway
 Probably more worthwhile 
 I just don't I don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be really
 Right 
 yeah 
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I have seen parts of that before 
 it is interesting
 Do you watch sports much on T V
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 It's slow
 Yeah 
 we are like that 
 and occasionally we will like on if we do not have anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or something we will watch a little bit of a golf tournament 
 But you can not take a whole lot of that either 
 it's pretty slow
 Yeah 
 Do you wa- 
 we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home because there's just on Friday and Saturday nights there's nothing good on 
 and 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Do you have cable T V
 We do not either 
 I thought we were the only ones who did not have it
 Uh-huh 
 Gosh 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well we had it for awhile 
 and it just seemed like we never watched it 
 any we did not have the movie channels 
 we just had all the normal ones that come 
 and we just never watched any of them 
 we kept a log for a month of every time we watched it 
 and it seemed like we did not watch even half an hour
 so we decided to just cancel it 
 It does improve the reception a little bit though 
 that's the only thing
 Yeah
 Well I can not think of too much else to say *[[typo cannot]] Since we are not big watchers
 Well it was nice talking to you
 Bye
