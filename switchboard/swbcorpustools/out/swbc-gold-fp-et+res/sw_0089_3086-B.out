 I have a personal computer at home 
 It's an A T compatible 
 I don't use it very much any more 
 I used to use it quite a bit
 I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal 
 I do some P C stand alone work on it 
 and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame
 What about you 
 Do you own a computer
 Are you leasing them
 Loaners from work
 Do you work for T I
 What brand are they
 Uh-huh
 I'm jealous
 What kind of consulting do you do
 Uh-huh
 What kind of work do you do when you're consulting
 Is it programming related
 Uh-huh
 Word processing
 No I'm not familiar with that
 Uh-huh
 So you've got you've got a modem in it then
 At home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them
 and so it's an external modem
 I got when I got mine I had an internal modem in it
 I used it quite a bit when I was looking at information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in a in Fort Worth
 but went out of town for a while 
 and and sort of got off the bulletin board and off of my micro completely
 and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without even without using it on the computer 
 I could turn a computer on 
 it'd start squawking 
 So I finally opened up the box and took it out
 I think that's the thirty second warning
 Yes
 Okay 
 Where Where are you 
 and 
 Are you at home now
 So you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
 What time is it now where you are
 So you're an hour ahead of where I am 
 I'm in Central Central time zone
 No 
 I haven't done that 
 I know someone who has 
 and and she's very pleased with it 
 She told me some of the things you can do 
 and it's just a a very handy tool to have
 Yeah 
 and you can do a l- 
 it makes things very convenient 
 You can save a lot of money too Certainly cut down on long distance charges if you if that's what you have in mind
 I have I have used Lotus 
 I have used Word Perfect
 I 
 not heavy use 
 I've used D Base 
 and I've used a substantial amount of shareware 
 I haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job 
 I've been through three classes
 and I have a great deal of respect for it
 I haven't done much word processing work with my job 
 I do some
 and I 
 and the D Base work I've done was strictly class related
 Well it's probably the granddaddy of most data base management systems
 It's got some pretty strong competitors 
 Some of them have reviews that are better than D Base 
 so I I think by now it's a matter of personal taste
 I can understand that very easily 
 I've used I've had a class on R Base and also in Paradox
 and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base
 I wouldn't say compatible but certainly comparable
 Uh-huh
 I'm a computer programmer on the I B M main frames
 I do main- mainly business data processing
 I also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility
 sometimes I get called late at night at home because there's a production problem 
 and that gives me the opportunity to come in to work and fix it if I can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone
 I also handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected
