 Okay you say you're going to buy a new car
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I I understand that 
 We just paid off one my wife's car I guess la- early last year 
 and so we're you know enjoying not having that that payment every every month 
 and but it's getting up in age 
 we're trying to hold out a little while longer 
 we've got a a y- kno- sho- a daughter who's almost two now 
 so we're getting to the point where we really kind of need something a little bigger than what we've got 
 but so I guess if we when we do buy another car it'll it'll be something that we can kind of grow into a little bit 
 It's it's tough on trips because anywhe- anytime we we're getting ready to go anywhere it's you know it's try like trying to put a puzzle together to make sure you get everything in the car you know cause it's 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 that's what 
 I I ideally I would like that in fact you know I I've I've thought of that possibly getti- 
 I don't know that my wife would go for it 
 but You know I would I'd like to do that
 I I have a truck myself 
 and i- I'll I'll take you know 
 a truck's a thing that yo- you you need when you need it 
 but you know the rest of the time you wonder you know could I use something else
 So I I've still got a couple years payments on it 
 I may 
 if we can hold out til then you know I may get get to where I need a something else maybe maybe buy a van because they are really really nice for for long trips especially
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Right
 
 Right
 I don't either
 Well my wife's car is probably around five years old now
 and it's it's got 
 I guess it must have seventy or eighty thousand miles on it you know 
 and so it it's getting 
 it's not not in bad shape 
 it's it's you know she's kept it up real well 
 but you know it's it's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it you know if we're going to get anything out of selling it
 So I'm I'm I'm I'm hoping we that we can work something out here 
 We've got other bills that kind of pre- precede or preclu- preclude us buying something buying something else
 It really is 
 and you know and you can't you can't afford you know a a car payment now 
 It just will wipe you out every month 
 it's almost getting to be like the house payment you know
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 I didn't know that
 Uh-huh
 man 
 yeah
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 n- 
 that's that's our pro- our our daughter's problem you know 'cause when you when you get out on the road like that and it's just long stretches you know where they just have to sit you know 
 In town she does okay you know 
 and even on the road she does all right for a little while because she'll sleep some
 but you know i- 
 she she wakes up 
 she wants to to get up 
 I know t- coming right around Christmas we were we were Chris- right before Christmas we had driven over to Shreveport 
 and we were driving back 
 and it was when all that bad weather was was hitting
 and the roads were all closed 
 and we were trying to get back 
 and it took us a lot longer 
 and she was you know she was pretty good most of the way 
 but then get to a point where she just had to get out of her seat and we had to stop 
 and and we got out and played in the snow and put here back in 
 *[[typo> her]] and she was fine
 but you know if we had if there was something to where she could kind of get up and move around like you say on on the highway or where where it wasn't wasn't as bad you know just for a little brief period of time it would be would be okay 
 so I'm I'm thinking maybe we can <> can do something like that later on 
 Ye- 
 we'll see what we can do
 Yeah 
 Well I gue- 
 Y- 
 you too 
 I ho- hope everything works out
 Right
