 Okay 
 Well basically I am a mother of a three year old
 so I kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that 
 And I've been pretty selective 
 and what I'm finding is with day cares that are like day care centers like for instance Learning Tree or Kinder Care and all of that
 What I find is that they're highly structured highly organized Almost too rigid for the children if you bring a child in at a certain time like nap time or whatever time because of parents' hours they are differ- 
 and when I bring my daughter into such a system like that they only have one thing going on 
 and that's nap time 
 Everybody is napping whether they came there an hour before or they came a- right during that time 
 And with that kind of a system my daughter just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down on a cot 
 So home day care has been an option 
 And I've looked into that 
 The only thing is you raise the question of if it's safe can you trust the people you know
 
 <> Uh-huh
 Sure 
 sure 
 Sure 
 That's really scary 
 And To the point that you kind of say to yourself especially home day care 
 I think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours it's fine 
 It depends on the age of the child 
 Now some children do real well that are at the age of four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while 
 but home da- home day care works well if it's an infant 
 If it's if it's if you want to have kind of like a family structuring where there's a home that they can be provided Because I've seen things at the day care where they can't keep up with all the kids 
 The kids have colds 
 and they're sick all the time 
 and the-
