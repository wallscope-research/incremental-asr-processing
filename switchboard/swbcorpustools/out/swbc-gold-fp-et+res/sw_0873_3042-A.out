 Okay
 It's real dry up here
 Yeah 
 We need rain really bad
 All the farmers you know 
 th- 
 well it's good for hay 
 You know all the farmers got their first cut of hay and everything 
 but they're going to need some mor- you know rain to get the second cut
 I I'm working for a lady who has a strawberry field 
 and if we don't have rain she's going to lose a lot of money
 Oh

 It's usually dry down there isn't it
 Uh-huh
 I hope they come this way
 really
 Uh-huh

 Now see every everyone up here with their gardens they're not going to have much of a garden this year because it's so dry
 Yeah
 Really

 Uh-huh
 well see now we need 
 we could use two days straight of rain
 It's really drying up up here
 Does it 
 I was telling everyone hang your clothes out on the line 
 and it's surely going to rain
 Whenever you hang your clothes out on the line it always rains 
 Uh-huh
 We've had real hot weather
 Yeah 
 yes 
 We you know 
 and let me think 
 I got out of school in May 
 In March I was wearing shorts
 I was wearing shorts in March up at college 
 and we w- 
 what they said is that this area has had its summer weather in the spring
 Is what they said what happened
 I hope that 
 I don't know 
 But 
 I hope that doesn't mean we're going to get an early winter
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I was wearing shorts in March 
 You know it was nippy
 but like it was still in the seventies
 You know high sixties low seventies in March
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Yeah

 my gosh
 
 Really
 See I like I like the snow 
 but I like to watch it fall 
 and I just like it where it's deep enough you know but not too deep
 Really
 Well isn't it weird at Christmas time without snow
 Oh
 Yeah
 Well it's real dry down there 
 You don't have the humidity either do you
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 muggy huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 See that's what's bad up here is when we do get the real you know hundred and the high nineties we have the humidity to go with it
 so you're like real mucky 
 and you you know 
 yo- your legs stick together just from walking you know
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah

 Well I don't know 
 Well I guess that's really about all
