 Yeah 
 the changing roles of women how roles changed 
 and what do you see coming in the future
 Okay 
 yeah 
 Sounds good
 Okay 
 hold on
 Are you there
 my goodness 
 I can't believe I did that 
 Okay 
 hold on
 Okay 
 I 
 No 
 I I'm twenty-three
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 I know that th- 
 Uh-huh 
 I know that in in the early seventies I think women were the first people to to make a move as far as individuals
 before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like black people or you know just large large groups of people 
 but but the 
 Right
 and I think I think the women's movement kind of brought in individual lives where you had women's movements 
 and you had gay movements and just the smaller groups of people
 And I think since then is is when a lot of the women's roles have started to change
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Exactly 
 Uh-huh 
 I think that you know you can just look at home life and see I've been talking to a lot of people a- about education and things and and what what what affects the school system 
 and I think that a big thing that effects it is that the mother is not home anymore like she used to be 
 She used to be kind of a kind of a a rock you know in the house 
 yeah 
 And since since everyone is going out and working now whether it be because of finances or just the economy the mother's not there anymore 
 and the children are 
 I think I think a lot of society is suffering 
 Not to say that women shouldn't you know go out and do what they want to do 
 but I think that society's really going to have to get used to it 
 And they're not quite used to it yet 
 and that's I 
 Yes 
 uh-huh
 Right 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Speaking of getting married I was talking to someone yesterday on this on the project
 and we were talking about child care 
 and he asked me if I had any kids 
 He was about forty or fifty years old 
 and I said no I'm just twenty
 and I said no I'm just twenty-three you know because I don't think of myself as needing to have children 
 but h- the first thing he says is well don't you miss that part of your life 
 And I just 
 I 
 my my mind just went
 I went what You know 
 because it d- it really didn't doesn't even occur to me right now to have children 
 becau- 
 Yeah 
 and I it just you know 
 I think that I'll probably have children when I'm about thirty thirty-five something like just because I'm not sure if it's just if it's just me or or women in general that are twenty-three right now because I'm really into my career 
 I'm trying to go somewhere and and get there quick and then worry about you know because right now in my career I'm I'm really starting out 
 and it's going to take me a while to move up
 And I don't need anything kind of holding me back 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it's it's just really not there anymore
 And that that has to do with you know the women getting out and other women seeing women seeing other women you know out in the corporate world
 That's like I can do that 
 You know maybe I don't need to get married 
 She's she's about forty 
 Uh-huh 
 Okay 
 I I just turned twenty-three April twentieth 
 and I'm still going you know my God I'm s- getting so old 
 I just 
 because me myself I just like to move really really quickly
 I like to 
 anything I do 
 I got out of school quick 
 I'm you know I'm working quick 
 I want to move up quick 
 I want to make money quick 
 I want to retire quick
 And so anything 
 i- i- when the age creeps up where I'm twenty-three and twenty-four I'm thinking my time is running out You know 
 but I'm actually very very young
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 exactly 
 Exactly 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I think I think a lot of people probably feeling that way 
 I know I'm probably feeling that way because it's everything's geared towards young You know 
 and whether I want to realize it or not everything on television is young young young young 
 You can't be a model after thirty 
 you can't do this after twenty you know 
 and e- y- everybody that's in the music business is starting out at fifteen You know 
 and so I feel like I'm old 
 It's like I sing I sing 
 and I would really love to become a professional singer 
 but I think I'm too old now
 and I'm twenty-three 
 because everyone I've seen coming up they're fifteen You know 
 and so I'm going I'm so old 
 and I'm I I really have to always tell myself no you're not you're very young
 And you know so it's 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Wow
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 very true
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that's that's why I say I feel I feel really lucky right now b- because I'm not married and because I don't have children 
 I'm out of school 
 I'm twenty-three 
 I can do anything I want to do anything
 And so even some days I'm looking for another job now 
 but and I get so depressed because not because I can't find a job but because I can't figure out what I want to do
 And yeah 
 and I thi- 
 and I'm lucky though because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee I don't know what to do 
 I have so mu- you know 
 not a lot of people
 but it's depressing too
 What do you what do you that you're 
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh 
 Huh 
 okay 
 I'm a I'm a news reporter now
 and what I'm looking for is something in I really don't want to stay in news 
 but I would like to stay in journalism
