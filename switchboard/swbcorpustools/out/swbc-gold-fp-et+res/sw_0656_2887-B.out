 Yeah 
 I agree on that 
 And you know it seems pa- 
 compared to what we our salary is versus what our health care is our health care keeps increasing increasing increasing and not to the same rate as our pay 
 Right 
 Me either 
 Uh-huh 
 Yes
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 Money instead
 Yeah 
 Right 
 I feel the same way actually 
 we don't use any of T Is benefits other than I I buy bonds and and that's it 
 because 
 Not at all
 My husband's 
 yes 
 we use my husband's
 He he works for Bramalea Company 
 and they pay one hundred percent
 Not one dime is deducted from his check
 Bramalea
 It's a security company 
 and and building they own a lot of buildings and lease buildings
 And 
 Yeah 
 actually they're from Canada 
 They're Canada based
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 yeah 
 it's all taken care Yeah but our prescriptions and everything our visits to the doctor our hospitalization 
 the only thing we pay for is if if something happened an emergency and we had to have an ambulance 
 it's twenty-five dollars
 that's nothing
 Really 
 yeah 
 well T I was getting for the both of us it was like seventy-five dollars a month You know deducted for an H M O 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Okay
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 yeah
 We don't either 
 Neither one of us do
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Exactly 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Exactly
 You can't charge more for a person who's on a flight just because they're larger *[[needs slash unit]] Yeah
 I don't know
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 they are as far as their like pension plans 
 they're vested a lot earlier 
 I think at T I it took five years
 Five to seven
 And they're vested after their first year To- totally vested
 And they have the four one K and the usual benefits like that 
 Right 
 right 
 No 
 they match the same amount
 Yeah 
 well they match four percent which is the same You know fifty percent or four percent
*[[listen; particularly nonsensical]] Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 It's 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 that and I know that's a big issue 
 because I I belong to a women's forum group
 And some of the questions we're getting are are on site day care and things like that
 That they consider a very serious benefit 
 And I can't tell you anybody right now at T I that's considering that
 They should be though
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 a lot better 
 E D S is m- is better than Spring Creek
 man 
 Yeah
 yeah
 People 
 yeah
 I see 
 Right
 Yeah
 That's good 
 That's a that's a fortunate benefit you know that they're so active for their employees
 uh-huh 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Me too
 Me too 
 because you know with utilities and and homes that are 
 price of homes have went up dr- drastically 
 Like an average house is now a hundred and thirty thousand 
 And that is unreal because we've got people out here that are just poverty level 
 But then we've got these million dollar homes 
 so you know where do you find a happy medium 
 And how does your salary deal with that 
 It's not
 It's just not doing it
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 That's true 
 That is exactly where we are 
 It's so strange 
 Common problem
 Yeah 
 really
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah 
 and I think Dallas as far as economic uncertainty is better than what most of the country is
 So wer- somehow we're better off than a lot of them
 No 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Empowerment issues
 Right
 Well very well 
 it's slow though
 At least they're making the effort to put it out there and make it available and and cultural change within the management first 
 And now it's kind of filtering down to the peon level
 But I think they're really trying
 It's going to take years though
 it's just it's that mind-set has to change 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Doesn't want to change
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Okay Yeah 
 me too 
 Go- good talking to you
 Thanks
 Okay 
 Bye-Bye
