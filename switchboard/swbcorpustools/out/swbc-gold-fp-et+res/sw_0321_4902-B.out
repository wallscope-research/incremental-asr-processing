 yes 
 I do as far as as far as as far as immigration as a whole goes
 I think that we simply must start accepting everybody in the world
 I 
 there just is not going to be room for all of us 
 We don't have jobs now 
 I I think I think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time 
 I hope you're one of the employed right now
 I am one of the unemployed right now
 I was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company 
 and I applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings 
 but they had two thousand applications
 And I know that there are a lot of foreigners here you know doing my line of work
 And of course I'm not perfectly happy about not having a job
 So how do you feel
 Right 
 Okay 
 and I think you're right in both cases
 <> And I think probably it's pretty important right there 
 How do you feel about Haitian immigration
 Actually actually I feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here
 And it would have nothing to do with political situations 
 It would have to do with poverty
 my gosh
 Have you been have you been to southern Florida
 Well and the two of them together 
 we can 
 it's just as well you know 
 it's hardly America anymore
 But there's some differences in the immigrants that that we're getting now 
 Well I particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration
 I think probably your a great deal of what you say is true about the legals
 But the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now they do not come here to blend into America 
 they they don't bother to learn our language 
 and first of all th- they 
 this I really feel strongly about this 
 We send a lot of money to Mexico
