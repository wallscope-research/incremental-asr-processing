 I have ambivalent feelings because I don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is 
 But on the other hand it is very very expensive to maintain 
 you know Texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country
 And it's eating us alive budget wise 
 and 
 Yes 
 we do practice capital punishment 
 but the nature of the courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed
 Yeah 
 And then I was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because I had forgotten I guess that I wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody th- than it does to keep them Because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know
 Well I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people You know who would see it
 Yeah 
 but I'm not sure how successful that is
 Quicker maybe 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 What what kind of work do you do
 well see I'm a school principal
 Elementary school
 And in a very poor section of town with p- predominantly Anglo kids 
 And I see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do 
 and see I'm afraid I think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people that 
 course you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there
 but I think we would make a bigger investment in kids 
 we'd have fewer decisions to make Down the road you know
 yeah
 Well I'm not talking about just in the school system
 See I'm talking about 
 like in in 
 I'm afraid I think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared 
 I know the institutions don't work that well 
 but it's a bad day because I get all these kids through my office 
 I have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids
 Five hundred of them are good solid kids 
 and I have the same thirty-seven in my office every day
 And a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible 
 Some of them in the penal system
 And you know you just see those kids going down the road 
 Now not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment 
 but some of them have already been in youth centers And that kind of thing 
 and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals 
 and I'm not talking about necessarily in the school system 
 I'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action
 I think that's one reason we have problems in schools 
 and some of them are our problems 
 but a lot of it's because everything society wants we are supposed to do
 But that's another subject 
 but 
 I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has making a decision what to do with them
 Uh-huh
 I don't I don't know that there is an easy solution 
 but if you could find a way to prevent some of it and I'm not sure what it would be It would be money better spent than 
 do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard
 That's true
 Statistically that's true
 Uh-huh
 Are you for it
 I'm for it in in some cases 
 Yeah 
 What kind of crimes would you d- use it for
 Uh-huh
 I I would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going You know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children
 Well you know somebody elected that recently
 And all the civil rights people are up in arms about it you know
 But
