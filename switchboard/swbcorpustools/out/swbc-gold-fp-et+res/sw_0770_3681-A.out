 Okay 
 you got any hobbies that you want to talk about
 What in the world do you do with your computer that takes so much time
 really
 Did you have your own business 
 or you do that as just on the side or what
 Uh-huh
 Well
 What do you teach
 that's good
 Uh-huh
 Well I play trombone in the Plano Community Band
 And I like to do a lot of bicycling when the weather allows and during summer when there's daylight savings time's when I get out and bike
 Well it wasn't too bad other than the Cowboys didn't do so hot
 No 
 just a crummy well actually 
 the Lions are pretty good I'm afraid they pro- a lot better team than the Cowboys were today 
 And 
 okay 
 I I play that about six times a year 
 and every year I hang my bag up if I get that five or six 
 and I swear swear that game off for another year 
 but I always go back to it 
 I understand that 
 Well you do lots of stuff
 Gosh 
 I come up there I'll have to stop by and have try some of your baking
 I call on people in 
 My business is machine tool sales 
 and I have some 
 I I cover Texas and Oklahoma
 So I what I said that I wasn't being real facetious about that 
 I got customers in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and Perry Oklahoma and Eda and all that all that way
 Yes 
 yes 
 I 
 about thirty-three thousand miles a year 
 So 
 Well I usually 
 see we we have our our band practice is on Monday night 
 and during the summer we we have concerts every Monday night in the park 
 and we we have you know some concerts during the year 
 and you know various people in the communities want us to play for things 
 but those are usually on the weekend 
 so that isn't too bad
 Well we got pretty good size band 
 Not everybody shows up 
 but if everyone did we'd probably have over a hundred 
 but we only average about forty to fifty people a you know usually
 Yeah
 no 
 no 
 This is a 
 it's a concert band 
 and we have a lot of 
 I I don't pretend to be that good 
 but there's a lot of people that you know are band directors at schools or have been 
 or you know there some people that are actually music majors 
 They don't necessarily follow that any more you know 
 that isn't necessarily their career 
 but we have some extremely good talent in there 
 and as a rule it sounds pretty decent 
 so 
 It's fun
 Well I don't know if I have any or not 
 I I've always enjoyed it 
 I sing in a church choir on Wednesday nights when I'm around and play in the band on Monday nights and keeps you out of trouble that way
