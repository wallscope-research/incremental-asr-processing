 It's on your favorite T V shows and why
 MAJOR DAD
 I I love it 
 I think it promotes good family values 
 and it's funny
 That's ri- 
 yeah
 What kind do you like to watch
 WONDER YEARS
 I like both of those real much also 
 I I think basically they pr- same thing they promote family values
 I do too 
 I I don't like it lot of the shows that that I've liked in the past like GOLDEN GIRLS 
 and some of them tend to get so risque 
 and when you have children watching it that sometimes really starts to bother me
 and that's one of the reasons 
 if you want to go all time favorite show probably one of them was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE
 yeah 
 which I just I was I always felt was wonderful
 and so many of them nowadays like I said I think are just 
 they they go after well 
 they 
 like I said the risque stuff just I guess they think that's what people want to watch
 Yes
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I agree 
 do you like the sports programming
 I I enjoy those also almost as as much to a certain extent 
 I'm 
 our whole house is baseball fans
 and we enjoy that 
 and 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 probably the Pirates 
 but only because of Steve Bushel I guess
 otherwise I really don't care that much 
 but you know I'm I'm annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him 
 and I'd like to see him do well like all the way to the bank I guess

 Well yeah 
 yeah 
 it's 
 so I keep hoping the Rangers are going to do 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well it's 
 so many of them now you know it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in 
 and and you know I'm you know I'm I'm an adult
 and I have adult tastes now 
 but I don't need that
 I I like things that are are wholesome I guess
 Uh-huh
 Yes

 Uh-huh
 Yeah
