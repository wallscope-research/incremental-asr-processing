 yes 
 I am 
 I'm working in the computer science department here at C M U
 I'm doing basically system system design work and implementation work for the speech for the speech group here
 Yeah 
 actually through electronic mail
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 So it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away at at this point 
 Yeah
 Well t- i- I'm research stuff here now 
 so what they they have okay benefits package 
 It's not quite as good as industry 
 but one of the significant benefits here is that you can take up to two courses a semester 
 and they pay for you know pay for the classes 
 So Carnegie Mellon that works out to be a reasonable a reasonable benefit
 Uh-huh 
 If you want to do it quickly
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 So I I don't know in in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary 
 I'd you know I 
 Yeah 
 we we do 
 We have to contribute a certain amount to it
 And it's kind of split between C M U and and you know the employee
 Right
 Yeah 
 and it's also right now it's the 
 like everywhere else 
 here in Pittsburgh the health care rates are are going up pretty quickly
 That's a whole other topic to begin with too 
 but 
 Yeah 
 but it's you are right 
 I I I really agree that that that's pretty important
 Right 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Oh 
 Now that's a big win
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 That's 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I figured for 
 and they've just raised the income caps on Social Security to the point where you have to be pretty you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying paying that as well 
 Yeah 
 well if you could call it a benefit that C M U i- 
 the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is is consult for you know other companies
 so that's that kind of helps out in terms of you know keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry
 You know in case you know in case you ever need to bail out 
 Uh-huh
