 Well I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the U S budget
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Exactly
 There's maybe some short-term things that they can do 
 and it hurts everybody's pocket of course 
 but I know that state has cutback raises for a year to help the state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition 
 That 
 State of Minnesota
 So there's the potential that perhaps you know the U S budget might want to take a look at it's federal employees or and take a look at saying well let's freeze wages 
 everybody's doing it so it isn't like private business has had to do it 
 so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a shir- that's got to be very short term
 And the only other avenue that I can think of is looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying well we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money 
 As for for instance I think you probably remember the military getting caught with toilet seats that cost them four hundred five hundred dollars
 And it was just 
 you can go to K-Mart and buy them for eight dollars or I think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats 
 so So it gives you a- idea that 
 Sure 
 sure 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Than we think
 Sure
 Sure
 Uh-huh 
 It sure is 
 The you know as far as 
 I think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days 
 and actually the conferences were nothing 
 but you know they're getting paid for this 
 and it was something more than just the conferences 
 They were using it as eating out 
 when you think about people taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress 
 The rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that
 And it's a real big crunch 
 of course when they get caught then they're you know they're guilty of course 
 but during that time I'm sure there's hundreds of thousands of people that are spending money that does not belong to them 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Exactly 
 And I don't think it's ended up being 
 it gave people jobs
 but I think it also cost quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war a lot of things were no longer put to use 
 it was kind of like okay we'll do this during this point and time 
 but after that that's you know they didn't want to do it anymore
 So a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things 
 So I don't know
 Okay 
 well it was good talking to you 
 and have a good evening
 Uh-huh 
 thanks
 Bye now
