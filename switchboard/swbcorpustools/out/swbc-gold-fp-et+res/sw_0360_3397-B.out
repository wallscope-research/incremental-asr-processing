 Kids are out

 I follow the the Cowboys 
 but that's about it 
 Yeah

 I I I am a pretty big Dallas fan been for a long time
 but I haven't been to any games recently 
 But I try to catch the game every weekend that I can
 Yeah 
 Have you ever been to a Cowboy's game
 it's pretty nice
 That's good 
 At least you follow the game a little bit
 yeah 
 I'm not a fanatic about it 
 I don't know who played when and who does what like some guys are 
 I just like to watch 
 and and hopefully they win 
 That's about the extent of it
 I see 
 What school are you going to
 B Y U

 Great
 My mom's an L V N
 Yeah 
 So what are you planning to go into 
 Do you want to be an R N 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Try that 
 That's what my mom does labor and delivery
 Yeah 
 she loves it 
 She she really enjoys
 No 
 she's a nurse in San Antonio
 but she's been she's been working a on a late shift 
 She works the I guess the graveyard's what you'd call it
 She works the graveyard shift 
 And she's worked that for years when I was small
 I guess probably going on twenty years now
 And she really enjoys it 
 She likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night 
 and and she's she just started a new job at a different hospital closer to where she lives
 and she's really enjoying herself 
 She really likes it
 Well good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree
 Hope you'll like it
 Do you plan on staying in in the Dallas area

 Yeah 
 I think Texas San Antonio in particular has got a large base of hospitals 
 I don't know about Dallas 
 I think Dallas is pretty scattered
 No 
 I'm I'm in Dallas
 but I'm originally from San Antonio
 and they've got large medical center down there 
 They've got the U T Health Science Center out there also
 So if ever wanted you know pursue anything more than your nursing degree that that'd be the place to do it
 great
 Great
 Well like I said good luck to you

 well take care 
 and maybe we'll meet up again some time
 Okay
