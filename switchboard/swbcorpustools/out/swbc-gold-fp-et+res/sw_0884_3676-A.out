 What kind of movies have you been seeing lately
 it's an excellent movie
 SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
 What was that anyway 
 Okay
 Uh-huh 
 Let's see 
 who was in FISHER KING 
 That was Robin Williams 
 and and I can't the last name
 we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately 
 we really enjoyed DEAD POETS' SOCIETY
 several years back one we saw we saw we really really enjoyed was ORDINARY PEOPLE with Timothy Hutton and Mary Tyler Moore 
 and who played the father anyway
 excellent movie
 Yes 
 we have
 we loved it
 I know what you mean 
 I know what you mean
 Yeah 
 I'm pretty impressed with stuff he's done 
 he made kind of an odd sounding ROBIN HOOD 
 but you know basic thick western U S accent for a ROBIN HOOD just doesn't seem to fit
 no 
 It's a good movie
 Well they did a real good job with it
 they didn't try to make him super human or you know invincible 
 They just just 
 he worked hard at it 
 No 
 I haven't not an opportunity to see that 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It sounds kind of like one we saw at home here on the rented it CLARA'S HEART
 Whoopi Goldberg
 And she played a 
 the 
 she's a housekeeper
 Yeah 
 she's a housekeeper 
 she She was a now I can't say it a Haitian 
 Anyway she she seemed to be that sort of person that seems half crazy 
 but then again she's got a whole lot on the ball 
 and the movie had the whole lot of philosophical content more than more than you know 
 it wasn't a mystery 
 it wasn't you know blood and guts and violence and and car chases type thing 
 It was just a good movie
 A KISS BEFORE DYING
 And 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable that's still worth watching
 okay
