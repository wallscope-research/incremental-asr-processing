 Well I have a a a former exercise program 
 I'm a graduate student 
 and this semester I'll tell you what I it's been almost impossible for me to get you know back to regular exercise
 last summer I was a a swim instructor all summer and and life guard 
 so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming 
 and and since I worked at a recreation center I could you know use those facilities quite often 
 But 
 yeah
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 and there's and there's no jarring on the 
 Pardon
 Exactly yeah 
 flu- 
 yeah 
 fluid resistance
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 How about you
 yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Do you do you kind of think it's a chore 
 or do you enjoy it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I I used to I used to weigh two hundred fifteen pounds 
 and now I weigh only about one about one seventy-five 
 so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I when I first moved to college 
 and I had started weight lifting quite regularly 
 and so I got my weight down 
 and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now because you know when I'm not fat like I used to be I don't worry about it 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Although lately I have noticed you know even if I gain like two pounds I start I start feeling it 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 there are 
 I'm living in a dorm right now 
 and so right downstairs there's a facility 
 And I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where all you know all we have to do is is run down there 
 and I really do if I have the time to
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 I really do because I like to get you know get off alone and just do that for a while 
 but that's hard you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Exactly
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 yeah
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 ready to go another twelve hours
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly
 Uh-huh 
 I stopped eating meat about must have been eight months ago
 Uh-huh 
 completely 
 any kind of meat 
 or and I and I really feel a lot better now
 Yeah 
 it really does
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 that's it that's about where almost all of the fat comes from
 and so I found that really helps
 Yeah 
 I eat that 
 I think I've eaten fish like twice since 
 I used to eat a lot of fish too 
 but I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens
 Yeah 
 and I like it
 I don't know if I'm that brave yet 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Okay 
 yeah 
 it sounds good
 Well good luck to you there in Idaho
 Well I'm in graduate school now 
 I I I kind of feel like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it is 
 Well it's good talking
 Pardon
 I'm studying speech pathology
