 that's the first I've ever heard of it 
 I haven't heard of it anything too much about it 
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah 
 I 
 the 
 my first impression was it would be v- very good 
 I think it would be good for people to serve 
 but I don't know if it should be an option 
 It would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the Depression or coming out of the Depression available for kids 
 And I think there are some available now where they are able to work 
 but making it a mandatory thing kind of 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 It seems like you'd have a lot more conscie- conscientious objectors if they had that choice
 Yeah 
 you know I'd I'd much rather work in a hospital than than to go war 
 and I'm sure most young men and women would 
 And so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well that makes sense 
 And then you run into again to the bureaucracy in running it 
 You know how you going to cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then
 so 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Plus the training involved
 Yeah 
 that would be expensive in most cases
 Because 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I know in 
 I personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught Christianity in Japan
 And I was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me 
 It taught me not to be so self-centered and it you know to think of others
 But I don't know if I was doing it in different situation you know not a really religious background if if I would get a lot out of it 
 You know I think I did because it you know it emphasized that sort of thing 
 You know a lot of self evaluation
 Right
 Right 
 And that I'm sure that would make a big difference too 
 You know you've got 
 well like I say I know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth like teenagers to go and do work in the national parks and work in neighborhoods to do clean up and that sort of thing 
 But I don't know what organization it's under 
 I don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private charity that's put it together 
 But I know that that helps a lot with training and a lot of 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 how much benefit it'll do them in the long run
 Right 
 especially in you know if you take a a child that's from the inner city and then put them in the a middle of a park 
 if they go back to the inner city they may not see trees for a while much less be able to take care of them 
 So that's yeah so that may not may not benefit them in the long run
 But 
 Okay 
 well thank you
 You too 
 bye-bye
