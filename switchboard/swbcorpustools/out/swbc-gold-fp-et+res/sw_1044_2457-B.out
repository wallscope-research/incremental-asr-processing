 Yeah
 boy
 Yeah
 I've been trying to put weed spray on the lawn for the whole week 
 and you can't put it on if it's suppose to rain within forty-eight hours
 and so I keep hearing the forecast it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain 
 but it really hasn't rained 
 I know
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well I get tired with the ki- 
 I have two ki- preschoolers a three year old and a two year old
 and if it's not nice and they can't go out it's really the pits 
 But I appreciate it when they can at least go play in the backyard for an hour or something you know
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well my three and half year old he really wants to have the pool out in the backyard you know any day 
 all Winter long he's been wanting a pool in the backyard 
 So I'm hoping you know that 
 it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being Winter to you know muggy and hot 
 and it's just you never really have like nice cool sixty-five or seventy degree weather with sunshine you know 
 I really miss that 
 I'm from Chicago originally 
 and I miss the seasons that you know that we used to get up there that you just don't have down here
 Yeah
 Oh 
 really
 yeah
 It's pretty hot here during the Summer gosh
 Do have air conditioning in your car 
 or 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I know my husband doesn't have air conditioning in his car and he when he comes home from work you know during the Summer he's just wa- he feels like he's burning like he's been baking for an hour 
 Gosh 
 Yeah
 What I hate is 
 I hate having to water so much around here you know 
 we never used to have to water our lawns
 you know in Chicago it was always enough rain here and there
 so here if you don't water it just looks awful
 I just hate to spend the money just going down the drain and watering grass you know
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 we have a dog too 
 so that adds to it you know traipse in and out with whatever the weather is like out there 
 so 
 yeah 
 because Houston was really hurricane alley wasn't it
 weren't there a lot of hurricanes there
 boy
 Yeah 
 that would be 
 Gosh
 Keep the weather radio close by and stuff like that
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 really every time I store batteries I wind up going to use them and they're dead 
 they've been stored so long
 boy
 Well now this is a little bit of relief although they still have warnings all the time around here for you know tornado season hurricanes and stuff 
 so I 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well I've been worried about mostly with having little kids now with taking them out in the Summer and getting them burnt up 
 I have to keep the sun screen on them just constantly when they go outside because they say it's just so dangerous for little ones to get a bad sunburn
 so 
 Yeah
 a hundred and ten degrees 
 and 
 And I can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that 
 I just don't even want to go out you know of the house to get the mail even 
 leave me in the air conditioning
 We had our air conditioning broke break last last Summer 
 The switch got something wrong with the switch 
 and we had to call somebody out to fix it because I couldn't take it more than a few hours without it on
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's really nice 
 I hate having to leave the house clo- you know closed up all the time
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well have you been here during the real heavy heavy rains 
 I can't remember what time of year 
 I think it's usually this time of year when we get some just torrential down pours
 Gosh
 flooding
 Our neighbors had flooding so badly it was like a foot deep in their house last year
 They had to replace all their carpeting and everything 
 it was miserable
 Yeah 
 That would not be fun
 Uh-huh
 really
 gosh 
 no kidding 
 Talk about asking for trouble 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Okay 
 well have a good day
 Thanks 
 Bye-bye
