 Kate what kind of where do you like to eat out
 Yes
 Do you 
 Have you tried Mother Mesquites
 That's at Skillman and L B J
 there is 
 it's where Skillman curves into Forest Lane
 and it's real good Mexican food 
 Another real good one is Rafael's down on McKinney Avenue
 They're both very good
 Uh-huh
 Chains 
 uh-huh
 El Chico's or El Fenix one 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Well I like Tia's better than I do El Chico's or El Fenix
 much better 
 Mother Mesquite's is one of our favorites 
 but then fajitas are one of my 
 I like it better than just about anything
 and they make very good fajitas there in their own homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful
 Especially with butter and honey on them 
 Yes 
 yes 
 so do I
 Well what else do you like
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 now I haven't eaten there 
 Have you eaten there
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I we like for the cajun the spicy we like Atchafalaya's out on Belt Line in Addison
 and it's a good restaurant
 And fish for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either Vincent's there in Plano or I believe it's a Rusty Scupper over on Dallas Parkway in Addison which is absolutely wonderful
 The service is great 
 They have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want
 and the the atmosphere is wonderful too 
 If you want a really special night out and fish food that's a good place to go
 Fast food well I can understand that 
 *[[two utts]] I can remember when our children were small
 We lived in the Chicago area at the time 
 and we had a lot of McDonalds when they were first coming out
 I can't look a McDonalds in the face now
 Well Taco Bueno's good 
 And cheap 
 and cheap
 Yes 
 yes
 yes 
 Sounds like my grandchildren
 yes
 Well it's just my husband and I 
 and it's either T V dinners at home or we go out to eat
 And I would much rather go out to eat than T V dinners 
 no 
 no
 I like breakfast out
 I like the IHOP there in Plano
 Oh
 now that's surprising because normally they're just they're real good
 I like because they they're even if they're crowded they're fast service you know
 don't have to wait forever for a table
 And we also like Owens country sausa- 
 yeah
 yeah 
 We think it's good
 Uh-huh 
 It's good
 Yes 
 yes
 And we like Applebee's
 Yeah 
 it it's fun 
 I like your up there in Plano that Country Steak House
 Have you tried it
 We like it because it's fairly reasonable 
 and they have we go for the salad bar
