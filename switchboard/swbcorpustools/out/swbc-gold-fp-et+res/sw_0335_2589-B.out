 The public school systems well everybody's kno- has known they've needed renovation for years but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it
 The first direction that I can see I wish I would love to see them go with 
 Kids learn at different rates 
 and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together 
 You'd learn at this rate 
 and that's the only way it's going to happen
 You've got some kids that'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it 
 and the re- the other fifty-seven minutes you've been talking about a subject you've bored them
 The educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person
 Out of each child
 Some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff 
 Other kids are going to be really into math 
 some are really going to be heavy into reading
 Instead of pushing the scales too far either direction it's great to be well rounded and hav- be exposed to all this stuff
 But why not hit the points the kid's really interested in 
 Because if he's interested he's going to study it 
 and he's going to learn it 
 and he's going to remember it
 They need exposure to every subject 
 They don't need to be masters of it
 Everything I learned about ancient Rome ha- has not helped me anywhere in my adult life
 What what type of history class is it that you're having to take
 Well the early ones they could actually combine two two levels of it the one from seventeen hundred til say the end of the Civil War 
 Combine that into one And then from eighteen sixty-five to present 
 and make that your second step because To a point to a point the bottom you know the early parts of it you're giving the foundations of the nation 
 and but even then they're skimming over 
 they're very tri- almost trivial with it
 You know if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter there's they make all these people out to be 
 they were great men 
 and they're the father of the country and all this 
 He had just as much dirt on him as anybody else
 If not more 
 The man was not a saint
 If if the isolation concept really works that good why are our prisons overcrowded
 Th- the as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that lev- the public school system I want to see changed too 
 When I was br- brought up if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough you were going to get spanked
 Well then the extreme came in 
 and now we can no longer spank them 
 so we now isolate them
 Okay 
 we've swung the pendulum both ways 
 Let's find a middle ground 
 Instead of there has to be some sort of discipline 
 and there has to be some sort of punishment Short of physically isolating the child and short of physically hitting the child
 Let's put him into a situation where okay you crossed the line you broke the rule you're going to have to pay for it
 But it's going to tax you physically
 Have th- in- instead ha- have them pick up around the school yard have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school yar- Do something to beautify the school property
 But you cut you know 
 the the kid's having to give up his quote play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong
 But he's seeing something constructive come out of it
 I think that not only applies inside the public school system but in society itself 
 We've been too long there's been too much negative reinforcement 
 How much da- like the caught being good slips 
 How about just the John Q citizen out there on the street
 I m- m- most wholeheartedly agree
 there's a point of over kill 
 but somewhere in you've got to find an even line
 Need that shock effect where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked
