 Well good afternoon to you Mary 
 First let me ask you what's what's the weather like up there to begin with
 That sounds more like our winter weather down here
 
 Well you know I bet that's what we that storm we had last night
 we had a frog strangler go [ sw- + sweeping through here yesterday and last night 
 And we're expecting another one tonight
 it was raining so hard you could swim down the street
 Uh-huh
 Well it's probably on its way up there 
 It was heading north
 Well it was nice today
 in between the thunder showers 
 yes
 Well you know what they say about the weather here in Texas
 If you if you don't like it wait five minutes it'll change
 Uh-huh 
 W- 
 Uh-huh 
 Well tell me is is it normally that cold up there in in the Spring
 You're kidding
 You are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open
 Um-hum
 Oh 
 Mother Macree 
 No 
 I should say not 
 Well I I sincerely hope that you don't have that terrible storm we had
 I hope it doesn't reach you up there
 Well I 
 let's hope it 
 well i- if it's the same as what we had at least it'll be warmer
 Yeah 
 boy 
 the that whew that would be tear disastrous If you had that rain storm and freezing weather
 Oh
 Uh-huh

 Uh-huh 
 Well I heard on the news this morning that one of our local schools lost the roof of their gymnasium
 And they suspected may have been a tornado
 But thank God for small favors the 
 what do they call them The the the marching band or something
 had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before
 and how
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 Well during the winter 
 yes 
 we do 
 we've had well past four or five years I guess at least one day during the year when just everything would just close down because we'd have freezing rain
 And of course people down here they just don't know how to handle themselves 
 and 
 Well not only that 
 but we're we're ee- don't have the equipment to handle it either
 they go out there 
 and the 
 well all you can do with with freezing rain of course is spr- spread sand on the ice
 And but you know we don't even have vehicles that will do that
 They they have to get a truck of sand and four or five laborers up there just spreading it by hand *[[needs slash]] Well and then to make matters worse it destroys your vehicles too
 Yeah 
 they well we they do that down here too 
 They mix the salt in with the sand
