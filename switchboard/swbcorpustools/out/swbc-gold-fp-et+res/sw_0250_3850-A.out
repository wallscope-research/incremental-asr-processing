 Okay
 I like watching COLOMBO and MATLOCK and QUANTUM LEAP 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that one was 
 What about 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 I well I haven't seen either of those 
 Huh-uh
 I also like to watch STAR TREK 
 but it's on so late here that I don't always get to see it 
 I haven't seen any of the movies because I just barely just like in the last year or so got interested in it 
 and they're you know already out with number six by now 
 but So I haven't seen any of the movies yet 
 but I 
 No
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I've seen quite a few of the older ones 
 I haven't seen really the new generation that much
 Is there one you prefer better the older one or the youn- the newer one
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I do too 
 I have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot 
 he almost hates the new ones 
 Yeah 
 because he he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something 
 but I don't 
 I think 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 sure 
 Well let's see 
 I like to watch COLOMBO because it's like a mystery thing
 That's sort of how Matlock is 
 but COLOMBO is way tricky 
 he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them
 Well did you see the one 
 
 yeah 
 there's like one on 
 well we see it Thursdays at seven 
 and it was 
 this last time it was about this movie director 
 did you hap- 
 did you see that 
 Really 
 I guess I nev- 
 
 I guess I've I haven't seen it before 
 Yeah
 yeah 
 on the set or something
 Yeah 
 it was 
 But yeah 
 I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those mystery things
 But there's no never anything good on Saturdays though 
 I don't think so 
 Well STAR TREK'S on at five 
 but I'm never home 
 so 
 Oh
 I've heard of it a lot 
 I've heard of 
 a lot of people somehow or something 
 They'll say so and so from TWIN PEAKS or something you know
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 did they end the whole series
 Oh
 Oh
 another show I like to watch is MASH
