 Yeah 
 is that it
 Okay 
 well we I guess we have to talk about magazines 
 and what what 
 Well I subscribe to P- well I did subscribe to PEOPLE for a long time 
 I do you know 
 I enjoy PEOPLE 
 And now I'm I subscribe to LADIES HOME JOURNAL
 Uh-huh
 Okay 
 are you interested in in computers
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 well that that would be one of my peeves 
 My pet peeves with magazines the woman's magazines especially 
 it's it's really geared to 
 all they have 
 you have too many recipes first of all 
 I just don't you know 
 that's what I don't like about LADIES HOME JOURNAL magazines 
 Too many recipes too many can this marriage with saved nonsense 
 I you know I like to read articles about things that matter 
 Well of course PEOPLE magazine is not you know one of your your more intellectual magazines 
 but it's nice light reading 
 You know if I want something intellectual I usually read a book
 Well that's true 
 yeah 
 they did
 Yeah
 Well is REDBOOK still in existence 
 I don't know if they're if they're around anymore
 Yeah
 Well I'll tell you the only reason I bought the I subscribe to the JOURNAL is because of 
 which I think it was either 
 yeah 
 it was Publisher's Clearinghouse 
 They told me you know if I didn't subscribe they were going to take me off their their winning you know their list 
 So 
 Yeah 
 my last my last chance to win ten million dollars 
 so I figured hey look For twelve dollars you know
 That's it
 yeah 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well I don't know 
 I just think you know it's It's light reading 
 You know you don't have well you don't have to concentrate you know you know
 It's entertaining you know 
 and that's 
 I just I enjoy it 
 I you know I 
 Well that ENTERTAINMENT is is very 
 wasn't that similar isn't it similar to to the TV GUIDE
 uh-huh
 I see
 uh-huh
 Oh
 Right 
 right
 Well I'll tell you since I've been getting the JOURNAL like maybe maybe I'll read two maybe three 
 if I read three articles in in you know one of the JOURNALs I figure you know I did really well
 Because there's just nothing in there that interests me 
 I don't you know I don't I'm not into you know recipes 
 and 
 See now and I'm not into crafts 
 so you know that that eliminates like three quarters of the magazine You know
 Well I just got the new issue 
 they have Bette Midler on the cover 
 so that should be one article that I'll read anyway
