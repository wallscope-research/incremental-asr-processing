 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Right
 You have a lot of discipline 
 They make it really easy for people to to get credit cards especially college students
 I have two daughters who who both are in college 
 or in fact one has finished now 
 But they both have a lot of credit cards
 Uh-huh
 right 
 And then they they give you the credit limit 
 and then you're always s- seemingly up to that limit 
 Now I have quite a few credit cards that I'm always almost up to the limit on most of them 
 And that's that's how a lot of people get into trouble
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well you have a lot of discipline 
 I I'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine 
 I I've I've paid off about four credit cards this year
 And but still I have some that are are up to the limit 
 And especially the Visa Card that you can go and get cash on 
 And it seems like every time I'm short of cash I just go get get it from Visa
 Uh-huh
 
 Well you can go in a bank and just hand them the Visa Card and say "I want a cash advance" 
 Or if they've sent you a a number that you can use You know a a personal identification number that you can use in the impact machines or whatever you you can do that 
 Because I have one that I don't have a pin number for 
 You know sometimes you have to ask them for that
 And then I have one that just gave me the pin number automatically
 Uh-huh
 Right
 wow 
 Well they they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time 
 Ev- ev- everybody in the world will offer you a a credit card
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Well you know the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that I think we we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible 
 That's that's why I've I've really started to try to to pay off mine and get out of debt Because we never know when we might you know get laid off or something 
 Especially me 
 I work for Texas Instruments 
 and they've had had a lot of of you know layoffs lately
 You do
 Where are you
 Johnson City 
 uh-huh 
 I know they're selling out somebody in Colorado Springs
 Yeah
 It it certainly is 
 I've I have worked on a part part time job where I was a collector For a jewelry company 
 People that 
 they just had this jewelry account 
 It was Zales jewelry in fact 
 And a whole bunch of peop- 
 they have about a thousand collectors I guess
 And there's just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item
 and then they they just can't pay for it 
 Something something happens 
 you know and you hear so many stories listening to them Like you know they lost their job 
 or they they've signed for a friend 
 You know they got it in their name 
 but they got it for a friend 
 and then the friend wouldn't pay them 
 and now they're stuck with the bill 
 and it's ruining their credit 
 and you really have to watch it this you know 
 Because 
 Yeah 
 Because every every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau you know Automatically mo- most of them do
 Yeah 
 And if you if you're 
 it's bad because if you you know your bill is due on the fifteenth then i- y- y- y- you- you're not past due until the fifteenth of the next month
 But you know if you if you pay one day after that fifteenth you're not one day late 
 you're thirty days late
 Right
 right 
 A- a- 
 and anyway we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of 
 Uh-huh 
 Well you know you you can do that 
 I believe it costs about ten dollars
 yeah 
 It is 
 it is 
 You might even find somebody's been reporting on you 
 and you didn't even know it 
 You know you you might think you're paying something on time 
 or and you by that day 
 and you're thir- thirty days is not real bad though anyway <> If you've got a charge off on your credit report or something like that 
 That's when it really gets bad 
 Or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days you know And things like that 
 Uh-huh
 Do they charge a lot of interest on that card
 I don't 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well always watch out for s- anybody who bills you out of Atlanta Georgia 
 Or there's a couple of other places that are able to charge us like twenty-one and twenty-two percent interest 
 I know I had a charge with Spiegel 
 and I hadn't read the terms of the credit agreement really
 And when I did I you know I realized that that it just looked seemed like I was never paying the balance off you know 
 And I looked at the credit card agreement one day 
 and it was like twenty-three percent interest
 And that's the one bill that I hurry up hurried and paid up
 And and I've always watched it since then 
 You really have to watch those interest rates 
 
 That's true
 So anyway they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent I think in in Texas 
 But there there are a couple of states that can 
 And one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of Atlanta Atlanta Georgia
 Well
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Oh
 Wow
 I wonder if they
