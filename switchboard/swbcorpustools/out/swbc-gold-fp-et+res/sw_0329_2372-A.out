 Well how about you 
 Do you use P Cs
 Yeah 
 You and me both
 Huh-uh
 Yeah 
 And so I like the I B M P C personally
 But that's pretty much everything I've worked with 
 and I've become so accustomed to it that it's second nature
 What do you use
 Yeah
 huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 okay
 okay 
 So we we use it's an I B M P S two also
 And you know every now and then the file gets so big that you know it moves slower than I'd like
 but I I do mainly graphic work on it And a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it
 And I don't know 
 I just I enjoy working with them
 There's so many capabilities out there 
 the things you can do are endless
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 We have one at home 
 but I just don't find the time that I can use it
 Yes
 Huh-uh
 One of the reasons why I got mine was before I went on maternity leave 
 they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because I am pretty much the like you said the guru in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is
 and so they didn't know how it was going to work 
 they knew they were going to have to get a modem so that we could in the decks machine so that we could in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so
 But you know it's it's almost like we could become too dependent on them
 And I we use a lot of free lance
 And that's pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things
 And it 
 compared to the way the things have upgraded Have really 
 what's the word I'm looking for 
 I'm just totally drawing a blank 
 But the way things have changed over the years with the P C and the different programs is just great 
 It's remarkable the things we can do now and compared to you know a few years Just the power 
 I'm I'm trying to get an updated machine 
 Mine is just putting along 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Huh-uh
 now that's awful
 Huh-uh
 Okay
 okay
 Right
 yes
 Right 
 The copy that you can with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer
 And it's just so 
 the budget restraints and things like that it's makes it difficult 
 and 
 Huh-uh
 huh-uh
 And we got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars
 Yeah 
 I don't remember what kind they were 
 but we do a lot of transparencies
 Sometimes the color would take too long to plot out
 So they just want black and white which see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick Because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it
 But it 
 No 
 huh-uh 
 If it was a customer presentation then that would be different
 We would want to razzle-dazzle a bit 
 But it's 
 yeah 
 We have one in the office 
 and if we want well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to change it put it on a disc And carry it over to there and see if they're not using the printer
 Right 
 And wait for an opportunity to use it
 Huh-uh
 I know 
 I know 
 I understand
 Huh-uh
 huh-uh
 Right
 So how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind the times in technology
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Right
 We find it hard to believe sometimes hard to understand when we work for a computer company and how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated That's obsolete 
 and the guys that some of the guys that run this place are very tight 
 and it's like Well why do we need this 
 can't you do that with you know what we have 
 and when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good
