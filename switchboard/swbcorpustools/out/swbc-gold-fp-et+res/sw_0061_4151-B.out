 That's a good question 
 there would be a point there was a point where I would have said no that no one would deserve to die for for a crime that he committed 
 But since I've become a parent and since I've seen things like Jeffrey Dahlmer I really have to question that 
 I really I I can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people
 And try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment 
 
 it's a it's a question of your your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response
 a- and that was the thing that killed Dukakis back four years ago when someone asked him a similar question 
 and he he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion a gut level reaction 
 And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level 
 you know whether it be a biblical force you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic or just some sort of anger at putting peop- putting murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life while we foot the bill
 I think people are are working at that from more of a a gut reaction than a a reason humane one
 That's true
 th- the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent 
 and I really don't agree with that 
 I don't think anyone who would commit a a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say well I was about to kill and dismember this person 
 but if they catch me they're going to kill me 
 so I better not do it 
 I I just don't think that that it works that way
 Uh-huh
 Well I I don't know if that would really work that way or not 
 there's a lot of violence
