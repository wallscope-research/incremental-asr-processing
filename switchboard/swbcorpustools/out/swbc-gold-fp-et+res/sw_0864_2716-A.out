 Okay 
 do you have any ideas on universal health insurance 
 Do you have any strong opinions
 You do 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I feel like there should be some kind of coverage made 
 but I I'm really leery of a kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan because I just feel like everything that the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly 
 and it is going to be about six times more expensive
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 and they have that in England too 
 but I think that it's a pretty poor 
 they get a lot lower quality care than we do 
 Now I know some people don't agree with me 
 but I know you have to wait real long time to get for certain surgeries that aren't emergency 
 and you don't have the kind of choices that we have here
 And I've worked a lot in doctor's offices and hospitals 
 and I really don't want to give up having those choices
 I think 
 there is a night and day difference between good doctors and bad doctors and good hospitals and bad doc- hospitals
 And in England at least at the time when I was familiar with it about ten years ago they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was going to be
 No 
 no 
 I mean that
 Yeah
 It's getting worse 
 isn't it
 Yeah 
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 That's exactly the problem 
 there's just so many such variation 
 and it's 
 but see I guess what they had in England and I guess in Canada is socialized medicine
 So maybe that's like the extreme of it 
 Do you think
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Right 
 Really want to 
 Right 
 Right 
 or that 
 yeah 
 exactly 
 or people also get the feeling that well jeez you know you don't have to worry about you have a lot of job security there 
 and it's more of seniority I would imagine kind of thing instead of having a skill or or whatever to advance
 so you don't necessarily get the kind of quality control or the kind of 
 I don't know
 I think we have to have something 
 We really do
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I know 
 I I don't know 
 I 
 having worked in doctor's offices and stuff I see it from a physician's point of view 
 And I I think the problem with the skyrocketing cost right now is the insurance companies because I don't see doctors getting real rich 
 and I think hospitals do make money but not nearly as much as insurance companies
 I think they are really making a killing and nobody is talking about it 
 Nobody's 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 right
 Their mistakes are made
 Right
 Sure
 Yeah
 So yeah 
 I think that's the legal part of it coming into it to
 I wonder if we should have a limit on how much people can sue for
 Or or I don't know because then that's where the insurance company 
 then if people weren't having to spend these huge amounts of money on getting insurance coverage You know 
 Yeah 
 Are you
 Okay
 At where
 okay 
 Uh-huh 
 I 
 what 
 I'm in Texas 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 great
 Yeah
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 no
 That that that can't be legal
 my gosh 
 How can they how can they make you pay for insurance coverage
 How how does it keep the cost down
 so they just use the money for something else besides your insurance policy
 Okay ] Okay 
 So you're subsidizing the hospital
 Uh-huh 
 good
 You are you are 
 I know 
 And see that's the thing 
 that is the thing 
 now that I'm in my thirties now and I have three kids 
 and I'm very liberal 
 I'm extremely liberal 
 and I 
 but now I just in the last couple of years I have gotten to the point where I am saying I just cannot afford to pay anymore to help people out 
 I I want to keep helping people out 
 but I need for the government or the agencies to find a way to do it on the amount of money you know that I can afford
 I just can't afford anymore
 It's it's just outrageously 
 It's just starting to get me angry 
 and for the first time in my life I am starting to feel like I I 
 Well I guess it has to do with a lot of the stuff that I find out I am paying for now You know
 if I can't afford to have some kind of volun- optional operation for myself 
 Because our our medical coverage has gotten increasingly worse over let's see the past five years to the point now where even if we need surgery our insurance only covers eighty percent of it
 And right 
 and so no matter what happens to me if I get in a car accident this afternoon I have no way of you know no way of being able to afford the outrageous medical costs because my insurance is now only eighty percent of whatever it's going to be 
 And so on top of that then what if I what if we decide to have universal health insurance 
 I'm subsidizing 
 And what if they are lucky enough to get into a doctor and a program that's going to say Okay well you really need to have those varicose veins fixed or your teeth fixed or something like that
 And I am paying for it 
 You know stuff like that has happened with education and with other things that you hear about 
 and it's just Wait a minute 
 You know my kids aren't getting that 
 How come their their kids are getting that
 And I know it's only in a few cases 
 and I don't want them to to cut funding for welfare programs or anything 
 I don't want them to do that because I know a lot of people they live right on the edge 
 and they need that
 But but 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Well yeah 
 that's 
 and it's it's funny because a couple of years ago I heard a quote from Winston Churchill 
 Let's see if I can remember it 
 anybody who's not a liberal in his twenties has no heart 
 and a person who is not a conservative in his fifties has no brain 
 It was something like that 
 Yeah 
 and I don't know 
 I guess that's what's happening to me 
 but I I think it's just starting 
 it's it's 
 I I don't know maybe other people 
 I 
 do you think it's a sign of the times that people are starting to say All right we really mean it no more taxes 
 or maybe this is just my own personal 
 Yeah 
 No 
 no income tax
 Yeah
 Oh
 Oh
 Wow
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 but I tell you we have incredible property taxes down here
 Yeah 
 and we don't have the services either that other states have
