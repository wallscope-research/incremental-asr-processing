 Yes
 yes 
 we own one
 its an Emerson eighty eighty-six two low density floppy drives and no hard drive yet 
 But you know it's it comes in mighty handy
 yeah 
 a big chunk of it's word processing 
 We're also taking programming classes 
 and so there's a fair amount of programming getting done on it 
 But the 
 right now we got a project going where we're trying to put all my wife's stray recipes on the disk
 it came with a menus program 
 but that doesn't 
 it it basi- 
 both 
 mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive
 and hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured
 Eighty eighty-six
 Which 
 impoverished college student 
 This one went on a credit card 
 and we got a way out while to pay it off yet 
 So it's *[[ B's next turn is not a continuation of this ]] that's sounds nice
 *[[slash error]] E D P
 Okay 
 that sounds like fun job
 Yes
 Computer engineering
 Well computer engineering technology which all I can understand is it's a slightly more hands on version of computer engineering 
 But I've got a ways to go yet 
 So far most of what I've done is getting gotten core classes out of the way
 taken some electronics classes and one class in with computer logic
 yes 
 I enjoy it myself 
 The lab for that computer logic class was a lot of fun
 Yeah 
 we got to hook up a few counters and deco- encoders 
 Yeah
 I've not had a chance to work with it although my data structures teacher was telling us something about how fuz- fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it
 Now how you'd implement that software wise or mechanically I don't know 
 but it sounds like a very impressive piece of piece of work
 Yes
 In the fuzzy logic direction
 Yeah
 Entering bad information of one sort or another 
 and 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 well what the computer what the C E T program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from 
 you get programming a fair amount of programming 
 you get hardware 
 you get more or less you get basic electronics courses that deal with you know not only the digital circuitry but you know power supplies and and just the whole gambit but mostly towards computer electronics 
 So the idea is that you can go in a variety of direction from C E T major 
 but I sa- I have more with the hardware than I do with the software 
 so yeah 
 I pretty much plan on so far I'm planning to go in the engineering direction
