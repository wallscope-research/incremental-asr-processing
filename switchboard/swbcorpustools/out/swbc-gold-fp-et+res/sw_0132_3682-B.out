 Okay 
 what kind of foods would you have
 I do too 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 you can't enjoy it
 Right
 That's that's what 
 I like doing things like making lasagna just because I can have it ready and baking in the oven 
 it's 
 everybody just says how wonderful it is 
 and it's it's like yes 
 I 
 That's one of those things I got famous for in college 
 People would come and say could y- would you come over and make lasagna for me 
 It's like well I can't really give you a recipe 
 I can I can just do it 
 I like doing that kind of stuff
 And it's it's fun 
 in fact that's what we had for a Christmas party last week
 We just had a bunch of people over 
 and we had we did lasagna and garlic bread and yummy
 I do too in fact 
 Oh
 good
 actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it's a real easy is just baked potato dinners
 And have you know like three or four couples come over 
 and I'll do the potatoes and you know like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like
 and it turns out great because you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and you know bacon and all that good stuff
 But it's it's inexpensive
 plus it's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it 
 and you got a great dinner
 It's it's real easy 
 I like doing that part
 I'm in favor of very little clean up very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games 
 and it's 
 we invariably end up at my house since I've got two kids
 And that it's it's fine because then I can just say Okay fine 
 you bring this 
 you bring this 
 you bring this 
 we're done
 And it's pretty cool
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Oh
 I love it 
 
 Over the uncooked rice
 Oh
 how neat
 
 Now I've done it with where you put you cook the ri- well I guess you probably could do it same way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a little bit of white wine in it
 And every once in a while I'll put in I'll slice white grapes 
 and I'll put in there 
 and that's just because I'm not a real big wine person 
 but I like it 
 it adds something to the chicken
 And then just bake it 
 and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice
 Yeah 
 It's that was one of the first things I made for my husband because I was like 
 yeah
 I could actually find something I could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of 
 yeah
 But then I hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice
 So just like in a thirteen by nine pan
 
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I I use that for br- for rice 
 and for when I cook pasta or something I'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor
 Now that would be good
 How long do you have to bake it
 I do I do microwave too a lot 
 How long would it be how long would it be in the microwave
 okay
 Okay
 Do you just brown the chicken to get it colored
 or do you go ahead and let it cook through
 
 this is a beneficial call 
 I like this 
 Yeah 
 but that one's an easy one 
 It's like just put in 
 a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the with the soup and the wine
 put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that you know What ever however much effort you feel like putting into it
 But it it makes a great 
 I've got a two year old and a four year old 
 and they love it
 And because my daughter calls it her gravy 
 and she thinks it's wonderful 
 my good you're a picky eater if I can get you to
