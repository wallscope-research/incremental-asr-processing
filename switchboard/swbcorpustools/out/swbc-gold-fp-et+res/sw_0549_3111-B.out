 Well Hal what's what's crime like in Dallas
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 in Baltimore we have similar 
 I live on the outskirts of Baltimore 
 and we live right outside the city 
 and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people though I'm in graduate school 
 I live here because it's close to the university
 But you know we have 
 it it's really funny 
 the only crime we really see is just the kids being malicious
 You know and I think most of that is because their parents aren't around 
 That make sense
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 something like that 
 No one's you know 
 or or fathers are just missing you know 
 so there's no no consistency there in the home or whatever 
 There's no one to tell them what's right and what's wrong you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh <> 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that's we're about the same in Baltimore 
 Though Washington I think is close by 
 and you know they experience a lot more
 I think they definitely have more problems that in in the area 
 What what do you think can prevent crime
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I I think I agree with you there
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I think they the drug culture definitely has is one of the main problems 
 Yeah 
 our our mayor in Baltimore is one of the people that goes on national television and says they should legalize drugs *[[slash error]] Because it would eliminate the the violence and the the under- the the market I guess the the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it
 *[[sv]] That make sense 
 He's one of the big proponents of that 
 He gets on national television and and says that you know 
 So it's 
 and he was a d- d- a District Attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming becoming mayor 
 So that's a really stran- 
 you know it's a different viewpoint 
 I 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 What happens if we lose worse
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 they have induced it themselves
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well I think you know they did that in Alaska That that actually Alaska just recently legalized marijuana
 *[[two utts]] But I never I never heard results or anything like that 
 so I never you know 
 plus that's such a that's not a true you know it really couldn't be a good test because Alaska's so different than every other part of the country
 You know so that but that was interesting you know 
 I I don't 
 crime is one of those things that's 
 I I don't know you know 
 the drug culture 
 the the you know 
 I I see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 That's true 
 We worked hard for everything 
 That's very true
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 That I think that the drunk driving has just actually just caught on 
 A- and I I I really 
 my father was hit by a drunk driver when I was in high school
 and that was a very that that was an awful three years afterwards You know of recovery and the difficulties and everything we did 
 and you know the guy went free because this was twelve years ago thirteen years ago 
 there was no 
 his father was even the police chief of the town
 So there was no repercussion at all You know other than insurance 
 but he was uninsured
 So our insurance paid for everything 
 but it was a very difficult time 
 and and then later this was actually funny my brother and I were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a a new car 
 and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it and broke all his windows and his lights and his dented it everywhere 
 and they came and questioned us
 You know and 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yep *[[slash error]] Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 very much so 
 Yeah 
 that those are some important points 
 Yeah 
 I 
 that's those are 
 Well see Maryland is one of the most 
 we just voted in gun control strong gun control here in the state of Maryland 
 I I think
