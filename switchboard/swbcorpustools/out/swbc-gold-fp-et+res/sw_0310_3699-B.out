 Yes
 We we it's a house we bought about two and a half years ago now
 Uh-huh
 First house
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So what do you think of of owning a home as opposed to to renting somebody else's
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Do you have is it a fairly large house
 that's pretty good size 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 It's tiny
 It's not much bigger 
 Actually we had an apartment two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is 
 So 
 Yeah 
 it's it's only like eleven hundred square feet
 Just one
 Yeah
 But it it all the rooms are small 
 but it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted And Use an extra one for an office which is handy
 I'd rather have have more rooms and less space in each one I guess Rather have lots of rooms and lot- lots of space 
 but that ends up costing me
 Well they're it's pretty typical it's a very very middle class neighborhood 
 lots of lots of young couples with you know usu- 
 I'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood that's their first homes
 and lots of kids and stuff 
 and so it it fits well in the neighborhood 
 It's it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood 
 but on the other hand it's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than I want
 Is is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood 
 or is it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 wow eight kids
 my gosh
 Ooh
 I'm sure with eight 
 gosh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 new ones they they tend to to be real tiny but that especially in newer neighborhoods 
 my my brother just built a new house 
 He lives in Wichita Kansas 
 and the the neighborhood actually fought him on it 
 because he he was the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood
 Now that's because he was he's doing a lot of it himself and you know for example landscaping and and lots of the other stuff 
 and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots in the neighborhood 
 but but they were they were pretty touchy on it 
 He was a little surprised
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Kind of depends on when they get in you know
 they have 
 it's gotten 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 oh
 Uh-huh
 
 Well see my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they they moved into a neighborhood and bought a a real nice stone house down in South Austin
 And and the what the builder apparently plans to do is they they do phase one 
 and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled codes and and and stuff 
 and then they come back in 
 and and then they sell
