 Okay 
 what do you like to cook
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That would be good for a dinner party that you know to cook that because you don't have to deal with eight different things coming out at once 
 Is that what you usually cook when you have a party
 Uh-huh
 Really 
 that sounds good
 fattening 
 we 
 it's funny that we're talking about this 
 we just had a dinner party 
 and we had 
 our senior pastor and his wife came over
 And I catered to their diet is the only thing though 
 so it wasn't something I really wanted to make 
 I really wanted to make red beans and rice and with you know sausage 
 because I'm from New Orleans originally
 And I was going to make that red beans and rice with the those Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff 
 and well there's salad 
 and then for desert I would I really wanted to make just brownies 
 or French donuts would have been good 
 but it's real hard to make them 
 They don't really come out like they do in New Orleans up here 
 I don't know why
 I don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe I have 
 but 
 that's what I want 
 That's what I like to make is just real neat stuff like that 
 but 
 Kind of like the Italian 
 it's really good 
 but instead I catered to their diet 
 so I made baked chicken in the crock pot 
 and it was good and everything 
 it had all the vegetables in it 
 but it seemed kind of boring compared 
 Right
 I find it changing the way that I eat but not the way I entertain 
 because I guess I guess I feel like if they're on a diet like that I'm going to you know honor that 
 but if it's just 
 another couple came over a couple weeks later 
 and I made 
 what did I make that night 
 I made a roast
 and I made 
 I can't believe this 
 my husband broke the coffee pot I just bought yesterday
 I can't believe that 
 Anyway but I asked 
 when Ricky and Carrie came over we made a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit
 And normally I don't eat we don't eat like that during the week because of the you know the calories and the fat in it
 But you know when we're having guests we just kind of say oh just do it 
 And I made blueberry cobbler 
 and we had extra crust with it
 it was so fattening
 But I don't think we gained any weight from it 
 so 
 Right 
 I made an apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over 
 and she didn't eat it
 But I did bake apples so that it would be not brownies you know 
 I figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies
 So I've read a good brownie recipe
 But anyway so I guess that's about what I did when I entertained
 So do you have anything else you want to say about it
 Okay 
 well it was nice talking to you
 Okay 
 bye
