 All right 
 do you have any friends that have children
 And what do they say about finding adequate child care
 I think that may be the key word
 Right
 Well we certainly found that to be true
 indeed we've 
 our children are now eleven and nine
 And we moved away from institutionalized child care if we can call those chain kind of things like that by that name And found that more creative avenues were the right answer for us
 at one point in time we've had au pairs by trading services with them
 and that worked for a while 
 but they were really adequate ones were really tough to find
 It takes that mixture of a very mature college student who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time and the interest to the children
 Well that's true
 and that's something that we're struggling with now
 yeah
 Much as other cultures disagree our lives don't revolve around our children
 Well it certainly is 
 if I can the other side of the coin for a moment
 It is such an honor and a thrill to be a parent that most of the time it's worth it
 Well I just have to be honest about it 
 It's not always worth it 
 There are those times when I think gee if I didn't have children I could be out playing bridge or golf
 Well we were lucky when our children were that age 
 and having lived in a community for a while and we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children
 And felt that that and feeling of safety
 And were leaving them small children
 But we also learned something from that experience as our children got older
 It's that care givers are not omniscient
 they are not all things to all people or all children
 The ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I have a nine year old that I would trade happily for a baby 
 you don't know what happens after they get in school
 yes 
 Now we have one takes piano lessons somewhere on one afternoon 
 and the other one of course can't do the same thing
 It has to be somewhere else 
 and no 
 it's not adequate to sit and wait
 No
 That just 
 that will not do
 Of course
 But we are helping you know
 We are being cooperative 
 what's wrong with you
 You don't understand this
 That's just the way their minds work 
 And it's almost everyday
 Well I've been finding out that I really am a nice person 
 hit for many years 
 because I didn't need it
 And now I need it
 Yeah 
 And it stays low a lot 
 Absolutely not
 one of them I would I would leave unsupervised any time any place any where
 the other one I wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes
 That's true
 What 
 one leads the other
 And 
 Of course
 You don't think you don't think that good prevails
 We we're having such fun 
 my wife and I were both only children
 And we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends
 Wrong
 Just make good friends
 Have enough 
 That's true
 Well what what's frightening is a parent to see things that that you don't really don't understand
 And then you don't really know what happened
 We gave up on one baby sitter because we came home one night and found pieces of ribbon you know hair ribbon tied in a chair Where obviously she had had
