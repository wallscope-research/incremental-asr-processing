 Well I it's doesn't seem like I get enough time to watch much T V 
 but the ones that are out now 
 I I've watched that SISTERS a couple of times 
 I think that's kind of a good show
 Haven't you
 I like that one 
 and I'm trying to think 
 I I don't even know if I have any other real regular ones that I watch
 How about you
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 I do like that
 Yeah 
 occasionally I'll see that one
 Do you
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I do 
 I kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately
 I've well I've been home with a 
 I have a baby 
 and and so I've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much 
 and so I'll I'll watch a soap occasionally
 Do you watch any of those
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 what what ones do you get into
 uh-huh
 Oh
 How funny 
 yeah
 I don't get into them that much
 When I'm home sometimes in the day I'll I'll watch them
 but yeah I was really trying to think 
 I don't even know if there's any other shows that I watch or else 
 I have a six year old 
 and I have a 
 he'll be a year old in January
 Well they do they watch it 
 My six year old's kind of 
 he's outgrown that one a little bit 
 but but I've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby 
 and he's kind of he's entertained by it
 So yes 
 I I do watch that one
 Yeah 
 well they're not entertained for too long with it 
 He's he's still too little 
 but yeah 
 I do turn that on
 And I I do like DONAHUE
 Sometimes I watch that 
 I think he has some interesting things on it
 that's on at let's see it's on at four
 Yeah 
 I'll watch that occasionally 
 He's got some real 
 I don't know 
 there's some real weird people that he seems to come up with
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 He does have some real bizarre things I think
 So other than that I don't know
 Guess I'm not much of a T V person really
 no
 It snowed a little bit probably about four days ago
 and they said we weren't going to get any more for Christmas

 and 
 Uh-huh

 I've I've probably talked maybe to five people
 My husband is doing it too 
 and he's talked to a few more than me 
 and but it's been real interesting and kind of fun
