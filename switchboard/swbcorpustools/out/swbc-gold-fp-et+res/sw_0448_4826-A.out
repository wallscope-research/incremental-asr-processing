 Okay 
 I'm here 
 How do you feel about public schools
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well that's interesting 
 I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw Georgia
 And she has a young boy Actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there 
 And she complained quite a bit about their school system there
 And 
 Right
 Right 
 I'm 
 I can't really say much about the schools up here 
 I really don't come from here 
 I'm only up here temporarily on an internship 
 but I live in Orlando Florida usually 
 And the schools down there from what I know are not bad 
 They're pretty good
 But I know that in some I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good
 For example I have a brother in North Carolina 
 and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad just terrible 
 
 Wow
 That is slow 
 Uh-huh
 What do you think's wrong to cause that 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Perhaps 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's that's one thing I worry about 
 There you go 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Probably quite a few black people up there 
 and and 
 is that right 
 okay
 Yeah 
 but you know it it's 
 you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever 
 but then again 
 Yeah 
 there is no denying that that 
 Sure you know 
 Teachers you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school 
 That's right 
 you can't do that
 Right
 See I grew up in Nebraska
 and the school that I went to there was fantastic 
 It 
 I I really consider myself very very lucky 
 we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty-seven thirty kids to sc- to a class 
 But 
 Yeah 
 We zipped right along you know 
 I I was I was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily
 
 Uh-huh 
 But you're right you know 
 With all this don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights you've also taken something away from the discipline I think 
 Yeah
 Right 
 I was going to ask you if there if that was an option
