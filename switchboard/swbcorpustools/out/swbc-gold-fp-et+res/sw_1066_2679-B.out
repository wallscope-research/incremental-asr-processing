 just here in Dallas
 Uh-huh
 That's 
 yes 
 yes 
 that's true 
 I've talked 
 Uh-huh 
 People from Virginia and and all over Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 okay 
 well the subject we're supposed to be talking about let's see is food
 What type of foods do you cook 
 and what would you cook in let's see if you were giving a dinner party 
 And the only reason why I may know a little bit about this is that I'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon
 And to me that's the type of thing that I like to give in cooking for people 
 And if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and you don't have to do all that much work You know you just slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce and away you go
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 Uh-huh
 What kind of meals did she make that you liked
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 No
 Sounds interesting uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's great
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 But that's that's why I like the the outdoor stuff a a lot better 
 People can entertain themselves I think a great deal more when you have a barbecue Especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and you know nothing really fancy like your your shish kabobs where you have to do a whole bunch of work
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Well I I think you do do a lot of work 
 Even if people do bring over things you still do all the housework and get ev- everything prepared and utensils and just just everything
 you know my mother used to make an Armenian rice dish
 I'm thinking about special dishes 
 and yeah 
 it was made out of rice and consume soup and bacon and onions
 And then you'd simmer it like all day long
 it would 
 Yeah 
 And it was just it was just wonderful 
 That's that's something that I would really like to to try and find the recipe for 
 But we used to have that at Thanksgiving time Because you can you can put it on top of the stove and do this 
 and and there's so much broth and juice in there that it has to soak up into the rice all day long in order for it to to come out fluffy and and nice 
 And that was you know 
 when you were talking about the the Polish dishes some goulashes and things like that 
 That's that's what I thought about was that Armenian rice dish
 That's true 
 That's true
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 You know what I found was at Sam's Wholesale stores 
 And what they have is this honey baked ham
 They 
 have you seen have you had any of those
 If if you ever get a chance to buy one of those I think it was twenty dollars for I don't remember how many pounds it was
 But you cook it in the bag that they send it in
 And all the juices and everything are all sealed in 
 And I tell you what i- it's never failed to come out tender and juicy and just and just delicious Because I normally don't like ham because it's so salty
 But with this honey bake that they have that that's the only one I have been able to find there at Sam's warehouse 
 It is absolutely delicious
 And it slices great Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Wow 
 You know that sounds like it
 But that's that's the only ham I have found that I thoroughly thoroughly enjoy
 Wow
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Right 
 That's true 
 I I don't think so anymore not with more becoming more conscious of fat and cholesterol and and all those good things
 yeah 
 Well my parents actually started it
 and getting 
 Well it it's true 
 I think my parents are very unusual because we grew up in the south where you have all the you know biscuits and gravy and fried foods galore 
 And then gradually they started switching over to plain rice no gravy
 It's just it really is 
 [ They + they're actually they actually led us through it versus us teaching them you know the the finer points 
 But my mother has really high cholesterol 
 so it was one of the reasons which started them off 
 And they started doing this like in the early in about the middle seventies
 yeah 
 It's true 
 it's true 
 I agree with you
 So it's really neat 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Wow
 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Wow that's good 
 Uh-huh
