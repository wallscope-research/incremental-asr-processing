 advice on son or daughter going to college
 that's advice that I will need in time future for my children rather than one that I have personal experience with 
 I suppose I would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet meet those needs
 What advice would you give
 I guess one clear-cut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus
 stay in a dormitory if you can 
 Go to classes 
 talk to faculty members and students
 Yes 
 I'm thinking what what problems my children might have in that 
 but I agree with you
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well course <> it it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and you're willingness one to to work during the summer or or part time And two to to take out loans to assume debt after college
 Yes
 Mine is twelve
 That's my gut feeling too 
 I 
 my son is certainly not persuaded of that <> 
 Hello
 yeah 
 yes 
 I didn't have a car in college 
 I think it's more an in- a burden to to provide for
 Is it 
 I didn't do any of those though 
 I feel less strongly about the T Vs and refrigerators
