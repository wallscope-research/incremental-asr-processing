 Yeah
 I wasn't in Central America 
 but talking about Latin America I kind of I consider Latin America to include Central and South America 
 and I did live in San Polo Brazil for four years
 realistically I 
 yes 
 I don't see the the Panama Canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not not really big enough to accommodate the the shipping that it once did 
 and maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however I think we're certainly justified in our actions dealing with Noriega in this 
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I haven't
 I have a a little bit 
 I can't say that I'm I would be an an expert on on the region 
 but certainly I it it gets it ge- there 
 your 
 you've got this this toss up betw- 
 or not not so much a toss up but a a dilemma when when you want a country to have its its own dominion or its free rein over its its own people 
 And then on the other hand the the government in power that under what seem what seems to be popular support the Sandinistas had to a given extent popular support starts making overtures to the Soviet Union And and into what we consider our sphere of influence 
 and now we're we're in this dilemma over United States is believes in democracy and and self determination where a- 
 but that 
 on the other hand we believe in self preservation and agree with the not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about infl- Soviet influence in in what's considered to be the United States sphere of the world which is not only you we used to see spheres 
 but now we're in a situation where the United States is looks like we're it now
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his his family
 Yeah 
 well yo- 
 in looking bu- 
 if you look at the region in in 
 to their detriment they came from this hundreds of years of Spanish control 
 and the and the Spaniards have horrible history of corrupt government greedy rulers who have been manipulating manipulating their public for their own their own good 
 if you go back to the kings and and the the conquistadors coming in and and the hor- incredibly horrible things they did to the the native tribes 
 they make they make the things that Custer did look like like trivial
 And you get 
 absolutely 
 and you know we set up 
 An 
 Ted Teddy Roosevelt didn't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for for nothing 
 and 
 Right
 The only the only thing I see about Cuba though is after Fidel Castro dies I don't think they'll be a communist power anymore 
 I I can't see communism in that country carrying on past him
 Yeah
 Right
 Ye- 
 well I I don't know if maybe communism is the right the right word for it 
 but what we would 
 there would have to be some kind of 
 there there may be a point at which at which you've you might want to consider some kind of socialistic organization or socialistic set up to to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy
 Right 
 right
 But cocoa leaves sell real well right now it seems 
 yeah
 Absolutely 
 I don't 
 it's going to be hard to 
 we 
 if you you 
 that that's where your absolutely right is we've got to do something in that region to encourage or [ to make to make him growing bananas profitable again 
 Right
 I've got to watch what I say here 
 I never know when the D I A may be listening on my phone 
 Right
 yeah 
 it's tempting 
 it's got to be it's got to be horribly tempting for those those peasants
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 you 
 it's not it's not just a matter of of having an extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of of feeding themselves their wife and their family 
 and and you 
 there's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family 
 and there's dishonor in not being able to do it
 and 
 No 
 no
 Uh-huh
 Right
