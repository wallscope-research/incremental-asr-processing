 I really haven't had too many problems 
 seems to me that everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out
 Yeah 
 I've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave all three 
 and they 
 unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time when I bought my new house 
 and I really don't have any recourse 
 so I had to call and have them all repaired and that
 Yeah 
 it was a hassle
 Yeah 
 the warranty on the refrigerator 
 the i- 
 the refrigerator warranty's still good 
 but the ice maker itself passed it's three years 
 and it was three years and two months
 No
 watch out
 Uh-huh
 
 I usually have pretty good luck with appliances 
 but I just 
 it was within two days that all three of these stopped working 
 and the the ice maker was had to have a new pump 
 and the microwave had to have some kind of something I can't even pronounce
 and they 
 the dryer had to have a new heating element 
 so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them
 within two days of each other 
 I was 
 it wasn't a good week 
 I was pretty mad
 {C And plus the place that I'd bought them all had gone out of business 
 so even if I I think even if I had had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that that manufactured 
 but still they were through that retailer 
 so I don't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not
 But I didn't have to worry about all that because they weren't under warranty
 So It was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all 
 but I 
 the only other things that I've ever had trouble with 
 I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers
 Yeah 
 I've had two or three of those go out 
 One was under warranty 
 and the other two weren't 
 but I just 
 other than that you know T Vs and things like that I haven't ever had any trouble with 
 I don't think products are getting much better though
 really
 That's interesting
 Do you do you test each individual one
 or do you just test 
 like if you've got ten you test one 
 and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay
 Uh-huh
 Well that's something I've never had to use 
 it's never I've never been involved in an automobile accident 
 so luckily that's a product that I haven't had to test
 But I think it's a great idea 
 I'm I'm 
 seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about 
 but that 
 I'm sure they want to be thorough before they 
 But even 
 you know I don't mind spending the extra money on the car if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing 
 I'm not a real big seat belt
