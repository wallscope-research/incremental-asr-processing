 I I start 
 Okay 
 Well we keep a budget to an extent
 and really i- i- we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm I'm paid once a month which sort of sort of forces some restrictions 
 and you need to make sure all your bills are paid 
 about yourself
 Yeah 
 Well I guess that really is sort of keeping a budget 
 you know You stay within your within your means
 Yeah
 Yes 
 you moved from Dallas to San Francisco 
 That is a hugh difference
 Yeah
 But you have good sour dough 
 and it's a beautiful place to live 
 Yeah
 *[[ Labelled as an indep slash unit since A's next turn is so voluminous before B24 ]] Uh-huh
 *[[ See B22 note ]] Yeah 
 Well that that's a system too
 Well then again you know you said you you are able to take trips 
 And you do obviously have enough to live on
 so I guess you're indirectly budgeting just bye-bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal in spending the money 
 So that's that's a form of budgeting I would think <> 
 It's it's kind of a strange topic to to try to for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money
 Yeah
 well we're we have one on the way
 my wife 
 and then we're we're having one on the way in in September
 No 
 I think it's just going to be one
 How about yourself
 
 Do they budget at all 
 do you have them on an allowance 
 Yeah
 Yeah
