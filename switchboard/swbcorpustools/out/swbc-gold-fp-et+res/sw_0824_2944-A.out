 well I've had time to think about it because we've had 
 i- 
 i- 
 there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to 
 so So I I was thinking about a couple things and whether they are serious 
 Some things are serious 
 and some aren't 
 I guess the biggest thing that bothers me is is 
 not the biggest thing 
 but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information situation that you that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any s- sort of credit e- extensive checks and and things of that nature
 When 
 I I don't know if that's an invasion of privacy simply I I do t- I do feel it is 
 but I don't know whether some of the questions they ask are legitimate because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your 
 Uh-huh
 Well I guess I guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact that once you give your social security number there are people I guess who are who are actually collecting all this all the time 
 and and profiles are given 
 I understand 
 I read the other day that these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone all all they need now is your telephone number which I guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not
 I I I feel that is an invasion of privacy 
 but it 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 exactly
 Yeah
 My God Yeah
 Yeah 
 I I have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me 
 well by b- 
 I make my living by flying airplanes for for a company
 And as a as a an airline pilot I have to take random drug testing
 it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time 
 so I when I finish a a certain flight on a random basis I have to have a wri- a drug test 
 and and and that's without i- probably cause
 and a- 
 and in the end now they've tested they've spent forty million dollars 
 and they've found I think in pilots anyway of something like eighty-six thousand tests there's only been two guys have come up three guys have come up positive 
 and one of them was a bad test 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Drug test 
 righ- 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 right
 Yes 
 I am
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I I can understand the public's alarm to it
 but I guess having done this all my life I knew that there wasn't a problem 
 and and it indeed it has proved out that way 
 but now try to get the damn thing repealed you know
 I guess I feel bad because 
 not only that 
 but in some of the instances like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints wha- what what happens if you say no 
 If you say no then you're excluded 
 and I 
 doesn't seem the courts 
 Yeah
 That's right
 It's my feeling also that that that although 
 I I don't know if it's that serious i- 
 but that was part of the question
 I do feel the courts have have held up a great deal of of our privacy particularly look in in some of the in some of the 
 I notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy which I support of course 
 but it I guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that it does seem that we've we've slipped and that's eroded 
 or at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that you know it's fair game 
 t- 
 you you have to answer these questions of course
 I don't know 
 I I feel there has been an erosion 
 and I don't really know how serious it is except I don't like it 
 
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 What was that 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Right
 Well it it 
 just take that that step now where where now we feel there's a need to do that 
 and the next thing you know then there's always the need to to go and inspect lockers of high school students 
 tha- 
 Yeah 
 I guess so 
 well good luck to you 
 you just moved to Texas from Minneapolis 
 I don't I don't hold out much hope for you 
 I think they'll be a cultural shock 
 I was based there a lot several times in the service 
 and I was absolutely flabbergasted at the 
 in in at least in criminal law some of the some of the latitudes that the police had 
 but 
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 
 Yeah
 Well I don't understand
 if you if you don't 
 if they don't make a criminal check why do you have to be fingerprinted
 I see 
 the state doesn't require it 
 Well that's kind of that's rather that's rather unusual isn't it 
 Well I guess I guess the extension of that is why why not 
 the next thing you know we'll just stop a random amount of motorists 
 and then if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street
 they do
 Yeah
 Well there's there's all sorts of scare tactics I guess to to invade our privacy 
 and 
 Yeah
 I just going to say NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR is come an- is come and gone 
 but it's here
 And the computers of course helps that 
 The computer abilities store that information
