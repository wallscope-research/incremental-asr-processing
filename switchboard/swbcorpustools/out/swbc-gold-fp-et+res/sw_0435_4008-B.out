 Yes 
 I have a Macintosh S E thirty
 Uh-huh
 What do you use yours for mostly
 Uh-huh
 Well I do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base 
 and about the only thing 
 I am I'm just starting to get into a little bit more communications now 
 I've just today ordered a fax modem 
 so I'll be able to send and receive faxes right over there without using you know 
 you don't have to make a hard copy that way
 are you using windows
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well it's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh 
 Uh-huh
 Well the one thing I used to use a 
 I've never used an I B M actually 
 I used to use a just an Apple two E which of course is looks pretty primitive now
 But I don't have any any real programming capabilities on my Mac right now
 I don't have any compilers
 so I'm 
 I use it in my business
 I do consultation and and testing of various kinds for English as a second language programs
 That's exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing I'm working with exactly
 You seem to be better informed than the average person on that
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Well now we 
 what I use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though 
 Most of the stuff that I do is not interactive
 and I use it for t- data analysis on testing 
 so 
 Well just actually just item analysis statistical analysis of the tests 
 You know when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is 
 you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort 
 So it's involves a lot of spreadsheet use
 Well I was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly and with smaller files 
 I can't believe you know I've got five megabytes on this one now
 and on my two E I had a hundred twenty-eight K 
 Yeah
 the old the old Apple the the original Apple had what yeah forty-eight I guess didn't it
 My goodness 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Well the S P thirty goes up to eight
 but I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet 
 I think probably when I get system seven I may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk 
 I don't know 
 They say that system seven uses a lot of memory
