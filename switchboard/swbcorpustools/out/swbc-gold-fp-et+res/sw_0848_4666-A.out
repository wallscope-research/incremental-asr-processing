 I imagine you can't escape it 
 Well of course it was fun for you 
 To
 really
 I was born and raised in near Miami and spent the last twenty years in Dallas where the Rangers played
 And for the last what year roughly year I've been in San Francisco where there are two teams The Oakland As and the San Francisco Giants
 but honestly you know I I do my duty and watch the sports on the newscasts
 but that's about all the exposure I have to sports
 Uh-huh 
 <> yeah 
 sure
 Well I guess the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland As were like the leading teams a couple of years ago
 Well I th- 
 well I don't know 
 That's sort of what I gather
 and I don't know 
 What is the prognosis for this year
 Good 
 I I assume that means good for the Minnesota 
 Yep 
 I think a train went by
 I know a train went by 
 I don't know what the noise was 
 but I think it probably was the the train
 Well I don't know 
 I I I don't even know who has been winning in as far as the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland As 
 but I think they both won their opener 
 I sort of gathered that in my subliminal memory
 Huh 
 Uh-huh 
 I guess they are different leagues 
 Is that right 
 The As 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Eighty-six
 Huh
 Well they must play every day then
 I mean eighty-six times two is a hundred sixty
 And that's Lord that's over five months worth
 Even if they play every day that's over five months worth
 No
 That was the Super Bowl
 I don't feel so bad 
 I think you you don't know all that much more than I do about baseball 
 I see 
 okay

 okay 
 Well I I know the Super Bowl
