 Well I don't know how much publicity it's gotten outside of the state 
 but California we just put somebody to death for I think it was a double murder 
 to be honest I didn't pay that much attention to the details of it 
 but it had a lot of controversy out here 
 basically because in California people like to protest about everything
 but I agree 
 I believe that that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go
 the big disagreement I have is that in California the appeals process is so extensive and takes so long that you end up spending a huge amount of money in like ten to fifteen years before you can actually you know put somebody to death for for a crime 
 And that's that's ridiculous 
 if you can you know y- y- the trial is supposed to prove you know within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty
 and then they have appeals 
 Well that's fine 
 but it shouldn't take more than a few years 
 I should think two or three years maximum you should be able to know 
 and you should be able to either put the guy to death 
 or he's innocent 
 it's if he's guilty for for you know multiple murders or whatever the case may be you know
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 he was like 
 the the defense the defense they're were giving given was that like his mother had had been an alcoholic when when she was pregnant with him 
 and so he he wasn't you know mentally competent or anything else Which is ridiculous
 and and the court found him competent 
 and he knew what he was doing and everything else 
 you know it was it was the best defense they could come up with
 I forget 
 I think it was something like twelve years or something 
 It was it was something really outrageous
 Yeah
 I think in general punishment in the United States is a lot weaker than it should be 
 it needs to be you know 
 it's kind of like the + the ] justice system in the United States is kind of like the dog poops on the carpet 
 and you wait three months 
 and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it You know 
 there there's no connection between the two
 you take these you know most of the people who are committing violent crimes most of them not all by any means 
 but you know a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place
 they don't really see past next week much less next year
 And to say you know well if I kill somebody then a decade from now I might face the punishment
 That's not real 
 It doesn't have any real impact on them
 Uh-huh
 you mean would he be put to death for that
 largely depends on the circumstances 
 and generally you know from what I understand it's it's only the most brutal types of things usually 
 Where it's multiple you know 
 If if they can say things like you know well he was just you know temporarily insane because of some domestic squabble then you know they'll they'll give him you know twenty years with with parole in in twelve or something like that
