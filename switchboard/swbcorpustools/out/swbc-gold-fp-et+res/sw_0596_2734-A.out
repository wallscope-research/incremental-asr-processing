 What's the 
 in Texas law has a <> what does it have it has a death penalty doesn't it
 But now it's coming back into favor
 Well my sociology class at S M U's taught us that it was not a deterrent 
 but now that's just what they said 
 I don't know maybe maybe if I went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent
 Maybe they've changed their minds
 Maybe that's it 
 Maybe that's it 
 because that was back in the seventies
 I think 
 I agree 
 But I think it ought to be expanded to include children 
 I I think they're they have they're working on something in Austin now
 and I'm not sure what it is 
 I just remember seeing a kind of a synopsis of it
 Well I'm I'm personally very in favor of it
 why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or t- or tried to or done their very you know given their best effort at doing that
 I I don't care to support them
 Sure 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 And then there was the black woman that robbed and shot the furrier 
 And she was set free too just in two examples in Texas recently
 But she actually killed the furrier Or someone 
 she was charged with murder 
 and then then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something 
 I didn't I don't I didn't retain all those facts very well 
 But I know what you're 
 what if we make a mistake
 And that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything
 Well Well I guess though where I would have a problem with it if I were on the jury that that put that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty
 Now that's tougher 
 It's easier to say it on the telephone 
 and everyone agree that yeah the death penalty's the way to go 
 it's a deterrent to crime 
 they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway 
 But to be the actual one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me
 I think I'd probably do it 
 but we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance 
 It that's that's that's a real easy thing to say that sure I would 
 but I don't know 
 Well yes 
 but you know that's what they did
 Or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted
 And they they wanted something worse than they more than they respect the human life
 Hang them 
 Yeah 
 I agree it should be in effect 
 Also I agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement 
 so I guess I would say I want it to be in effect 
 but I want <> maybe 
 well I'd I now I have a problem with this too 
 I think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance
 That's correct 
 It is 
 it is
 Now there's some 
 and maybe now I don't remember if this is Texas or not that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence
 Convicted drug dealers
 Is it what is what's the ru- 
 It's something of the dis- they're on the distribution end
 They're not selling them 
 they're distributing them 
 It's for the large dealers is what it's reserved for 
 And they they are in effect killing people
 okay
 Is that how it's worded 
 I knew it was there 
 but I I 
 or p- or is it proposed 
 or is it passed
 I believe it is
 I believe you're right though 
 I think it is 
 And I have to agree with that
 I I think it certainly should be one of the options 
 I've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren so far that I know 
 I qualify that heavily
 because you never know 
 but to the best of my knowledge we haven't had a major problem yet
 But it just touches so many young people *[[slash error]] *[[slash error]] Well my children are about in the same age bracket 
 I think let's see the oldest is thirty-two 
 and the youngest is probably twenty-seven twenty-eight
 So it's the same age bracket
 And there's four two girls and two boys 
 And I think one of each experimented very slightly with pot
 and I think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge
 Boy 
 that's tough
 My husband hasn't quit yet 
 And he knows he has to 
 and he knows he should 
 and he knows 
 and he knows
 but he hasn't 
 I do respect the fact though that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me 
 He he's very conscious of of passive smoking 
 and he's concerned about it but hasn't quite made it yet 
 Yeah 
 I've seen all of this 
 yeah 
 Well Charles will actually Charles will not smoke in anyone else's house except our own
 He will get up 
 and he'll go outside you know 
 and he he's 
 so when we're invited to people's house he will not smoke in their house Which I think is good because there's a lot of people that are very 
 particularly if they have children
 But and he's you know he tries his best 
 but the actual quitting he hasn't done 
 He changed brands to a brand he doesn't like 
 He put up all of his ash trays 
 He will not smoke in a comfortable position you know 
 but still he's done everything the Smokers Anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking 
 It's a long process 
 how neat
 He has his in the kitchen
