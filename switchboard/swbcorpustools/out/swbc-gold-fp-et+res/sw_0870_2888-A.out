 <> Okay
 
 I get my current events basically from news just because I watch pretty much a lot of television 
 
 I watch a little bit of everything 
 I like to tune into to C N N because you know you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on everything in about five or ten minutes 
 I think news today it's kind of losing its importance 
 Like on in on radio if you hear any news at all it's like two seconds
 You know really quickly on regular stations
 Yeah 
 that's good too 
 uh-huh 
 I like K R L D
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 where do you go to school
 Okay 
 I went to U T at Austin
 But I'm a news reporter 
 so I I should get all I can my news from the new- from the T V
 But 
 Yeah 
 I usually don't intentionally Although I should I don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news
 Or I don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news 
 If it comes on I just happen to hear it 
 Now I will intentionally buy a newspaper to wa- to <> to look at the news 
 But other 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 That's about it 
 The Sunday paper it's so full of stuff 
 but you pick your favorite section 
 and the rest you throw away
 Although you paid what almost two dollars now to get it 
 but 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Is it is it pretty good coverage on there
 Yeah 
 yeah
 
 Because I find like on K R L D 
 I like to listen to that 
 but each story is like no more than two or three lines you know
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that would probably be better 
 Especially when you look for the like popular radio stations like mostly the music stations news is is pretty much nonexistent
 They have little little teeny-weeny news breaks you know
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 basically
 Yeah
 So let's see 
 Uh-huh
 The only reason I get trade journals is like if I'm looking for a job or something Which is what I'm doing now
 But 
 Yeah 
 trying to get out of wherever they are 
 but I think I think news is 
 I'm wondering where it's going 
 You know how 
 I think it will be nonex- pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper 
 I know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news 
 And now it's it's kind of your final choice 
 You watch 
 first you go to C N N then you go to radio or something like that
 And I think it 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 So much more effort 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 But I think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again
 I don't 
 well just because I'm I'm thinking that it it's getting so short on radio 
 You still you have two or three 
 I know in Dallas you can probably get two two all news radio stations out of I don't how many popular radio stations 
 And then on television you have just the news at six and ten
 And I just I just see that dwindling in in 
 True 
 yeah
 True 
 That's true too 
 yeah 
 Than sit down and take the effort to read the paper
 One thing I like about the paper as opposed <> to television is that when I like when I report because I'm in television I have to get the basic the main facts and that's it 
 That's all you have time for
 Whereas in the paper I like to read the articles because they get every side every single side 
 and and every point they make you know And and it's all there
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 because that's what we do 
 it's like each story is thirty seconds you know
 So it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time 
 So and it will probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by I think 
 I don't know
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 I think that is one good thing one great thing about news 
 and we saw it during the war just now is that we got all the information within minutes you know
 Whatever happened we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Because even though we do get the story right away they were censored as to what they could tell us 
 So all we had to sit here and and ask is well what aren't they telling us you know 
 So that that was pretty scary 
 But we 
 I talked to one woman 
 and she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in Saudi Arabia she wouldn't want to know you know that they're bombing or or this and that's going on 
 And at the same time I talked to another woman 
 and she was so happy to know because she lived through Vietnam 
 And she didn't know what was happening at that time
 And she was so happy to get the information you know 
 So there's just a lot of different opinions on that 
 But 
 Yeah
 And then too a lot of times I think especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion
 Like 
 You know like this Kennedy thing
 <> It's just everywhere you turn 
 Kennedy 
 Kennedy 
 Kennedy 
 You know what kind of shoes did he wear on the night 
 And you know it's just like okay this is ridiculous 
 So 
 But what are you doing 
 Sitting on a computer
 I heard the little clicking
 okay 
 Well it was nice talking to you
 Okay
 Take care
 Uh-huh 
 bye
