 Okay 
 how's the weather been in Plano 
 Yeah 
 this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city
 Well I don't know about you 
 but I was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks 
 and I'm ready for it to come back
 Well not the rain so much as the cool the other mornings when it was like sixty-five when we woke up and sixty-six 
 and today I know when I got up that the temperature said more like close seventy-nine or eighty
 so I'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather
 You don't
 are you a summer person
 Are you
 Well I have a friend who's the same way 
 and anything below sixty she's just not happy
 but I I think what I would miss is the change of seasons and all because I know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as 
 my husband's from Nebraska 
 and they have more of the four seasons
 you're used to that too
 You don't like the cold 
 Well I usually like it about sweater weather 
 and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long 
 It goes from hot 
 and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer 
 and then it's cold
 and I wish it were several months of that
 Well I don't either unless it's like 
 some of my favorite's like a Friday night when it rains 
 and you really didn't have anywhere to go 
 and it's sleeping time 
 But if you have to get up and get out in it I don't like it either 
 yeah
 Well sure it does 
 That kind of schedule you really need a lot more sunshine
 And also the evenings are going to be getting darker sooner becau- as it gets cooler
 But I did a walk last night 
 and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still 
 Sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler
 Well I agree absolutely 
 and you know it's all relative 
 because I was from West Texas 
 and it was very dry 
 and so I thought Dallas was awful 
 and I still think so
 but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week 
 and it was so humid there that your all your windows were fr- were wet every morning 
 They had to get the squeejies and clean them off 
 And when we got back to Dallas it seemed really dry because it's kind of like what you're used to 
 But I agree with you 
 the humidity especially for curly heads like me 
 Yes 
 I do not like the humid- 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think so too 
 I know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains
 but it seems like here 
 I would like it to rain and then be over and then not rain for a while 
 It seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern that's all it does
 So but I I am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like 
 I guess my my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six and then probably seventy-five during the day
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 are you do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 keep it there 
 Yeah
 Well I do too 
 I do too
 and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it 
 But then we started thinking especially in Plano the weather is so hot in August that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow
 Static here
 Yeah
 We do too 
 I think a lot of people agree the same
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 now there have been worse summers 
 In fact this morning when they were talking about Harold Taft they were talking about how this has been one of the milder of the summers and milder fall 
 everybody seems to be 
 you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat because they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're melting
 and you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we're it'll be too cold 
 and they'll say 
 well those are the ones that like the cold weather
 yeah 
 he did 
 he did 
 It was it was really a shame 
 He didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did
 It's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes 
 is that right
 Okay
 good
 Well good 
 well then have a good day
 And I hope you enjoy the weather this week
