 Well do you own a P C
 wow
 What processor does it have in it
 what kind of work do you do on it
 okay
 Yeah
 yeah 
 I don't own a P C 
 but I've I've yeah I work for T I 
 and 
 Well I have pretty fa- a fairly fancy one 
 it's a T I model 
 It's an S P one thousand which has a it has a fast processor in it a three eighty-six
 And I 
 the the job that I do 
 I do a lot of training of our customers for new products
 And I have to develop functional specs and disk and desk top publishing and everything 
 so it's it's kind of fun
 I I always say that I need to buy a computer for the house 
 but I just haven't got around to doing it yet
 Your husband what what group is your husband in
 Oh 
 Defense systems and electronics group
 I see 
 Yeah
 okay
 Yeah 
 I work on printers and the peripheral products division basically 
 I work in the airline ma- marketing group
 So we we do a lot of 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Is he a programmer
 I see
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Really 
 So does your husband ever use a laptop or a notebook 
 Does he bring a little one home with him 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 I see 
 Yeah 
 we we build laptop and notebook computers here in Temple also
 And those are really handy 
 we they they have modems in them you can send a fax from your P C
 but they're they're really 
 What's that
 Yeah 
 they're they're pretty handy because you know when I travel it's easy to check messages 
 just you know plug in the phone to your computer and dial in 
 and 
 okay 
 Yeah 
 I just found out I'm going to Denver Sunday night again
 So that kind of reeks havoc with plans
 but it it's really not enough to become a big hassle
 I see
 Well I don't know 
 there you can get well 
 depends on what you consider expensive 
 
 you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars where you know just a few years ago it would have been six seven eight nine thousand dollars
 Yeah 
 it's still 
 you know two thousand dollars isn't just just pocket change to a lot of people 
 Yeah 
 when I started at T I I was a Summer development student and finishing up at school 
 and so those papers really 
 it was nice having access to the equipment to 
 Yeah
 Well how many different types of packages do you use
 Uh-huh
 okay 
 Yeah 
 Golly 
 I've got 
 up up at work anyway I use WordPerfect and Lotus and and which is a a line-draw package
 Yeah 
 You probably use or something like that for your data entry stuff that your talking about
 Do you get do you work at home all the time 
 or just 
 Uh-huh
 that that was that worked out pretty good then
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 So it keeps you in the company 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Boy 
 I tell you if I could bring a computer home and do stuff here I'd get all kinds of stuff done
 Phone's always ringing 
 and people always asking me to do something else
 I've got a lot of 
 especially right now we've got several new products coming out 
 and I've got lots of documentation I need to review and some I need to revise
 Well yeah 
 but you know I need to be at the office too
 You know I've just got to deal with all those other things that happen 
 but a P C at the house would really take a lot of the load off
 Uh-huh 
 well I've I've done that before on a couple times
 But that would make it just that much easier 
 instead of bringing home a computer you just bring home a few floppy disks you know
 my
 Man that sounds really nice
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah 
 I've got a lot of folks that I've worked with like that as well
 Yeah 
 we sort of stayed to the topic anyway
 Okay 
 well we'll talk to you later
 Bye
