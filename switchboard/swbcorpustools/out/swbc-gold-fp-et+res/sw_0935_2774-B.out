 Yes
 yes 
 we have brick on the outside 
 and the colors that were there changed the and the colors that we painted changed the entire look of the house
 Completely 
 Yeah 
 That was really exciting 
 It was fun
 Huh-uh 
 So the other thing that we did was the roof of our house
 And we did that a different color also
 Of course being a woman most of these things were done by the men
 And so I wasn't directly involved 
 but they really were helpful I know to our house
 Yeah 
 Yes 
 Huh-uh 
 As a matter of fact [ one thing + {A I have a young son 
 and } one thing ] we did was we had paneling on [ the inside of our front of our house the hall way of our house ] rather 
 and we were repainting the the front room in the hall there 
 and we took down that paneling 
 and he helped me 
 and and he was it was fun to work with him And and help putty up the holes together and and do things like that
 I like it so much better 
 It makes it so much lighter
