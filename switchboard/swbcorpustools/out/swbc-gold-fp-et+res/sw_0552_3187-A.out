 How would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home
 Uh-huh
 Right
 And what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him
 my
 Yeah
 so the convenience 
 Right
 My grandmother lived with us until August 
 and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home 
 She has leukemia
 and her the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton and were several thousand miles away
 so I made the decision to put her in a nursing home 
 and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility 
 She had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and T V set
 so 
 Yes
 And that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two 
 so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room
 so she didn't have to be transported back and forth 
 So she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well 
 It's not her favorite place to be in 
 She'd much rather be here with me 
 But when it got to the point I was spending more time at the hospital with her 
 and I've got little children here who needed me here
 she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day
 So
 She was falling down and hemorrhaging 
 and you know all kinds of physical problems 
 so it just became too much for me to handle 
 even though I would have liked to have had her stay with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yes 
 well I think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions 
 It sure wouldn't have been Granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home 
 but she's accepted it real well now
 so
 Well we enjoyed having her here 
 but we feel she's much safer where she is now 
 She still continues to fall 
 but when she does there a nurse is right there to help her
 and I know she's eating the right things 
 and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her 
 so It became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
 so I think she'll adjust
