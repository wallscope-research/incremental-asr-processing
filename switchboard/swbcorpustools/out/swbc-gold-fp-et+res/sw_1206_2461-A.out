 Okay 
 we're going to talk about the public school system What's wrong with it an or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's amazing 
 I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough to be doing what they're doing 
 When I was in college I I enjoyed teaching 
 'cause I did some teaching part-time 
 and I really enjoyed that 
 but I wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high 
 it just you know all the problems
 Yeah 
 they're putting in fifty sixty hours a week 
 I'm sure because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready
 And you know and they're being paid probably half what most people being paid
 And we're paying basketball people you know millions of dollars a year for for what you know
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's 
 Now do you have little kids or what
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 my wife and I have a a three year old almost four and a a two year old
 So we're looking at the the older one going to school next year Not not well not this coming fall but the year after that
 Yeah 
 he's going to be going to kindergarten 
 so 
 So you know we're we're thinking about that 
 What's that going to be like 
 Are they going to be taught nothing 
 or they going be taught something 
 we're going to we're going to be involved in our child's education 
 We're going to be teaching him what we can at home of course because I guess we don't trust the school system which is very sad 
 but But if it doesn't start at home it's not going to go anywhere You know 
 and we're going to try to teach him good values because you know we- when when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them well hey if you can play football or basketball that's what's important Not if you can read or write or do or un- understand some science You know 
 give me a break 
 that's that's that's bogus
 Yeah
 And Dallas school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling
 I couldn't believe that
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we talked you talked about before about the school funding 
 I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way 
 but I think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids 
 That's the only way they're going to fund it because if they start raising taxes for property and people are going to throw a fit
 yeah
 Yeah 
 and the only thing they they would think of would be tuition you know 
 if it works at colleges it will work down below
 And you know that's going to that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do 
 But it will be hard for those that people that have have in school because they have to pay out even more
 yeah
 That's right
 And most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and and knives and everything 
 good grief what's 
 I can't believe that 
 when I was in junior high and high school that never happened 
 You never heard about that
 No 
 And now you know what do we have now 
 You know got kids that either got a you know a Magnum gun school 
 like good grief
 I'd I'd be afraid to be in school b- teaching or even being a student 
 and think what what's it going to be like for my my youngest an my oldest son when he goes to school 
 What's going to happen 
 I I'm afraid for him to go
 But there again you can't hold them back
 Yeah 
 and lot tougher than it was when I was going to school 
 and that was 
 well I was I graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine 
 so 
 That was what twelve years ago I guess
 So you know it's lot different now 
 And what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my oldest son is in high school
 I'm afraid to I'm afraid to even think about it
 That's all you can do
 You got to you got to be your child's best friend I guess even when they're a teenager and they you know are kind of standoffish 
 still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems who they going to go to their friends that are dealing drugs or or your parents You know 
 an and if they go to their friends dealing drugs they're going to be in even worse shape
 And and the schools don't don't really encourage to stay away from that you know 
 the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera 
 They don't teach them good values like drugs are bad 
 I maybe I'm wrong because I haven't you know been in that kind of environment for a long time 
 but it just is amazing you know 
 need to teach them good values
 Of course wh- if I say this is a good value someone else is going to stand up and say no 
 And the A C L U is going to get after them and have a lawsuit Which is going to take twenty years to resolve you know
 Yeah
 That's all you can do
 That's right 
 Well I got to be going 
 so 
 Nice talking to you today
 Have a good life
