 I think we're overtaxed to the hilt
 Yeah 
 we're we're taxed on taxes 
 and most all government entities are just trying to give us a state income tax for those who don't have it that is 
 we don't have one yet 
 but eventually they may try to push it through
 No no state income tax
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits
 Right
 Yeah
 Well we're really overburdened from federal state and local that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck
 Uh-huh
 Well they're kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well
 And I think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue that's fairness and all is for us to limit their terms
 And by doing so they're not obligated to anybody
 And I don't know how we're going to do that right away though 
 but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is it's just taking a bite out of our savings
 Yeah
 And I believe the Social Security tax is a great scheme
 Yeah 
 it's you know 
 right now they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit
 Yeah 
 tha- that's illegal see 
 If most company C E Os were to do that within their private company they'd be in jail
 So how are we letting them get away with it
 Right
 Yeah 
 A lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to oppose a lot of the situations going on in the taxing system
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Well there's no quick solution or no sure fire easy answer 
 It's just going to take really a combination effort I think of the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer or vote to limit the way it's spent
 See we we're we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place
 Right 
 and they are controlled or pretty much do what they want to do
 Well they feel invu- invulnerable to any wrath 
 or it's it's occurred so many times that they figure people will usually forget and don't think about it when the election time arises
 And generally it does work out that way
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well when you get out into the real world then you'll know
 Yeah
 Bonus time 
 you have a bonus
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 So you're taxed on the bonuses too 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 sales is lucrative 
 but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Well I have I guess about said what a- all I can think of to say
 Yeah 
 it's re- a rather touchy topic at that 
 but 
 Well that's great
 You too 
 and 
 have a good day
