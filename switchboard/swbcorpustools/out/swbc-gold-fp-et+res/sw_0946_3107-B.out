 Boy I I don't know 
 That's a that's a a tough one 
 and it's I suppose it's it's changes as as percep- my perception changes of of what I'm getting gypped on 
 and 
 this week this month we're just going through well there's a couple of changes to the to the our health plan 
 and and I guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance 
 but If I step back I'm not sure I'd I'd say that 
 What what about you
 okay
 Yes 
 okay
 But but on the other hand one of these days you'll be out looking for a 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right 
 okay
 And and yeah 
 and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars a semester you you never use because you just use your wife's
 yeah 
 I it the the that that's a a negative about where where I am in that well I came out of I worked five years civil service 
 and there it's if I remember right you well they they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and or hours per pay period or something 
 but anyway it works out as I remember basically to 
 you start at at two and a half weeks or something like that 
 and it at three years it goes to four weeks I believe 
 and I I'm coming up on I've been at T I now coming up on fifteen years 
 and it and it just this year is going to go to four weeks here 
 so 
 
 Yeah 
 [ that's a + that that is a a a negative but but not probably not at probably not a deciding factor 
 but 
 Yeah
 Well that that 
 yeah 
 that's that's the thing is how how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things 
 and that's the the the 
 yeah 
 That's a why it hasn't made all that much difference is because the with the civil service that you could take you could take your vacation in increments of one hour
 and and but there wasn't anything as far as comp time 
 so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year you know an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing
 whereas here I things are free enough to that the the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that isn't that much different 
 but But 
 Yeah 
 I think the I think the health insurance 
 I think that's that's going through changes everywhere to 
 the they've gone through a couple years ago here where they will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals 
 and now they're in the process of developing a list of of designated doctors 
 so that just routine visits they will compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors
 Which which 
 my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since he keeps real busy without having to to 
 Yeah
 Well and and I think in the in the in the much bigger picture than to some extent hospitals and doctors have some fixed amount 
 and if if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to to give you you know give you these rates and make this agreement then you're not covered by that 
 and and the added costs get passed on to you 
 so I'm not I'm not sure 
 it my one of the phrases I use is that that it's moving towards private socialized medicine That in terms of the negatives of of always heard in terms of socialized medicine you have no choice on who you who you go to for a doctor and things like that where it's the government that decides 
 here it's it's 
 Yeah 
 and but it but it's the the same the effect is the same as the 
 you you get left out of the loop more 
 I I I know that their idea is that if if you have to pay a bigger share you'll you'll be more careful about spending the spending the money and and helping hold down the costs
 but I I I don't know 
 in terms of in terms of the health care I find that that although I've I've been lucky enough to never have any big problems but that that the cost is not a a big factor 
 I want to I want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and
