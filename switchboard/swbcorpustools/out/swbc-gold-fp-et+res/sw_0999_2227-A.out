 Okay 
 so you watch DAVID LETTERMAN
 Well see our favorite T V show 
 I I I live in a dorm
 and our favorite T V show is CHEERS
 Okay
 well we try 
 like here they show it like every day
 And then like on Thursdays is the night where the new ones come on
 But we watch it like every day 
 But I like late night we don't watch 
 what we do is we stay up till around one thirty
 and then they show the TWILIGHT ZONE at one thirty
 and so we just stay and watch that
 The what
 Yeah
 I used I used to live in the house that the guy owned
 Yeah 
 it was really it was really well it was all full with shelves everywhere 
 and we didn't have enough books to fill it up 
 but But so what what do you like why do you like DAVID LETTERMAN
 So the 
 do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 
 What 
 He's got what
 Hey I got long hair 
 wait 
 wait 
 I don't know 
 but people 
 the other day I went into a bar 
 and this guy asked me to dance
 All he saw was my hair 
 and he goes do you want to dance 
 I turn around and go what
 He goes do you want to dance 
 I go no 
 no 
 he goes I'm sorry 
 I go yeah 
 you better be 
 I go you better be 
 so But okay so d- wait 
 do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE yesterday
 Yeah
 No 
 you missed WAYNE'S WORLD
 WAYNE'S WORLD was pretty cool
 So let's see 
 what else 
 see like all we do here is like every time we walk in the room we turn on the T V because we don't want to do anything like study or anything
 so all the all we do is turn 
 like like when I was in high school I used to do like my homework in front of the T V set you know
 What
 Yeah
 Well I like I I just I just bogused on all my homework 
 so it really didn't matter 
 Yeah 
 I know 
 and I did that all through college 
 and it worked 
 So let's see 
 what else 
 Like the news we don't watch because they're boring
 Yeah 
 especially the war 
 it was like I haven't I seen this episode before you know
 Yeah 
 I know
 And and in North C- 
 see the the thing is like here they just they just give you like local news okay
 Like a house burned down in this little town
 And were here 
 and I go so what happened worldwide you know
 It's like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they're not going to tell you you know
 they're going to spend more time on doing a a thing on a on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old than they are on anything else you know
 So but let's see 
 what else 
 we watch like for example 
 okay 
 do you watch STAR TREK
 Okay 
 well I used to hate STAR TREK
 I thought I thought 
 like when it like when I was like in high school and junior high school I used to hate it
 but then we started watching it
 And and like the new ones are pretty cool because because they got like like special like especially things that like fuck with your mind
 Because what happened is like they have this hologram right where you walk in 
 and you can program 
 and everything looks real 
 and you can touch everything and stuff
 But it's only a program 
 and it's really great because sometimes it's like the hologram makes up all these things 
 and sometimes it sometimes it's funny 
 sometimes it's not 
 but you know it's something to pass the time till we do 
 and then and then we watch football
 Which basketball
 College or 
 We got we got two teams of the A C C going there
 We got Duke and North Carolina
 But the there's nothing to do 
 like for example yesterday they go s- some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right 
 I hear no 
 *[[looks mistranscribed]] we're just you know it's like we just woke up
 we had a hangover and everything you know 
 And so we just woke up 
 and we're watching T V 
 and I go no 
 today we're just going to dedicate ourself to watching golf and bowling you know 
 and everybody it was like God do you guys really watch that
 No 
 you know I was 
 like a whole golf tournament it's 
 like for example baseball 
 I hate baseball 
 Somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball 
 and the actual play time that there is is five minutes
 Because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it's hit
 Okay
 and that's like you know five seconds for the whole play
 and that's it 
 maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know 
 But it's it's like that 
 it's was it's just 
 but when I went home that's all like they had on T V
 so I tu- I watched entire games of baseball 
 and they're going my God 
 And T V in Argentina's really bad
 because I wanted to go to school here
 Yeah
 they have better computer science up here than they than they do down there
 So and I also my father works for I B M
 and we came up here 
 we well we came to the United States in nineteen seventy-six seventy-seven and we lived here for about seven years 
 then we moved back
 And so then I said I'm going to move back up there to go to college
 He goes okay 
 So he goes but do it fast 
 so I did my undergraduate in two years
 Yeah 
 So but it's a it's just you know 
 well we've been talking for five minutes
 That's the only obligation we have
 And well tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks
 Okay
 All right 
 nice talking to you
 Bye-bye
