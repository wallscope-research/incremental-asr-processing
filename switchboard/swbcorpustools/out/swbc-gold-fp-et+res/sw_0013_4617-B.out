 I say they 
 probably the best things to do is is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water 
 if they sink they're innocent right
 Yeah 
 so how do you how do you feel 
 Th- that's of course being facetious 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And I guess also what the system will absorb 
 Probably more tuned in to that 
 Possibly though on capital cases like maybe the death penalty 
 I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole 
 he could have like a personal prejudice 
 You know judges are people like everybody else even though they're they're supposed to be impartial 
 but maybe 
 I I think that's I think that's the way it is
 whether they they decide whether or not they the accused or whatever would get the get the death penalty 
 Do they have a death penalty in California 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I 
 something like that I've got no problem with it 
 I guess the way I think about it is not it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge 
 It's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people
 put it to sleep you know 
 Just get it out you know 
 it's not able to fit in you know 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 I guess kind of the way I think about it also is they just 
 if somebody gets the death penalty they're they're judged guilty 
 they got the death penalty 
 they should have one year and one appeal Cover all their bases with one appeal 
 and if not you know don't don't let them sit up there on death row for you know fifteen years
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that 
 Yeah 
 I'm sure 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I believe it is in capital 
 I think in like lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever How ever many is on sitting on a jury 
 I t- I believe that's the way it is 
 But I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 no 
 I'm telling you go one way or the other 
 That that's probably an expensive trial 
 Yeah 
 Probably 
 Yeah 
 Probably 
 You know I'm not sure there's a number 
 It's probably like thirty forty thousand dollars a day you know worth of all the free for all
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that's that's been so long I've prac- practically forgot who Noriega was you know 
 That has been going on 
 My cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami
 Yeah 
 So she follows that stuff pretty closely 
 But 
 Yeah 
 she's not involved in that that case 
 But she does 
 No 
 I haven't 
 I never have 
 My wife has 
 but I I haven't 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
