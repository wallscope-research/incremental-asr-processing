 Wh- what's your 
 are you into the Cowboys
 yeah
 Well that that's all right 
 Yeah
 Well I don't know 
 I kind of go back and forth depending on whose really hot and whose not 
 I guess I'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects 
 But I guess if I have my druthers I'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks
 I kind of like them
 Yeah 
 They're kind of 
 Yo- 
 Yeah
 To be honest with you I I probably watch college a little bit more than I do pro
 Yeah
 I kind of like college actually 
 Quite a bit 
 Is it 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 That could be 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then
 No 
 I root for Nebraska quite a bit
 Ye- 
 Yeah
 Well I can see I can see definitely how you get into that 
 I to be honest with you I find th- that too much running gets pretty boring as well 
 and 
 Right
 Sure 
 Well I think they're starting to realize that 
 A lot of the like the big eight teams that used to run so much I think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore
 Right 
 Yeah
 So what's d- 
 this World League is coming in 
 that's getting ready to start up right
 Have you followed that very much 
 or 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right 
 It can take over a small market share 
 but nothing really 
 Right
 Yeah 
 I think I agree with you 
 It's it's kind of interesting to see to see their claim of you know like world football 
 But when in reality it's really Americans playing somewhere else you know 
 Yeah 
 Actually I kind of like soccer 
 I've never really played it 
 but I like the idea 
 It's it's an interesting game to watch 
 That and rugby 
 I've like to watch rugby every now and then 
 Yeah 
 whatever you want to call it there
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 there's an element there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 exactly 
 Yeah 
 Tha- 
 Yeah
 You've played it then 
 No I doubt it you know 
 Not at least not in this country anyway
 Yeah 
 It is
 They really are 
 Yeah 
 no 
 I don't 
 To tell you the truth I'm 
 Okay
 To tell you the truth I'm not even really from here
 Yeah 
 I'm I'm up here for a year on an internship
 But I I actually live in Florida
 Yeah
 Well you know who who who the heck is going to root for Tampa Bay right 
 I guess I could go for Miami 
 but I don't know 
 I'm from 
 I root for Nebraska 
 so I'm I don't have a real love for Miami anyway
 But I don't know 
 I I guess I get into pretty much
