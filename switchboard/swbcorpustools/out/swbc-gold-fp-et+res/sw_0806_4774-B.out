 Okay 
 based 
 okay 
 Good
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 So do I 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I think if it's got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing it should be for everybody
 You know when they answer the company I think it'll make it a lot easier
 and they'd run into less problems Because 
 I don't know I come from the teaching field too 
 and it sort of 
 it's a pro and a con ty- 
 I don't know where to stand on it
 I'm more or less if they told me I had to well then fine 
 but if you know if they made me then I'd probably 
 if I had my druthers I'd probably say well no
 you know just this 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think it's it's what they're basically trying to do I don't know up here in Massachusetts anyhow what they're basically trying to do is gosh any people who had di- tested positively getting them into a drug program Or rehab program
 And anybody who gee is you know di- doesn't accept the rehab program then they're more or less getting laid off
 I I think that's really hard to because you know you never know I don't know it 
 that's a 
 it's really weird issue 
 I'm sort of on the fence about it
 But I 
 you know that that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow 
 we can get you into a drug program 
 But then you wear that stigma you know 
 Where like a lot of people are saying well I only smoked a joint last night I don't have any problems you know Or something like that 
 yeah
 Right 
 Anything with an- a 
 you know if you drink a lot of caffeine or 
 Yeah 
 somebody was saying telling me if you drink it in you know an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test
 I know I'm an epileptic 
 so I'd probably test positive and and then I'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system you know 
 And a lot of times those are the things I don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you 
 You know it's very personal 
 I wouldn't want to have it disclosed because then I'd always wonder if they fired me you know why did you fire me 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It it hits me as the Orwell thing Big brother is watching 
 Orwell
 And you know his book Brig big brother is watching
 You know you're being controlled That type of deal 
 and I sh- 
 I don't really you know I don't know Seems awful strange 
 I'd hate to have to 
 if I had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didn't I'd probably take the company who didn't Because I feel there'd be more trust in the employee
 But I can understand why they need it with all the you know train accidents and everything else
 I think they will too because you know it's just going to follow
 I don't know I we haven't had any of it in our school system 
 So you know hopefully we won't 
 Right
 Well and eventually it's going to be not only the tea- 
 you know the kids are going to be under scrutiny it's going to be the teachers
 And if they can test the teachers that gives them the full right to test the kids
 And then they you know caught everybody
