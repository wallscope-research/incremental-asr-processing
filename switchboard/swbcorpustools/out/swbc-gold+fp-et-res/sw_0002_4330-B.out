 Actually uh they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting 
 because when I went to work for them uh they didn't do that 
 but uh since then they've started a drug testing policy not because of their own uh convictions but because the clients of our company requests that we do that
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Okay
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well it's actually uh 
 we do oil well services 
 So a lot of our clients are big oil companies 
 and they go out to 
 we have engineers who uh go out to the client's oil well and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff 
 so the clients are very concerned that you know the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they're on their you know territory and everything 
 but the thing that's interesting is that I'm an engineer a software engineer 
 and I work in the software uh house 
 and everybody there you know are all software engineers 
 you know they never go out to the oil rigs or anything 
 and yet we're subjected to this policy you know the same one that uh all the engineers have to 
 well a little different actually 
 but uh you know we have to go through the same thing 
 uh it's a little different I guess than a lot of drug policies 
 In our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you 
 and then if you get injured on the job if you like trip and fall or something uh they give you a drug test right away 
 Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that 
 but a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first 
 Particularly like uh we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol 
 and they didn't find any problem with that you know 
 but 
 Uh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's really bizarre 
 Uh particularly like where we are you know 
 I 
 there was a story of a woman last year who actually did slip on the ice and like sprained her ankle 
 and she was a personnel secretary 
 and she had to get tested 
 and I don't know 
 I'm ambivalent about the whole thing 
 you know I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if you know 
 they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense 
 and you know it's like employments are contractual by nature anyway
 but uh I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job where I had to uh uh do a drug test 
 and it was kind of a long story 
 but it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through 
 and it amounted to uh going in uh before any of these interviews 
 I'm not even working for this company 
 I'm going in for like interviews 
 and they flew me out to Chicago 
 and uh before I went into any of the interviews uh they took me to the doctor to give me a physical 
 They said it was going to be a physical you know 
 and uh actually beforehand they told me they were going to uh do drug screening 
 but I had forgotten about that 
 and so basically I'd already peed off in that morning 
 and when I got in there I wasn't like able to give a full sample 
 and so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again 
 and the procedure is utterly humiliating 
 You go in there with the doctor 
 he makes you take off all your clothes 
 and then he examines you
