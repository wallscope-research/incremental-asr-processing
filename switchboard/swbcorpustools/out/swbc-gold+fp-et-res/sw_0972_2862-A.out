 Well did you get a chance to watch any of the games
 Oh okay 
 Yeah
 No 
 I don't think so 
 because uh I saw just a little bit of the game today 
 and he was out there playing
 Although uh what I saw was at the end of the first quarter 
 I think he only had like eight points at the end of the first quarter 
 they thought that was big news
 So I don't know 
 but I don't know who won 
 and uh I don't know 
 who do you normally pull for the Mavericks or 
 Oh yeah
 Oh jeez 
 Yeah 
 because that's just dollars right out of the franchise
 Oh man 
 Now I've always been pulling for the Lakers for a long time
 And uh not just because they always win 
 but uh when they had uh Akeem anybody who was old as that playing that well you know I just kind of had to go with them 
 Now they kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players and uh course uh all the people that follow the Lakers and everything out there in California 
 Uh and it also helps when they were winning 
 uh I always wondered that you know 
 I will take a look at the individual score you know in the individual stance in the N B A
 and you know they have in the paper you know like fifteen different categories 
 and uh they'll have the highest scorer the top rebounders uh assists foul shooting percentages and all that 
 and you go down through 
 and virtually every one of the categories there isn't uh a Laker in the top ten 
 usually hardly anybody in the top twenty except for like Magic
 and uh yet the Lakers continue to win 
 So you're right 
 I think they do really play much better as a team than they do uh uh each one you know individually at their spot <> 
 But uh 
 Yeah
 Well I understand that uh 
 I guess Boston's really uh giving uh 
 aren't they playing Detroit <> 
 I think Boston's playing Detroit 
 and I think they're really giving them a run for their money
 Did he get hurt again
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I tell you what 
 I guess it's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy
 Yeah 
 yeah
 He ought to have his own bed come along with him you know 
 Oh yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 matter of fact I watched him uh on T V you know sink I don't know a 
 jeez it was like uh uh thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or something like that from three point range
 Unbelievable
 Oh I don't know 
 did you ever play much basketball
 Yeah
 It really is for a noncontact sport quote unquote 
 Yeah 
 really 
 Some of those guys got pretty funny looking uh eye wear
 Man
 Yeah 
 Several years ago when I was up in uh Cleveland I was staying at the Marriott 
 and the Cavaliers were playing somebody 
 I think it was like Utah or somebody like that 
 and uh I was down by the pool 
 and there was all these guys standing around about chest deep in water 
 Now I wear uh contacts 
 and I had my glasses on 
 and I went down there and just jumped into the water where they were 
 and it went right up over my head 
 and I came up spittering and sputtering for air 
 and they were all the basketball players there to play the Cavaliers
 they were all like uh like six eight and uh you know six ten 
 and they were standing in water that was like six foot you know 
 and uh it was funny I tell you 
 I saw a guy 
 I don't remember what his name was 
 but he got on the elevator 
 and he had his swimsuit on 
 and uh he was just skin and bones you know 
 it looked like something out of Africa
 and uh I made some comment 
 and uh he says yeah 
 he says I weigh about uh uh two hundred and forty pounds
 but he says it's not much when you stretch it over seven foot one
 So you're right 
 those guys really you know the big ones 
 I don't even know how much Ewing weighs 
 But uh he's got to be way up there
 God that's a lot 
 That's a lot of guy coming down on you
 Jeez 
 I didn't even see 
 who's supposed to have uh the best uh draft picks
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 I used to go down to Reunion Arena uh 
 went down there a couple years on the day of the draft
 and that was really pretty interesting 
 They usually have uh uh you know a video uh highlights of the season you know and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the Mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage both the good and the bad
 I don't know 
 I didn't go down there last year 
 but uh it was only like a couple dollars to get in 
 and it was really kind of interesting <> 
 uh so who do you thinks going to win the playoffs
 Chicago uh and let's see uh Golden State and the Lakers and Chicago and Philadelphia 
 think Chicago's playing Philadelphia 
 and then the uh 
 shoot I can't remember them all now
 Right 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 N B A playoffs 
 Philadelphia was uh favored by one point over Chicago and the Lakers one point over Golden State and Detroit by five over uh Boston <> 
 Jeez
 Think so
 I tell you what 
 those guys really hang tough
 Now I'd like to see them back up there again 
 uh they really gave some really good years uh uh of enjoyment and fun and everything 
 Have you ever been up there to Boston Garden
 Well I don't know 
 is that in 
 I haven't really gone to a lot of games live 
 but boy I'd sure like to 
 Basketball's gotten to be a lot of fun
