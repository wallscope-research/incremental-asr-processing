 Uh well yeah 
 I am as a matter of fact 
 Well actually I'm looking for another car 
 but uh uh new 
 probably not 
 Uh sports car
 Uh usually either black or red
 And electric windows and power locks 
 Now 
 Well not so much that as it is 
 I've had so many times when uh uh you know I'll have a friend next to me or I see uh guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window
 It is just a real pain 
 or you know if I'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and uh somebody that I know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive reach over and try to roll down the window
 uh so power locks power windows are just things that uh just really help a lot 
 What about you
 Oh
 Sure
 Have you ever had a car with an air bag
 No
 Well it sure seems to save lives 
 and 
 uh yeah 
 actually I like the anti-lock brakes
 And I have never had a chance to 
 I have been in cars that have had them 
 but I've never tromped on the brakes uh you know on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up
 But uh you think you'd buy uh an American car or a European or Japanese
 What was that
 Huh 
 stick shift 
 huh
 Did it have what a three speed or a four speed
 Wow
 Well actually I much prefer a stick shift 
 and what I'm curious 
 I know why I love a stick shift 
 why did you want one
 Uh-huh
 It's hard to find stick shift cars anymore
 Huh 
 yeah
 No 
 most of the sports cars are stick shift
 Huh
 Huh
 Uh I guess I grew up on it and it's fun 
 it's an enjoyable part of driving 
 I do feel like I have uh more control over the car 
 and to me it gives me more a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions
 Uh it does uh 
 I don't know 
 it's really more fun than anything 
 As long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic it's fun 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 uh of course I like gadgets and uh fun things on the cars which are all the things course the c-
