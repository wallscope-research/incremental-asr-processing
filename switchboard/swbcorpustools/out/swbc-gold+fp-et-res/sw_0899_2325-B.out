 <> No 
 I have two children 
 I have a two year old and a three and a half year old
 Really
 That's wild
 Oh boy 
 Well mine was two in March 
 and the three and a half year old will be four in July
 So that is pretty close 
 But I'm home with the kids all day 
 and I have really uh tried to make that a priority even though it's financially a big strain on us
 But 
 Pretty much 
 pretty much 
 Uh I work part-time 
 but uh my husband's able you know mostly to take care of them when I'm working 
 But uh we adopted these two little guys
 and that was another reason why I really wanted to be here because you know they have had a couple foster homes already
 The baby was eleven weeks old 
 and his brother was twenty-two months
 Yeah 
 So 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh boy 
 Yeah
 Oh that's neat 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 That's the hardest thing I think you know to deal with is that people love your kids 
 I put uh my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and you know that kind of thing 
 and uh he was in there for three months when I pulled him out 
 and the teacher had eleven kids 
 It was excellent supposedly 
 The reputation was fantastic for this place 
 Was supposed to be an excellent school 
 and I had several friends who had recommended it too 
 But it really gets down to the particular teacher
 And she was a new teacher at the school 
 and she had eleven you know three year olds in a room 
 and I just think it was way too much 
 The were almost all boys 
 Pardon
 I didn't think much 
 I don't think much
 Yeah 
 And she was just my uh 
 three year old is real active
 And she just kept saying how wild he was 
 Well you know there was kind of a connotation there of you know it being a problem 
 Like he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said 
 Well you know at three years old I don't find that to be a behavioral problem You know 
 it's kind of like there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more
 and it's really hard to con- 
 you can't control eleven three year olds with one person you know 
 Yeah you know 
 So I just finally took him out Plus financial reasons
 It was expensive 
 But I was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time 
 But I still felt like even after all the checking I did you know you really can't know everything about what's going to happen 
 I felt safe that the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them you know because there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms 
 And I felt like that was a big factor for me 
 That they would would be safe you know from any kind of abuse or that kind of thing
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh gosh 
 You had to come home and clean before you could even do anything probably
 Oh gosh 
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 I took the kids there once just to try it 
 They had a free day at Kindercare 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I didn't either 
 I had two bad experiences just that one day with medicine that my son was supposed to have for a cold that they never gave him
 And the other one was that the younger one got bit really badly by another child 
 and what they did was they took my younger one out and put him in a crib and left him in a crib the rest of the day Instead of taking the kid that was biting out and do something with him 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 So you feel like your values aren't getting 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 God loves you 
 You know basic things like that
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Wow
 Oh what luck
 Really 
 Oh that's great 
 Yeah 
 Oh really 
 Wow 
 That's okay 
 I got the dryer going in the background 
 so 
 Yeah 
 Oh that's great 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 They think it's fun 
 It's not a big you know trauma to them to learn something 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Really 
 Because sometimes it is a burden having them all day because I can't do anything with them here 
 I can't even go grocery shopping right now with the two of them because the baby is so into everything 
 and the older brother is you know running around all over the place 
 so it's hard 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 So 
 Yeah 
 I need to 
 Even for just a couple mornings a week or something to have something like that 
 so I think I'm going to look for that 
 Remind me of that now that you mention it 
 I been meaning to do that you know Because some of the churches do have them uh you know for like six dollars per child
 and that's not that big a deal you know
 For a couple times 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 That's sounds good
 Well thanks 
 Did we cover everything we need to
 Okay 
 Okay 
 Yeah 
 Okay 
 Well great 
 Well thanks a lot 
 You have a good day 
 Bye-bye
