 Yeah
 I wasn't in Central America 
 but uh talking about Latin America I consider Latin America to include Central and South America 
 and I did live in uh San Polo Brazil for four years
 Uh realistically I 
 yes 
 I don't see the Panama Canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not really big enough to uh accommodate the shipping that it once did 
 and uh maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however I think we're certainly justified in uh our actions dealing with uh Noriega in this 
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I haven't
 I have a little bit 
 I can't say that I would be an expert on on the region 
 but uh certainly uh it gets there 
 your 
 you've got this toss up betw- 
 or not so much a toss up but a dilemma when you want a country to have its um own uh dominion or its free rein over its own people 
 And then on the other hand uh uh the government in power that under what seems to be popular support uh the Sandinistas had to a given extent popular uh support um starts making overtures to the Soviet Union and into what we consider our sphere of influence 
 and now we're in this dilemma over uh United States believes in democracy and self determination where 
 but that 
 on the other hand we believe in self preservation and uh not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about uh Soviet influence in what's considered to be the United States sphere of the world which is not only we used to see spheres 
 but now we're in a situation where the United States looks like we're it now
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding uh his family
 Yeah 
 well yo- 
 in looking bu- 
 if you look at the region in uh 
 to their detriment they came from uh this uh hundreds of years of Spanish control 
 and the Spaniards have uh horrible history of corrupt uh government greedy uh rulers who have been uh manipulating their public for their own good 
 if you go back to the kings and the conquistadors coming in and the incredibly horrible things they did to uh the native tribes 
 uh they make the things that Custer did look like uh like trivial
 And uh you get 
 Oh absolutely 
 and you know we set up 
 An 
 Teddy Roosevelt didn't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick uh for nothing 
 and uh 
 Right
 the only thing I see about Cuba though is uh after Fidel Castro dies I don't think they'll be a communist power anymore 
 I can't see communism in that country carrying on past him
 Yeah
 Right
 Ye- 
 well I don't know if maybe communism is the right word for it 
 but what we would 
 there would have to be some kind of 
 there may be a point at which uh you might want to consider some kind of socialistic uh organization or socialistic set up to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy
 Right 
 right
 But cocoa leaves sell real well right now it seems 
 yeah
 Absolutely 
 I don't 
 it's going to be hard to um 
 we 
 if you 
 that's where your absolutely right is we've got to do something in that region to encourage uh or [ to make him growing bananas profitable again 
 Right
 I've got to watch what I say here 
 I never know when the D I A may be uh listening on my phone 
 Right
 yeah 
 it's tempting 
 it's got to be horribly tempting for those peasants
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 you 
 it's not just a matter uh of having an extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of feeding themselves their wife and their family 
 and you 
 there's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family 
 and there's dishonor in not being able to do it
 and 
 No 
 no
 Uh-huh
 Right
