 Right
 That's 
 Right
 Well I'm like you 
 I like to read the paper 
 but I basically don't do it every day
 and um I usually watch uh either GOOD MORNING AMERICA or the TODAY SHOW every morning while I'm you know 
 whatever I'm doing I watch that 
 I usually watch the news either at you know early evening or at ten o'clock
 so I get it from T V a lot 
 I read TIME MAGAZINE 
 Um that's one I read pretty regularly
 And uh The thing about it you know now that I've found is that we get such good coverage on T V or at least such I don't know attempted thoroughness of coverage by the time you get the TIME MAGAZINE there's nothing in it you don't know
 Right 
 Then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or something because really I've thought lately there's nothing new in the TIME MAGAZINE
 You know it's basically you've heard everything
 and uh you might get a little more thorough uh account of something 
 but really um I don't know 
 So I get most of mine from television
 I would say
 Right
 and I think there's an attempt to do that 
 You know I think people 
 there's a mild attempt for that 
 but I think we basically associate news with bad news or catastrophes or problems or crises uh you know 
 I think our concept of news isn't necessarily events that happen 
 It's more negative like you said
 But on T V I think they try to throw in good stuff 
 but uh it doesn't sway the vote
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 You know the war last winter was certainly a good example of that because we saw every single thing practically
 you know I remember well just the things that are covered
 I remember watching the World Series during the earthquake and just seeing that happen
 you know that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake and the announcers you know grabbing
 it's like that was just something because that was like live and real like you said 
 and then of course one thing I think too is with tele-
