 Did you hear our topic 
 It's in regards to discussing homes
 Yeah 
 I'm settled in a place 
 I've been in it for uh actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy-eight 
 and it's in Richardson Texas which is north Dallas 
 And we've lived in two houses in Richardson 
 We moved here in seventy-four and uh changed locations in seventy-eight
 How about yourself
 Yeah 
 it's a nice area
 Are you finding it tough trying to find what you want 
 or 
 Oh boy
 right 
 Sure
 No 
 we're settled 
 and uh we're uh 
 I'm probably older than you 
 I'm fifty-two 
 but anyway my youngest is getting married this year graduating college 
 so I can board up their rooms and look forward to retirement maybe
 Oh gosh 
 so we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere closer to our families
 No 
 from West Virginia 
 but uh my wife's parents are from the New York New Jersey area
 but everyone uh has seem to relocated down that area
 Seems like a nice place to go 
 Oh I understand
 You need very minimum four and probably five
 Right
 It's tough to find a five and six bedroom house isn't it
 Oh I know
 Seems like you get in that category you're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever 
 and that's an awful lot you know 
 Right 
 Just Matter of looking 
 right
 Lot of people in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do something 
 I had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school 
 and uh there were seven kids in her family
 And they converted the dining room and did this and that 
 but they always seemed to get along fine you know
 Oh sure
 Oh I know 
 and there's nothing harder than that 
 I always just sort of assign my wife that chore 
 then I would let her narrow it down to three or four 
 then I'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do
 Yes 
 Why certainly
 I understand that
 I'm in the uh sporting goods business 
 I'm a manufacturer's rep 
 I represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies
 who are you with
 Uh-huh
 Well great
 how was the uh 
 you say you lived in the Denver area before
 How did that compare with this area as far as housing prices
 No kidding
