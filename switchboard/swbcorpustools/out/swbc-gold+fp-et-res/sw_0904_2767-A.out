 Hi this is Judy 
 I'm from Maryland 
 and I'm in California visiting right now
 Oh okay
 I know 
 I'm sitting here going oh dear 
 Should we give it a try
 Okay 
 Okay
 Well um so 
 So so what changes have you seen 
 Well actually that's what I was thinking too
 And um you know just to jump ahead a little bit 
 but then we can back up 
 Is it perhaps woman in politics is for the future
 Because I don't see that really yet in positions of power really
 Uh-huh
 That's true 
 That's true 
 Um do you work in private corporation or government
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh you 
 That's the best status
 Yes um 
 I see um 
 and 
 A government
 And I work in academia before
 And um actually there's one um woman in our I don't know what you'd call it uh institute who is a manager 
 and in a since perhaps um she gets protected a lot because it's almost like a token
 and it's sort of unfortunate because I think that they don't accept her technically 
 but she's a good paper pusher
 And it's in a technical position really 
 And you know she should be more technical for what she does
 And I think that's sort of unfortunate because it doesn't really help the cause in the long run 
 But um you know I don't know 
 and teaching I still see that that's where most of the woman are
 In teaching 
 you know and it's always been that way
 Right 
 Not well 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Not department chairmen 
 Yeah 
 Not the deans and things like that
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Um and do you think it's because women aren't qualified or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs
 Uh-huh
 They're just not selected somehow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh okay 
 But I'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering 
 but you know I say that 
 but yet I know too
 Yeah 
 I'm sure there are yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 the two that I know obviously are not in teaching 
 but um I suppose in a since I was surprised when they told me they majored in engineering 
 I don't know why 
 but I don't know that many men that have majored in engineering either 
 because I'm in the humanities it's just 
 You know it's not something that I tend to hear about
 But um yeah 
 it's a 
 Oh that's interesting
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I suppose that it's difficult to really say why because uh you know there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified
 And maybe there aren't you know 
 Maybe they don't apply for the job
 Right 
 Right 
 Which could be you know partially cultural anyway
 So that it might be circularly being the same problem of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway
 so why spend your time getting qualified
 [ it's a rough + It's [ a rough a rough ] ] situation 
 Um and I guess what amazes me is the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids 
 and in our case we actually have one father who works part-time a six hour day so that he can take the kids or kid I'm not sure to school in the morning and be home when the children or child comes home in the afternoon
 This is uh 
 Well see I don't know anything about the family 
 but yeah 
 I would imagine she might Um 
 because you know he's a really nice guy 
 but he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job
 So that you know maybe she was more qualified 
 but still it's interesting that you know he's been doing this evidently for a good number of years
 uh but it's unusual
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I 
 Oh he was even before they had children
 Oh now that really is 
 Oh she was
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I think it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for somebody to stay home that 
 Yeah 
 That's true
 but yet you know we have to think about that 
 because if she had offered to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything stran- 
 So so we're carrying our own prejudice 
 Yeah 
 Oh gee
 I guess we can't win 
 Because if somebody does if and breaks tradition you're surprised 
 But if 
 Oh dear 
 So so 
 If they could get away with it 
 Oh dear 
 You know well uh it's an interesting topic 
 yet I must say it's not one that I've given a great deal of thought to 
 but uh in the past 
 It's um one of those things that you know seems to happen
 I don't feel for the most part that I've been discriminated against
 No 
 I was a department chairman 
 but I don't like administration
 So then I'm uh uh probably a poor example although you know I was an administrator and could still be I suppose
 Uh-huh
 Oh really 
 you were more ambitious than they would let you be
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well I would 
 Uh
 Oh jeez
 Yeah 
 actually in a since I suppose when I was hired into the government um I was taken advantage of 
 and that's true that you know sometimes other people get higher increments for you know even 
 Right
 Right 
 That's probably true 
 I hadn't thought about it because I do like what I do 
 and uh I just sort of ignore the administrative part of it since I didn't like it when I had to do it
 So I figure you know uh nobody must like it 
 It must be a rotten job for everybody 
 But I know some people thrive on it 
 Oh gee 
 Well since I don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic
