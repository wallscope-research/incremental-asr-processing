 Wendy I guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets uh if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh 
 let me ask you the question 
 do you have a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I see 
 I see 
 Well good 
 I'm kind of in a different situation 
 but I went through that too when I was in school 
 but uh I was working to get through college and uh trying to make it through that 
 but uh I'm married and have uh a couple of children 
 and we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget 
 I'm on a salary 
 so I don't get any overtime or anything like that 
 but We have a fixed income 
 and we have to make sure that uh every dollar we have is spent accordingly 
 and uh what we try and do to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have you know the house payment 
 we have the insurance premiums uh utilities and so forth 
 and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside 
 and we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the kids' college education the future and uh set aside money for bonds 
 and we also set aside an emergency fund 
 because uh we've been married for about ten years 
 and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh not enough to go and to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for
 And uh then we have you know 
 whatever's left over is yeah discretionary income that we use for the rest of the month 
 and it's worked out very well 
 uh it's helped us so that we haven't been you know too long on the month and too short on the money and uh try and stick with that 
 and nice thing about it my wife is excellent in that we both work together 
 we both have a budget 
 and we stick to it
 and there's no surprises in that 
 Well actually I have four kids
 So 
 yeah 
 I said a couple of kids 
 I guess I should have specified 
 I have four little boys 
 yeah
 You bet
 You bet
 All right 
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Well good 
 good
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 well what year are you in in college
 You're a sophomore 
 so you have a few more years
 Uh-huh 
 well good for you 
 Good for you 
 Yeah 
 I imagine it uh is a little difficult to stick with a budget during that during school and so it forth
 Yes 
 Well great 
 great 
 And sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on too
 Lab fees and all 
 Oh yes 
 oh yes 
 Well you're not a starving artist yet are you
 Good
 Well good
 there's enough of those in the world huh
 Good 
 good 
 I'm glad to hear that Wendy 
 W- 
 who's not very well educated
 Oh yes 
 yes
 That's true 
 that's true 
 I found that out
 So that's why I'm planning and preparing for the uh education of my children also try and set that money aside
 I majored in business administration
 Yeah 
 but uh once again
