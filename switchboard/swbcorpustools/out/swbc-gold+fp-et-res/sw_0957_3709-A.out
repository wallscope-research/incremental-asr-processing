 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 They set that up for you
 Uh-huh
 And uh what kind of running do you do
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 is just aerobics 
 or 
 No 
 uh I mean the running
 you do a mile in about eight minutes or less
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 then you don't get uh out of breath
 Oh
 Oh
 But it's not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make six or something like that
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I don't run much any more 
 I did when I was in school
 Right now I just lift uh weights and do push ups and sit ups
 and I uh jump rope a little bit
 and that is about it 
 And I don't lift any heavy weight uh 
 they are about a third of my body weight
 Yeah 
 and uh uh I play the trumpet 
 and the uh the more upper body strength the easier it is to play
 You have to do a whole lot of sit ups 
 uh and then uh I hurt my neck uh about three years ago
 So you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from uh hurting yourself when you play high
 you have to do it correctly you know 
 it is like an exercise in itself 
 but a lot of people uh strain themselves doing it
 Uh I play at Church
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well yeah 
 uh well the weather is nice except for when it rains you know in Dallas
 Yeah 
 I keep thinking about it 
 but that doesn't mean it gets done 
 I mostly jump rope more
 You know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I do a toe lift and squats for that 
 But you know it [ doesn't uh doesn't ] uh accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you are running for a long time
 They tend to tighten up whenever you have to do something at uh uh great length of time
 And it also builds too much mass if you just you know 
 So I lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do the squats with
 And uh then it doesn't bother me very much
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 uh I have started doing more push ups 
 and it has helped a lot 
 and then I add sets to it so that I don't like you said wear it out 
 I don't try to push it so the end in one set
