 Boy I don't know 
 that's a tough one 
 Uh uh and uh I suppose it's changes uh as my perception changes of what uh I'm getting gypped on 
 and 
 this month uh uh uh uh uh well there's a couple of changes to uh our health plan 
 uh and I guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance 
 but uh If I step back I'm not sure I'd uh say that 
 what about you
 Oh okay
 Yes 
 okay
 but on the other hand one of these days you'll be out looking for a 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right 
 okay
 and yeah 
 and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars a semester uh you never use because you just use your wife's
 Uh yeah 
 that's a negative about uh where I am in that uh well uh I worked five years civil service 
 and there they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that or hours per pay period or something 
 but anyway it works out as I remember basically to uh 
 you start at uh two and a half weeks or something like that 
 and at three years uh it goes to four weeks I believe 
 and I've been at T I now uh uh coming up on fifteen years 
 and uh this year is going to go to four weeks here 
 so 
 Uh uh
 Yeah 
 [ that's a + that is a negative uh but probably not a deciding factor 
 but uh 
 Yeah
 Well that 
 yeah 
 that's the thing is how flexible they are for comp time kinds of things 
 and uh uh that's the uh 
 yeah 
 That's why it hasn't made all that much difference is because with the civil service that you could take your vacation in increments of one hour
 but uh there wasn't uh anything as far as comp time 
 so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year uh you know an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing
 Uh whereas uh here uh things are free enough that uh the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that much different 
 uh But uh 
 Yeah 
 I think the health insurance 
 I think that's going through changes everywhere to uh 
 they've uh uh gone through a couple years ago here where they uh will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals 
 and now they're in the process of developing a list of uh designated doctors uh 
 so that just routine visits uh they will compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors
 which uh 
 my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since uh he keeps real busy without having to uh 
 Yeah
 Well and I think in the much bigger picture than uh to some extent hospitals and doctors have some uh fixed amount 
 and if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to uh uh you know give you these rates and make this agreement then uh you're not covered by that 
 and the added costs get passed on to you 
 so uh I'm not sure 
 uh one of the phrases I use is that it's moving towards uh private socialized medicine That uh in terms of the negatives always heard in terms of socialized medicine you have no choice on who you go to for a doctor and things like that uh where it's the government that decides 
 here it's uh 
 Yeah 
 uh the effect is the same as the 
 you uh get left out of the loop more 
 I know that their uh idea is that uh if you have to pay a bigger share you'll be more careful about spending the money and helping hold down the costs
 but uh I don't know 
 in terms of uh the health care I uh find that uh although I've been lucky enough to never have any big problems that uh the cost is not a big factor 
 I want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and
