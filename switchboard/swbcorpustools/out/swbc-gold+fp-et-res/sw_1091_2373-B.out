 Was I supposed to do something
 Good 
 Uh let's see 
 so uh were we right in the Middle East
 Should we have been there
 Did we do what was correct there
 Should we have fought them harder 
 Used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used
 Oh you agree with Schwartzkopf who says uh Drive on into Baghdad
 Would that be so bad 
 Was there anything there to begin with
 It wasn't ours
 We've got to talk so it's just as well we argue
 I agree
 Wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country
 Yeah 
 So other political things that's going on 
 I heard President Bush say that he uh wanted to improve the highways
 Oh he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country
 But wouldn't it be wonderful
 And back east you all drive at fifty-five don't you 
 What's that
 Oh okay um 
 I say back east you all drive at fifty-five don't you
 See out here in the west a lot of our secondary roads are fifty-five
 we drive sixty-five
 Oh yes
 Well I uh last weekend went home to visit my parents 
 My dad's in the hospital
 And uh between here and west Texas there was probably three and four hours at sixty-five miles an hour
 Nonstop 
 Have you ever been out here
 How far west have you been
 Oh you've never You've never seen the great American desert
 The Rocky Mountains
 Yellowstone
 Uh
 Well my college educa- uh thirty-six 
 worked for Texas Instruments for seventeen or eighteen now
 Uh know virtually nothing else
 Uh yeah 
 I got my B S in General Science
 Yeah 
 I know 
 it's a funny degree 
 Anyway uh I know nothing other than the west
 In fact uh down in east Texas where the company's located there's streams and water and things I don't understand Trees and the gulf 
 and it's really interesting
 So tell me about where you live
 Uh how high is the highest elevation
 Like uh probably 
 three thousand feet
 Close to sea level
 Okay 
 uh right here in Colorado Springs where I live it's over six thousand foot
 Um yes 
 when I lived in Texas every year I had to drive you know 
 I drove every year to the gulf 
 and you know so I could have a feast of fresh seafood six eight twelve hours away You know just for fresh 
 I'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of America
 How many hours have you been from home
 Yes
 Oh yeah
 Uh now when I was growing up in the Panhandle of Texas 
 look at your map later and see the town of Amarillo fifty miles north of that up in the Panhandle 
 To just go buy a pair of jeans we'd drive an hour
 When I was growing up Now things are different 
 and people buy jeans in town 
 but uh we thought nothing at all of waking up in the morning hopping into your car grabbing the fishing poles and driving four hours
 Yeah 
 It is I imagine
 Okay
 Okay 
 I'll look at my map later
 Wow 
 How neat
 So are you working your way through college
 Well how neat 
 What's your major
 Finance
 Well that's interesting
 So uh what do you plan to do with it
 Savings and loans uh
 Oh that would be great 
 That would be neat 
 Let's see uh so we're all excited in Colorado Springs
 Apple Computer is coming to town
 Yes 
 The uh new employer is in the city
 So we're expecting our local economy to Well maybe not a boom but uh at least recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still
 Uh unemployment runs approximately six percent
 But now under employment I would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent
 And the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree
 Yes 
 It is
