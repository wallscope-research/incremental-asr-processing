 Uh do you have a pet Randy
 A poodle miniature or uh full size
 Uh-huh
 I read somewhere that the poodles is one of the most intelligent dogs uh around
 Oh uh-huh 
 So you've only known the dog how long did you say
 Oh well uh is it 
 uh uh how old is the dog
 Oh it's still just a pup
 Yeah 
 I have a uh well a mutt myself 
 I call it a uh uh Chowperd 
 It's uh part Chow and part Shepherd 
 and it 
 as I understand it uh both sides of the were thoroughbreds 
 So she's a genuine Chowperd 
 She has the color and the black tongue of a Chow 
 but uh she has the shape of the uh uh Shepherd
 Oh she weighs in at about fifty pounds 
 so she's a medium size
 But she's big enough to be intimidating *[[ Seems that this should end in a slash since A's next turn is an indep clause ]] it is a fixed female by the way
 *[[ see note above ]] and right from day one she was teaching me/
 She's the most intelligent dog I've ever seen 
 Course I'm a little prejudiced of course
 You know the first time I brought her home she was only uh was it six weeks old 
 And I spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area
 But uh next morning she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom
 So on next night I spread the newspaper in the bathroom 
 and she used them there
 But it wasn't too long until she uh found out she could wait until I let her out in the morning
 And since then I live alone
 and uh I live in motor home 
 by the way I'm uh an full time R Ver 
 and it's such a pleasure to come home at night 
 and you can see her smiling from ear to ear she's so happy to see me
 And uh I don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not
 Uh-huh
 Well my dog's an outdoor type she does not like to be indoors
 *[[ 2 slash units ]] Uh she'd rather sleep outside on the cold ground at night
 But uh I do make her come in
 And I feed her indoors that's to lure her in 
 but during the day I have her uh on a leash which is uh on sort of a run 
 I have a thirty foot cable running from one stake to another 
 and then attached to that is a uh twelve foot leash
 so she can cover quite an area
 And uh she's the best uh burglar alarm going
 Oh yeah 
 she uh 
 it's the strangest thing though uh children no matter how strange they are or how new they might be can walk uh right up to her
 but adults if they're strange to her or they look suspicious or something boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off
 And I have not discovered yet where the line is between children and adults
 But uh she is a great comfort to me
 Uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh
 You mean she didn't appreciate all that attention/
 Uh-huh 
 What's her name by the way
 what do you call the dog
 Mitzi
 Mine is Gin
 As in uh martini
 Actually it's Gin two
 Because uh when I was a teenager in high school I had Gin one 
 but then when I went out in the world I couldn't take her with me
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 Oh what a shame
 Uh-huh 
 oh well
 Well Randy we've just about used up our time here
 and I must say it was interesting
 I enjoyed talking about pets with you
 Maybe we'll get together again in the future
 Take care now
 Bye
