 Right
 Oh
 how way back 
 Okay 
 so Wally Moon moon shots and all that
 Yeah 
 coliseum Wally Moon and all that
 Okay 
 yeah 
 it's a um 
 I'm living just west of Baltimore and Frederick um which is also just west of Baltimore has a minor league team 
 uh and Wally Moon is the manager of them
 Yeah 
 so he's still kicking around
 Oh I saw them 
 um um I was out there last Summer 
 and I saw a game at Ned Skelton 
 Is that the stadium
 Oh okay 
 So um there used to be a uh race track
 Yeah 
 it was 
 that was impression I got when I was there 
 so 
 Okay 
 yeah 
 so had a lot of fun 
 actually I like minor league baseball a lot 
 It's cheaper for one thing 
 Yes 
 I think they're in for a odd year this year 
 actually um they um 
 I don't understand why Encovilla got released
 you know he can't field 
 and you know he strikes out a lot 
 but he's done that for five years 
 Why get rid of him now
 Oh yes 
 Okay
 Oh okay
 Oh he fits right in with Detroit bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot
 Yeah 
 well with Detroit they can get away with one guy like that 
 if I were in Detroit I would start building the team around Fielder
 But that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit all they can do is hit home runs and strike out you know which they did
 So 
 I think the pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter
 I like them a lot 
 I think they're going to go all the way 
 Um and by saying I like them I like their chances 
 I actually don't like the Dodgers 
 I'm a Giants fan from way back
 No 
 but Butler didn't hurt either 
 Uh and Bobby Ojeda didn't hurt 
 and 
 Bobby Ojeda 
 They got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks
 Um he's a pretty decent pitcher 
 He's 
 Okay 
 you know he 
 And uh that guy the short stop is going to be good
 Um
 Yeah 
 I'm looking 
 I've already been to one game 
 and I should have been to two 
 but 
 Um the team I live and die with actually is the Red Sox mostly die 
 but um I go to the Orioles since they're here 
 and you know I do enjoy them
 Um I've had an opening day on Monday
 How far is Houston
 Oh okay 
 keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes
 Yeah 
 I um 
 you know we're pretty lucky because if I want to see a National League team I can usually go up to Philadelphia
 And um saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year and a bunch of teams the year before
 Okay 
 uh yeah 
 Um I try to see whatever I can 
 I've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years
 Yeah 
 hope I'm going to do it this year because um uh having a kid this fall 
 so it's like so much for going to lots of baseball games
 Yeah 
 seriously
 Yeah 
 good talking with you 
 and you'll be happy I think in October when the Dodgers win
 Yeah 
 I'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right 
 And good talking with you 
 Take care
 Bye
