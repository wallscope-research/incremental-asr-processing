 Yes 
 I have had a number of them in my lifetime 
 and I've 
 I am a Golden retriever fan
 but I had to replace it with something that the kids could carry
 Yes 
 Yes
 Yes 
 well they were 
 they really wanted something teeny tiny 
 and I uh really wanted that retriever's disposition Uh the ultimate to tolerant trainable disposition
 so I called four or five dog trainers because I don't like the little dogs
 and I asked them you know these are the ages of the kids what do I get
 And they all said Golden Retriever 
 and I said okay put it under twenty pounds 
 And the only thing that they could come up with was a Bichon Frize which is a 
 Do you know what that is
 They're cute 
 They look like an air headed let me tell you 
 They're calm they're not yuppie they're trainable they're uh very personable in a different way that a Golden Retriever is 
 They're not dignified like a retriever can be
 Yeah 
 So how old is your retriever
 Well actually you know that's the breed standard for females 
 What you 
 yeah 
 what you see shown and bred now as Golden Retrievers this you know plus eighty to a hundred pound range/
 That is not breed standard
 Fifty-five is the minimum 
 but they usually run about sixty to sixty-five 
 And the ones that are shown they are inside that weight allowance
 You cannot show your retriever if it's you know a hundred plus pounds
 So don't say she's small just say she's perfect
 Uh-huh
 Yep
 Well they are the ultimate dog to have around kids so long as your kid is not scared of a big dog because I had a retriever actually I had a retriever Irish Setter cross Which is a really nice animal 
 and fortunately it was just like a retriever 
 and then I've had a retriever
 It was gorgeous 
 It was just gorgeous just gorgeous
 Um and they both you know 
 both the half breed and the pure breed had uh what I consider the the perfect disposition 
 But you know what scares me about Golden Retrievers
 Since they've become so popular you get what I call backyard breeders Which is probably where yours came from People that don't know what they're doing and they breed them you know for a certain characteristic 
 And in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big for somehow big is perceived as the better 
 And when you start doing that you really tamper with you know all the years of uh culling litters 
 and uh you tamper with what the dog innately is
 We w- 
 when I was 
 when I bought my last purebred retriever I looked all over because I wanted one that still looked like a retriever you know the short to the ground stocky golden uh trainable tractable quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house 
 And I ended up getting one that uh came out of a hunting stock because I wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did 
 And I've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb retrievers 
 and I'm and I really fear for the breed because I love that breed
 but I really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined
 Oh yeah
 You bet you 
 You bet you 
 You know how they came up with the retriever don't you the Golden
 It was bred out of several different retrievers 
 and they bred it for companionship and uh uh disposition and ability to hunt 
 It was kept only by kings
 But they selectively culled those litters for many hundreds of years 
 and since it slept in the castle with its master it had to be of a disposition to make it you know an animal you could keep around that closely 
 But they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect 
 Now you know that seems like a cruel thing to do
 On the other hand you know they sure created a wonderful breed a wonderful breed
 Uh-huh
 Well I tell you you know the German shepherd is the classic case of what I'm talking about because in America that's called a Rin Tin Tin phenomena
 Only in America is there a dog called a German Shepherd
 That dog is bred out of three European dogs The Belgian Tervurien a German Skutzhund and a <> I always forget the third one I can see it 
 Uh uh i- 
 but the third one is a children's dog
 And there are distinct breeds in Europe 
 Now what happened over here was is that people saw the first um which would actually have been a Skutzhund which is what Rin Tin Tin was
 And everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin
 And it was known as a German shepherd here 
 So they created a breed standard The American Kennel Club did
 That said anything that is a Skutzhund a Tervurien and uh that's the other one Alsatian any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here
 And what happened is is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect 
 And they bred a dog that it's called an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you
 That German shepherd the American German Shepherd here was such an unreliable animal that the American Seeing Eye Institute refused to use them because they would turn on their handlers
 And even um uh police corps which started you know finding other breeds to use because this thing known as a German shepherd here its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible 
 So about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this 
 So they went back to Europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred to a standard what they wanted an American German shepherd to be Which is a very heavily now Skutzhund and Alsatian 
 and it's the Alsatian that's the kid's dog 
 It's just 
 you see them in Europe 
 and they're just lovely
 But you'll see 
 if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for German Shepherds they will say on them bred for disposition A K C conforming which means that their advertising that this is no longer an indiscriminate dog 
 This is bred for 
 and they had to go through and destroy for a while there about seventy-five percent of their puppies that they bred
 Because they were looking for this disposition 
 And nowadays you'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific you know breeder handler 
 They will recommend their shepherds as a children's dog
 But
