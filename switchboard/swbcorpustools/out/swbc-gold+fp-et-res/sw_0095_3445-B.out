 Which is movies 
 correct
 Okay 
 Um yeah 
 I don't like going to see them in the theaters 
 but outside of that rent a lot 
 watch them on T V mostly
 Uh I don't know um 
 actually earlier tonight we were watching TO LIVE AND DIE IN L A 
 Have you seen that movie
 It's a kind of one of those psycho ones
 Oh it's not too bad 
 One of those cop thrillers 
 but 
 Yes 
 we do
 Uh no 
 I haven't yet
 Yeah 
 that 
 He's a good actor though
 Um Gene Hackman's a good actor I think 
 Do you see HOOSIERS
 Yeah 
 actually we saw her just the other night too
 Yeah 
 It's one of our favorite movies 
 I live with um a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us 
 We've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I like those movies that you watch time and time again
 I'm an electrical engineer
 I work in Massachusetts actually
 Um it's only about um half an hour 
 I live on the border
 That's right
 See we live up in tax free New Hampshire and drive down to Massachusetts to work
 Yeah 
 I grew up in New Hampshire 
 It seems southern town 
 it's called Portsmouth 
 It's I don't know fifteen minutes from the Mass- border and five minutes from the main border 
*[[main = Maine]] We live right in the corner
 That one little spot in New Hampshire we have ten miles of coastline 
 I live on that little ten mile spot
 Not up um where I live 
 but further down the coast in Massachusetts they got hit pretty bad
 Um well I'm only twenty-seven years old 
 so THE DOORS movie that's out on video I want to watch that
 That would be pretty good 
 No 
 I haven't seen that one
 I'm in for it 
 We rent a lot of movies 
 so we often sit around and say what movies should we rent
 And we don't know 
 All right 
 we'll try that one
 Yeah 
 I did
 You too
 I think we're going to have a white Christmas up here just like the song says
