 Okay 
 So What kind of experience do you have then with child care
 Does it say something
 Okay 
 <> Well Does it usually make a recording or s-
 Okay
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 I have three
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I do 
 Yes uh 
 I don't work though 
 but I used to work when I had two children
 I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit 
 but I don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care
 But does your sister live in a big community
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 How lucky 
 I know a lot of people around here sometimes have like mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids 
 but the community I'm in is not a real large one 
 so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that you know 
 you either know them or know somebody who knows them to get to 
 Yeah 
 to get references and that 
 but uh 
 I don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center simply because there's so many kids and so many 
 Yeah 
 and uh you know colds and things like that get spread real easy and things 
 and they're expensive 
 and course there's a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things 
 Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that 
 but 
 take a long time to find the right place 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 when he starts toddling around and stuff
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 It would be hard 
 I think it would be kind of stressful 
 It would be nice to have him around
 but uh seems like you know 
 goll- 
 what if he cried at the wrong time 
 or the phone rang you know at the wrong time 
 But 
 Uh-huh 
 Well when you have kids will you work 
 Do you work now
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh yeah 
 Actually I teach my kids at home 
 so I'm here all the time
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 So 
 Not 
 it depends on the state you live actually 
 Some laws absolutely prohibit it 
 Some states uh say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that 
 Our state doesn't yet say that 
 and I'm not a certified teacher 
 I went to college 
 you know but my kids are only elementary levels right now 
 and so 
 One of them was for a couple of years 
 and so you know my oldest he was 
 and then my youngest two have never been
 So anyway 
 but we don't
