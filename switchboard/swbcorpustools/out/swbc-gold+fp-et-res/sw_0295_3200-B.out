 No 
 I never keep a budget 
 My budget or philosophy I guess is spend as little as possible
 uh and it's sort of always worked
 Uh but that depends you know on the individual if they can I guess have self-control
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Well yeah 
 I couldn't probably be bothered doing that every month 
 and ever since 
 uh well we've been married almost thirty years now 
 but uh my husband got paid once a month
 So you learn to get 
 Right 
 You learn to get through you know to the end of the month 
 and uh 
 No
 No 
 Because if you charge things uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid 
 or you get paid the last day or next to the last day
 You pay all your bills 
 and there isn't anything left to spend anyway
 *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] Well yeah 
 we tried to 
 we are paying them off now
 Uh there was a time when maybe we didn't take all of them off
 but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is
 And for most of uh 
 I'm a substitute teacher 
 and I've only substituted I guess for the last fifteen years
 so there's only been really one working
 And uh it works for me 
 but I can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 it is when you do it that way
 Well we eat out a good deal at this point
 I started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money because I knew that you couldn't you know spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever 
 We were going to go for ten weeks uh in nineteen eighty 
 so I started working in nineteen eighty-seven and just saved for three years 
 But the 
 what minuscule amount I made 
 but that way you just didn't put it on your credit card
 and it was paid for
 Yes
 And so I think that that's difficult for most people 
 but then my father was very Scotch 
 and you know you never could afford anything although we could afford everything if he wanted to Um
 Yes
 And I never worried about saving money because we're in the savings plan at work 
 and they took it out 
 so 
 I uh 
 Uh-huh
 Well we never had too much of that
 but then we never had any really emergencies that uh 
 And we didn't buy really new or expensive cars 
 I think the most we're looking at cars now uh we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars
 And they were mainly used cars
 Yeah 
 so 
 you know we've been rather frugal In that respect
 So 
 Well each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please uh
