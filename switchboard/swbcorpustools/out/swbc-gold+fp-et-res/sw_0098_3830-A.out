 Hello
 How you doing
 I'm Lee with uh uh 
 I'm over here in Plano Texas
 Oh sure
 Oh
 Where are you calling from 
 or where are you at
 Arlington
 Well there's a lot of stuff going on in Arlington these days
 Are you involved in any of that
 No
 Well uh what benefits do 
 now do you work
 Oh you are
 Okay
 Yeah
 Because I work for myself
 and so uh there's a lot that I guess I do miss uh a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation 
 I miss uh insurance and uh the steady paychecks that come
 But uh 
 Oh is that right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 uh I own part of a roofing company
 in the Dallas Fort Worth area
 And uh you know unfortunately we were part of a bigger company
 and we had all the benefits there 
 and I do miss that You know 
 but uh on the other hand uh I enjoy having the time that I have with my family and being able to you know work when I want 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Oh is that right
 Yeah
 It's 
 Yeah
 it 
 Yeah 
 I'll tell you what 
 that is the single most uh benefit that I enjoyed and I do miss 
 because I looked into picking up some uh medical insurance just for my family you know 
 and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it
 And uh yeah
 Oh yeah
 even at a group rate 
 Uh it's unbelievable 
 and uh the amount that you have to pay you know for kids 
 and if you want to add dental to it that eats even more
 So yeah 
 I guess the other benefits uh that I miss I guess is uh you know some of the bonuses and stuff that goes on with just being involved with a big company you know 
 and course these days you can't count on that because 
 uh you know I feel bad for the people that are involved in that uh G M deal there in in Arlington 
 and I'm sure it will be you know quite a few people are affected by that 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Is that right
 The union 
 yeah
 Is that right
 Yeah
 Well 
 really the 
 Yeah 
 really the ones it's going to hurt is actually the businesses around in that area
 You know that's the ones that's going to hurt because they depend on that uh
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well I'll tell you I've had my fill of unions 
 I 
 Oh yeah
