 And I guess the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party if we wanted to do something like that or share recipes or something um
 Are you one who gives dinner parties very often
 No 
 nor am I
 They are a lot of work 
 that is for sure
 Yes
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 yes
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's great 
 You sound like my mother who has been 
 well I bake pies too 
 but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family 
 and she has the same technique 
 I guess after many years of doing it you just kind of do it second nature 
 Uh
 She enjoyed it huh 
 Well there is a woman in our choir who is nearly famous for her apple pies
 and uh we had an auction one time at the church 
 and uh one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars 
 Well I think I have had it once 
 and it has been a few years ago 
 but I do recall that it was quite good 
 so uh 
 Yeah 
 So that is her specialty uh 
 I like to bake uh also 
 I do not bake so much now that my children are grown 
 but I do enjoy baking 
 and I guess I always liked making uh cookies and bars and things like that 
 that was more my specialty I suppose 
 And they seem to last longer than pies around here 
 pies would go practically in a day's time 
 Yes
 Right 
 And 
 Well it is interesting that 
 yesterday I had lunch with a friend 
 and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend for friends of hers 
 For um uh 
 one of her acquaintances one of her old friends I guess had been in town 
 and uh they invited two other couples over 
 and so there were seven of them that uh 
 I said "well what did you have" 
 and she said what she had uh just Mexican food 
 but you know she had uh uh guacamole 
 and uh I cannot remember all she had 
 But she also had made uh flan which is actually Spanish I think 
 Have you ever made that or had it
 uh it's um 
 I had used to work with a gentleman who was from Cuba who would make it uh 
 it's just a wonderful dessert 
 It's like uh an egg custard in a caramelized sugar with on top of it 
 And it's actually not very difficult to make 
 but it's very very high in cholesterol I am sure with all the eggs that are in it
 But uh she said that she and her husband had uh traveled in Spain a couple years ago 
 and flan is almost uh a basic with every meal that you get there 
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 It's just very customary to get flan 
 So if you ever run into that you will sort of be aware of what that is all about 
 But uh I would never have thought of making that as part of a Mexican dinner 
 but you know sopapillas I guess would be another kind of a dessert if you decided to do something like that 
 But 
 flan is something you can make ahead and you know have ready 
 but uh Well I would have been thinking I would like to have a dinner party sometime soon 
 but I tell you it 
 th- 
 I 
 my 
 it's one of those things where it does require some real uh planning 
 and it's you know 
 you don't just make the dinner 
 you have the house to clean and you know the whole business that goes with it
 Yeah
 Probably a good way to do it 
 Oh the house needs cleaning I guess I had better have a dinner party 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Good heavens 
 Uh
 Oh wow
 That is such a nice thing 
 it's 
 I you know 
 until 
 well we have 
 my husband and I have been married twenty six years 
 and until last year I had never had another person clean my house 
 and then I got so involved and so busy I said "this is one luxury I am going to let myself have every now and then" 
 And so I had a woman come in uh once a month 
 and you know it was not just very often 
 but for me it was wonderful 
 Well 
 it is 
 and it buys you time to do other things like have a dinner party I guess 
 So it is just a real gift of time as far as I am concerned
 but well uh I 
 Uh-huh
 I have heard about that
 but I have never tried it
 No 
 well I should say I have heard of one that has vinegar in it 
 I do not know that it has egg in it
 uh-huh 
 Do you have it right on the top of you head 
 You do not have it 
 yeah 
 I would 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh quite large 
 yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh what is it about the uh the vinegar that uh makes the crust better
 Uh
 Interesting
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 boy that's the real secret
 Oh th- 
 it makes me think of years ago uh when I was visiting my mother-in-law in uh Michigan 
 she lived very near an apple orchard 
 and we just had 
 we could take as many apples as we wanted from it 
 Accor- 
 you know according to the owners 
 and so I decided to bake about four pies ahead you know and freeze them
 well talk about working with big amounts of pie crust and having it be tough 
 Those were the toughest apple uh pie crust I have ever ever made
 It was terrible 
 I could have used that recipe 
 it sounds like 
 Where about
 Well we lived in Plymouth for four years uh
 Yeah 
 In fact we were there from uh seventy three to seventy seven 
 and I worked for the weekly newspaper there the Plymouth oh what was it called CRIER 
 And uh my husband is from the upper peninsula 
 so he was born and raised up there
 That is where my mother-in-law still lives 
 so uh Are you originally from Michigan 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 I will be darn
