 Oh I just sort of blanking tonight 
 I just got done saying I just saw one uh fairly recently 
 Uh oh gosh oh I know uh uh the one with the two girls that take off from uh uh across the country on a crime spree
 THELMA AND LOUISE 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 it really is 
 it's interesting
 Oh yeah 
 I enjoyed it 
 I was going to go see uh the Billy Crystal movie also which was 
 I'm a little bit behind 
 I usually rent them 
 Oh this is the 
 uh just the one oh 
 gosh 
 it was the uh CITY SLICKERS 
 right
 Have you seen that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I've heard lots of good things about it 
 and I would have liked to have seen it 
 but I was with my wife 
 and I figured she'd like THELMA AND LOUISE better 
 so 
 And I'd heard it was really good too 
 so 
 No
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 there's been a fair number of pretty good movies out recently
 it kind of runs in in batches 
 for a while sometimes they come in a whole bunch of them that just I don't even you know doesn't even sound like something I want to see
 what kind of movies in general do you like to watch
 Uh-huh
 No 
 in fact I'm not even familiar with it 
 I don't think
 Uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh 
 <> No 
 in fact I'll look for it because I 
 Actually yeah 
 my wife's from down in that region called the Seven Missions which are right down where I'm sure where it was filmed at
 And uh I'm sure that that would make it worth her watching 
 She 
 uh my movie watching uh has changed a lot since I got married
 Yeah 
 she likes uh action movies and comedies 
 and so anything has anything little bit less than sort of mainstream Hollywood is boring to her 
 [ And + and so [ I used to watch a fair number of foreign films 
 I used to watch a lot of sort of the less popular films
 And I find I don't do it anymore or else I have to watch them on my own
 Find something both of you will watch
 She 
 it's funny because most women aren't really 
 she's sort of Schwarzenegger fan type of
 Yeah 
 she really likes all these gory shoot them up films
 Keep her on the edge of her seat
 I'll watch them you know 
 they're kind of fun to watch in a way
 But uh so it varies 
 I don't seem to get you know as much variety these days lately as I used to
 Well yeah 
 on the other hand you know given that my wife likes those say I occasionally like to watch them 
 and uh you know so you can always count on her to watch something like that 
 And she'll even watch things like karate movies and stuff like that You know which most women now won't 
 they won't come within ten feet of all the ya All the sounds of the karate chops flying through the air 
 A-cha 
 I s- 
 yeah 
 I speak several uh 
 but I don't mind watching subtitle movies Uh
 No 
 I 
 Yeah
 for some people that's just you know that's out of the question you know 
 You give it subtitles they won't watch
