 Okay 
 did you vote in the last uh national election
 Oh that's good
 I voted in the last national one 
 Yeah 
 I'm not sure 
 *[[slash error; one utt with next]] if I got the last local one 
 Yeah 
 you're not sure where to go and vote and all that
 Right 
 or you don't know you know where they stand or anything like that
 Yeah 
 I think you're right
 Yeah 
 or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates 
 so they think well you know why vote
 Yeah 
 really 
 especially in Texas 
 It really was 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 Did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if you know not enough people are voting
 Yeah 
 it's kind of like in Louisiana where that uh guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected
 Kind of scary when you think about that
 Oh gosh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 people will sit home and assume oh that guy would never get elected
 Next thing you know you've got him
 Yeah
 Right yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 he sure did
 Yeah 
 I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days or you could mail it in or something like if you have real strict work hours and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long
 I think that discourages a lot of people
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'm in Dallas 
 and they're long here too
 Yeah 
 I voted absentee one year 
 I really was going to be gone 
 So I did it 
 but uh it was nice 
 I would be tempted to do it again
 Right
 Yeah 
 I think they should change the whole system so that it's easier
 I think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that would be 
 I usually vote 
 A lot of times I'll vote a straight party ticket just because I don't take the time to find out you know other than the major candidates what they stand for on what issues 
 so I'll just trust well the party kind of goes along these lines so I'll go ahead and vote
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 No 
 I guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything
 Right 
 and try to determine if what you read was objective or not
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think it could affect the outcome you know could make it unfair
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 the press has a lot of power
 Yeah 
 oh but boy you try get into that 
 you'd really open a can of worms
 Yeah 
 seems that they should regulate themselves a little bit 
 and I don't think they ever care to
 Well I can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting to talk about
 Well it was good talking to you
 Bye
