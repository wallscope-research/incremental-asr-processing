 Well uh a little bit uh 
 nothing overly strenuous 
 No 
 the majority of my camping experience is uh a tent by the lake type situation or uh maybe a canoe trip or something like that
 Oh it's 
 we've had a lot of fun uh 
 I moved to Dallas about five years ago 
 and we've made three different trips since I've been here The group of friends that I run around with of varying degrees uh of difficulty 
 the last one we did and we haven't had a chance to duplicate uh was a canoe trip in Arkansas 
 and the river it was up about three feet 
 so it was pretty challenging
 uh and then we uh 
 as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and uh uh find a clearing in the woods and go for it
 Well yeah 
 yeah 
 it's the 
 that particular one was a two day trip 
 so what uh 
 uh there's a outfitter 
 and uh they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you spend the night 
 and then uh the second day head on down to the pool at the end of the river
 Yeah 
 it really is
 Okay
 Okay
 Right 
 right
 Okay
 Boy I bet 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 uh that's always been our next step 
 our little group of friends here we've been kind of getting married off and what not 
 but uh 
 Yeah 
 that 
 well it just puts a damper on things for a little while
 But we're starting to get everybody back together 
 Yeah 
 we'd like to do a float trip down uh oh like Big Bend area or something like that
 No 
 no 
 we haven't made that trip yet
 I'll bet 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 exactly
 Um not really just yet 
 We've uh 
 well I do have uh a little bit of property 
 I grew up in South Dakota
 and I've got a piece of property in Minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet 
 uh there's a little lake up there 
 and uh a group of friends that I went to college with um got together 
 and we basically own all the land around this little lake there 
 it's divided up into ten lots
 So we've got a private lake 
 and it's completely undeveloped at this point 
 so that's a possibility 
 And the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime 
 it's about two hours north of Minneapolis
 So uh yeah 
 in fact uh uh 
 well I got married last summer 
 and uh that's 
 we ended up there for a couple days uh on our honeymoon 
 We kind of took uh a tour of the United States for about a week and uh up through that area 
 But uh my wife's real excited about it 
 so uh we're going to hope to get up there sometime early eno- 
 last year it was the end of July 
 and it was a little too late for the fish 
 but uh hopefully get up there early enough to get into some of the fish and uh the the good weather and what not
 Uh-huh
 Oh gosh 
 yeah 
 yeah
 That's right
 Sure
 Right
 You bet 
 yeah 
 we'll that you know 
 and there's a lot of places with uh like nature trails things like that where they could learn a lot too
 You know it's like okay this is what uh a pheasant looks like you know 
 and okay now we'll go look for one
 Well yeah 
 that's 
 everybody might learn something that way 
 uh but yeah 
 that's 
 there's an awful lot of things set up you know just anything you want to do 
 like you say it can be uh a water ski trip or fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching you know hunt with a camera type of thing 
 or there's a lot of different opportunities for things like that 
 It's a lot of fun 
 it really is
