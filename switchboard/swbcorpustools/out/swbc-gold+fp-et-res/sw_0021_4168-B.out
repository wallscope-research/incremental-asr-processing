 Uh I like classical music 
 I like rock and roll
 I like country and western 
 Uh I like all kinds 
 I like different things about each one of them
 Oh you don't like country
 the kind of country I like is kind of the older country music not the kind like Kenny Rodgers and stuff like that
 uh that's a little bit to uh 
 it's such 
 they're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing 
 you know what I mean
 Oh like Hank Williams 
 Like the old Hank Williams 
 even Hank Williams Junior is real good stuff 
 The kind that 
 uh this stuff makes you cry it sounds so sad

 you're about like I am then 
 I can't watch M T V anymore 
 I used to love M T V
 And I can barely watch anymore because uh they have this heavy metal stuff on there 
 and you know I can't like that 
 and I liked uh Aerosmith and Led Zepplin you know and uh jeez who else is there Van Halen

 My father likes uh country western music
 He's from uh West Virginia 
 So that's what he grew up listening to
 And he's always liked it 
 and you know he's probably about fifty-three years old now

 so he likes that 
 And my mom always liked that kind of stuff 
 My mom likes like uh Doris Day you know
