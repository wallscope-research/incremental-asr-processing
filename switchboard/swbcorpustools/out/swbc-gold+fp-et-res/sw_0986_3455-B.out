 Oh I heard that was excellent
 Is it
 Uh I wanted to see that 
 I was deciding between that and uh MY GIRL 
 and uh my boyfriend and I went to see MY GIRL
 Oh it was excellent 
 It was a really really good movie 
 I'd recommend it
 Uh I heard the opposite that uh you should take children to see it
 Uh there were quite a few uh kids in there with their parents
 Yeah 
 Uh I don't know though 
 I've heard that and then what you just told me 
 so 
 Right 
 yeah
 It was sad 
 It was really sad
 But uh it kind of shows how his uh best friend this little girl deals with his death and I think maybe how children should deal with death
 Maybe
 But it was really good 
 It was sad very sad
 Yeah
 I heard it was uh sort of like uh not uh too violent 
 but it was kind of like uh gross kind of like uh SILENCE OF THE LAMBS like
 Oh really
 Oh
 Oh yeah
 Uh

 but I 
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 I like to rent movies too

 Uh the last movie I rented was THE HARD WAY with Michael J Fox 
 and uh 
 Yeah
