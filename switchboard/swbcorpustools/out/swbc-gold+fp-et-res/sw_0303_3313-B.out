 Yes
 That's a rather broad topic 
 Yeah
 Uh we live in Plano
 Uh and where you are
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 that is so frightening
 Uh do you have children in school
 Yeah
 Well I have 
 my oldest is his first year in high school 
 so we have all this to look forward to 
 and it is really frightening uh to think that you can't even send them to school in safety 
 certainly you know you can't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas 
 but you know when you can't even send them on their normal activities in safety it's really frightening
 And uh I really you know 
 they're coming down on the principal 
 but I really don't know what they can do 
 it's just in so much of society with the violence 
 and the kids having access to weapons and drugs 
 and I really don't know what can be done
 Well I don't either 
 but apparently they just really are 
 Uh to me in Plano you would think that would be you know about as innocent as you could get for being in a large area 
 But you know my son comes home and tells me that you know he hears kids talk about having guns 
 and uh someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun
 And it just scared me to death 
 and you know they called the police 
 and nothing happened 
 but my goodness you know it could have easily
 Maybe so
 Yeah
 Oh no
 I just can't imagine that
 Right
 Right 
 well I can see you know especially if you heard screams from a house or something not going over there maybe because you know it could be dangerous 
 but certainly I can't understand not calling the police
 I 
 Right 
 Well I think you're right there 
 I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business 
 but I think that's real dangerous 
 and uh I don't know 
 I try to tell my kids just kind of be aware of what's around them you know 
 and if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble just get out of it or call for help whichever
 But uh 
 Yeah
 Well maybe this thing with the child at school maybe that will make people think a bit more and you know take some steps to correct it 
 I don't know 
 it really is frightening
 I uh 
 I don't know 
 I don't know the details 
 This was not a child that was on the team 
 It was someone that uh you know just kind of showed up at the field
 Uh it was a student age person 
 but I'm not even
