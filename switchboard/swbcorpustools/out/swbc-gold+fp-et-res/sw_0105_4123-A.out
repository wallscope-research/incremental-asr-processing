 Jimmy so how do you get most of your news
 Oh wow 
 So when you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when
 Oh okay 
 Well I would probably be a junkie or watch C N N a lot 
 but uh I don't uh subscribe to cable because of the poor service and also uh because 
 well uh I give to the United Way 
 and so I figured that amount of money I just donate to that
 Yeah 
 I take away a uh addiction 
 Oh something
 Well I 
 Oh
 what uh newspapers do you read
 Uh-huh 
 For a while there I uh subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES actually a couple of newspapers because uh you know my fiance 
 well she was unemployed for a while 
 so she you know really needed to look at the help wanted ads
 and so often the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of uh news 
 And I don't know 
 NEW YORK TIMES is okay 
 uh and when you read a lot of this stuff the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so 
 but uh they say it's like the sixth grade reading level

 Uh but I don't know 
 I guess it's still a lot of hype 
 Look at the Smith trial
 that was a joke
 Oh yeah 
 the N P R doing that 
 yeah 
 I know 
 I had uh some visitor 
 and he was just I don't know fixated on that you know just listened to it constantly 
 Uh and I guess that's good when it's live if you'll really want that
 but that's not really providing you news
 it's more like a media event rather than reporting
 Oh really 
 That's kind of boring to me I think
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I guess that's true 
 But one of the ways that I get information is uh every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this thing 
 it's free inside the company 
 it's called INTELLECT 
 and they basically uh type out abstracts which are really literally 
 I've actually read the actual articles 
 they're pretty g-
