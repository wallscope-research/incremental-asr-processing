 Well I keep trying to get away from them 
 I used to use a lot of credit cards 
 I guess for a while I would use you know a variety of the Visa and the MasterCard and the stores 
 but I think I impulse buy too much with them 
 or I buy things you know I see it on sale 
 and I think oh it's on sale I have to get it 
 and I really don't need it 
 or I really haven't budgeted for it 
 so um the last couple of years I really have tried not to use them at all
 What about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 okay
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Huh 
 Uh-huh
 That's true 
 if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket 
 Sometimes you may think well I don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something
 Yeah 
 you think well I don't have it now but payday will come and then I'll have the money
 But that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time 
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Right 
 Besides the fact that how much interest you pay and then this 
 Yeah 
 this thing that you thought you got on sale by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time 
 you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Service charge you mean
 Yearly fee 
 yeah
 Oh you get that stuff in the mail all the time
 What I really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that I do have still that they send you these things that look like checks
 and they say hey you know two thousand dollars you know free to you kind of thing you know 
 all you got to do is go cash those things 
 and you've got a short term loan 
 I hate it 
 I can't believe they have the nerve to do that 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think it's somewhat a uh symptom of me generation 
 and that 
 we think we need all these things 
 and I think my parents always you know did without or saved up to you know buy things 
 and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have you know 
 like when I first got my apartment and I was setting it up I did try to economize some 
 but you know I was just like well I have to have it all furnished and I have to have all of my kitchen setup 
 and you don't you know do without too much 
 and you know that's how I got started kind of with setting up a household all up you know it kind of like in the short amount of time 
 You know you just have to have these things just you know have them at home have to have them at my own place 
 and that's you know a big expenditure to start um buying all these things that you think or have to have 
 and actually they're kind of luxuries 
 or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place you know going in one big swoop save up and then buy it
 But we're not into that 
 We're into like have to have it all now
 Well we're geared to that 
 We're like 
 okay 
 like I want a living room set And instead of sitting back and going okay well it's going to cost maybe a thousand dollars two thousand dollars 
 and I'll save for two years
 people go oh well I'll just go put it on credit and they'll pay it off
 People aren't tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it 
 they just put it on account and then pay off the bill because they want it now 
 It's always have to have it now
 no 
 no 
 but I have had some times when I've had some pretty good balances on there 
 and uh you know I finally you know paid them all off and thought this is you know kind of nonsense 
 So we don't uh have big balances on them at 
 all now you know we 
 I use it occasionally 
 but I pay it right off 
 We're 
 Yeah 
 you learn you know the hard way you hate paying all that interest 
 and I've never been one to itemize on my income tax and never had enough to itemize 
 and so it's just a big chunk of money 
 and you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying so much more for that item because you've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what forty dollars sometimes just to have the card
 That's a lot of money that you went to buy this item
 And then you never feel like you've got anything to put into savings or anything 
 you're always just paying bills you know 
 you don't feel that you have any extra to save 
 And I hate living paycheck to paycheck 
 I like to have a little there you know 
 that I can save 
 so I can feel that you know if something comes up I've got the money to pay for it
