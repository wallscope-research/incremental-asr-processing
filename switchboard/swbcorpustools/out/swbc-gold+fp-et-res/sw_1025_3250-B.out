 Why don't you go ahead and start
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 for a while I haven't gotten any because I just find that I'm not reading what I'm getting because uh I have so much going on in my life 
 that seems to be the last thing I pick up 
 so I found that I was wasting my money As much as I enjoy them uh when I do subscribe 
 I've gotten in the past the PARENTS magazine and uh the HOUSEKEEPING magazine
 uh 
 Yes 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Right 
 well I found that after a couple of years of having a PARENTS magazine it was getting repetitious 
 so I kind of canceled it anyway for that reason 
 Uh the HOUSEKEEPING magazines I do like because like you say they have nice uh recipes in them and ideas but uh lately they've just been piling up on me 
 so I figured it wasn't uh something I needed at this point in time
 I don't know 
 I well 
 my husband would love to have more 
 Now he's the type who will get the uh INC magazine and MONEY magazine and all the financial type magazines
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yes Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well 
 yeah 
 and some of those have had what I consider or what 
 I get the idea that they are maybe the more pricier type magazines as far as women's magazines 
 They seem just to be so chocked full of ads
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yes
 Right 
 Yes
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yes
 I enjoy books a lot more
 that's true
 Well
 now I have certainly stopped subscribing as much as I used to 
 other than my children have gotten 
 You know they get tons of magazines it seems
 they're always getting something in the mail 
 uh so between reading to them and uh reading the newspaper 
 and then I have a book that I'm occasionally reading when I get a chance 
 but I just don't get a chance for those uh newsy magazines the ones that are full of ads 
 unless you just want to skim through while you're 
 I read them when I'm at a doctor's office or you know waiting on something like that
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 That's true 
 that kind of is a good way to do it
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Okay
