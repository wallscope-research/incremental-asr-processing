 Oh really
 Uh 
 That's good
 I never really thought about that 
 but uh a good turn over would be sort of nice 
 Course if you find a place you like and it works out that no one else likes it it would be sort of sad to see it go under
 Are they big into ambiance down there 
 or is it more like 
 uh Texas to me makes 
 it seems like it would be portions would be the big thing
 Yeah 
 right 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Um 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Oh well uh we have a lot of favorites here uh in Northern Virginia 
 and of course we've got D C to call on you know
 and there's all sorts of things down there 
 One thing about D C is that there are a lot of traditional restaurants where you know the guy used to be the cook for the Capitol 
 and so he stays in the same restaurant for twenty years you know
 and he's got a big clientele 
 and um so there are some hang outs where you can go if you want to see people 
 You know it's sort of like Hollywood in a way because there's favorite haunts for Southerners and things like that
 Um we don't hang around with them because usually it's you know ninety dollars a plate or something silly like that
 So uh but uh my wife has a friend that runs one of the restaurants down there 
 and we've been down there and had French cuisine 
 and uh I don't know 
 I don't particularly care for that sort of thing just the type of food just because I do like uh you know getting a meal
 And uh most French food always leaves me hungry for some reason
 I don't know what they say about Chinese 
 I'm always hungry after a French meal uh
 And uh 
 but the atmosphere is just wonderful 
 You do feel like you've gone out you know and done something when you go to a French restaurant or a restaurant downtown 
 Well as out here you might have enjoyed the meal and go away feeling satisfied it's not so much an event you know out in the suburbs when you go to a local restaurant
 And they're starting to get a little bit different um
 they're realizing that more of the people with the money are coming out and living in the suburbs getting away from the city 
 and so there are a couple jazz houses you know that have jazz bands playing while you're eating and stuff like that which is kind of nice because 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 right
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 We have uh two very special places in Northern Virginia that people go to 
 Uh one's called Captain Pell's which is a crab house you know being so close to Maryland
 Maryland is you know a big place for crabs with the bay pretty much taking over most of Maryland
 And um Captain Pell's is a place with the big huge wooden tables inside
 and people just go in there and just pig out and everything 
 And then um the other place is called the Vienna Inn which is uh uh 
 Vienna is a suburb of D C also in Virginia 
 and uh that place is known for the rudest waitresses in the country are at the Vienna Inn
 And uh people go there to be abused 
 you actually go in there to be abused by the waitresses and the bartenders and stuff
 And people come all over the country amazed at um the abuse they were seized
 And then it's on the honor system 
 You pay totally on the honor system
 And so you know you tell them what you've eaten and what you drank or whatever 
 and they figure out the bill for you 
 and you're lucky if you get change 
 Usually they take your change and throw you a couple of mints in your hand and say thanks you know
 Because uh they 
 Yeah 
 carry on with the abuse 
 they say you need mints 
 here guy you don't get any change you know
 Oh wow
