 <> Well I think health care is real important and dental coverage 
 but I guess medical insurance is probably what I consider the second most important
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 I know 
 no matter what you do about that yeah unless you're like a Senior V P or something which I am not 
 Yeah 
 I know 
 It's um 
 I don't know 
 And then when you interview for a job or something sometimes people um expect the benefits to take the place of a certain salary level
 You know say maybe we'll pay you X amount annually 
 but then you know ten percent to fifteen percent more are your benefits 
 and if you're like 
 are you married
 Um like my husband works 
 and I do 
 so I don't take some of 
 I have certain things that I take 
 and he has other things he takes
 So in that kind of situation it's really almost redundant you know
 You know that some of the benefits I would rather have um money 
 Yeah 
 more money actually um Or flex time or something that was a little more personal you know
 you don't use the medical insurance
 You use your company's
 Where does <> he work if you don't mind me 
 Yo- 
 Oh you're kidding 
 What's the name of that company 
 What do they do
 Uh-huh
 Are they a big Company 
 or 
 Uh-huh 
 see that's probably cause Canada has the um government run health care systems social medicine
 And you don't pay them If you live there 
 it's like Europe 
 You don't pay a dime
 You know 
 Sounds wonderful
 <> Yeah 
 if I were him I'd tell him make sure he stays there
 Oh my goodness
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I don't work at T I 
 My husband works at T I 
 but um I work for E D S 
 but it's like um 
 You know they're both 
 basically E D S is a little bit better than T I 
 Um and we take his medical 
 And the medical I think it's terrible you know
 twenty 
 but then they're getting ready to change it again for Aetna
 Um I don't know 
 I just don't think companies um they want you to feel responsible and don't abuse the medical system 
 and you know Um T I just did the thing where with the smoking premiums 
 We don't smoke 
 but do you know about the smoking premiums
 Yeah 
 do you guys smoke 
 Oh yeah
 But then you know like a lady in my office said she said her husband works for T I too 
 And she said what about the people that are walking around 
 and I hope 
 you don't sound like you're in this category but for extremely obese people or something*[[needs slash unit note punctuation]] The kind of people that can't sit in the airplane chair you know 
 You know who's going to croak first The people that smoke or you know
 Seems like an unnecessary penalty 
 yeah
 I'm not all for smoking at all 
 but you know I don't how they can do it
 Carte blanket 
 *[[listen: probably closer to "carte blanche"]] Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Or something 
 Yeah 
 it's like stupid 
 but That's why I'm not a boss I guess 
 I don't know um 
 what other type of benefits do they have that Canadian based companies 
 They have to be a little bit different than the American um
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 T I is at least <> five years 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 Oh my goodness
 Uh-huh
 That's kind of nice 
 Yeah 
 T I has that 
 but that's a pretty standard thing anymore
 You know um um husband's company probably matches more than T I though
 Oh they do 
 Yeah 
 it is 
 That's still pretty good though the fact that your vested that quickly in the pension 
 Yeah 
 I know um 
 E D S has eight years 
 I think E D S has seven to eight years
 So it's like T I in that respect you know
 and I'm working for a company that's making money 
 You know E D S has a cash flow problem as they say but um not E D S T I um 
 but I don't know 
 I think everywhere they just need to sit down and hire some people the grunts as I call them like myself to tell them 
 yeah 
 I don't know 
 but if I were to rank them I guess I would say next to income it's really just health benefits 
 And then um for most people I know it would be day care 
 like T I has no day care
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh I don't 
 I would think so 
 yeah 
 because 
 Yeah 
 they really should because they're big enough um 
 and the other thing I think is really good is that E D S is much better than T I at I think right now than that we have day care um uh the health program like T I has Texans
 But [ I don't think that it's developed as much as it could be for the size company as T I
 if you ever walked into E D Ss health corner court health clubs on site and you walk into Spring Creek well Spring Creek's better than the one on Dallas Parkway 
 but I mean yeah 
 Ye- 
 Oh it's really nice 
 yeah
 You know instead of like six um treadmills you've got like twenty
 And E D S can't even compare in size In terms of the number of employees
 So I don't know 
 I guess it's just where um like E D S reimburses you for adoption
 And T I doesn't have anything like that
 You know so I guess I wish the companies like T I and a lot of others were more progressive in that respect 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and they have some strange things 
 they have very strange like dress codes 
 and you know 
 Um you can't wear slacks at the corporate site and that kind of thing unless you're in a y- you know 
 but there aren't manufacturing environments because of the type of company it is
 Um I don't know 
 I guess I also wish that uh companies would look more at cost of living increases instead of just merit reviews
 Oh Yeah 
 exactly
 I know 
 I know
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 and I don't know how you and your husband are too 
 but we have friends that laugh at us 
 and we I clip coupons 
 And I said hey I'll probably do this even if I'm a millionaire which I won't ever be 
 But it's like 
 because you just can't 
 it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something well the car insurance is due 
 
 yeah
 I know 
 I don't know what we're going to do about 
 Yeah 
 you want to rob a bank 
 No 
 I didn't say that
 I didn't say that on this line
 I don't know 
 What else about corporate benefits 
 I can't think 
 It's probably been too hot today for either of us to 
 Um kind of nice to talk to somebody in Dallas 
 Usually people are all over the country
 This is true
 Uh-huh 
 and that doesn't definitely make it any better 
 It's just something you have to keep telling yourself you know that um that's what I want that uh you know 
 people are lucky to have jobs 
 and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits
 When you see people that don't have um anything but H M Os or you know really can't even afford to get in a job that costs 
 like we had a guy fixing our air conditioner 
 And he said he didn't even make ten dollars an hour 
 and he has three kids 
 And I went oh you know that has to be rough
 Um but benefits 
 I don't know 
 I guess one thing I'd like to see too and I don't know how T I is about this but I'd like to see um employees rank and file be able to contribute more um the execution of their job
 You know
 Right yeah
 that's a good word for it um
 How is T I in that mode
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 All part of a good old boy network 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh
 E D S oh they're better 
 but they're a little bit too um stiff collared in terms of you know what you want to do 
 They're pretty much if that's where the widget goes stick it in the hole you know
 They're kind of formula oriented
 Yeah 
 and you can't really argue with them because they've always been successful 
 so You know what can you tell them 
 Really
 Well I guess that's what I know about benefits
 Okay 
 Good talking to you 
 and keep cool
 Okay 
 Bye-Bye
