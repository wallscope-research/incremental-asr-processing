 Okay 
 do you want to go first
 Fitness and exercise
 Okay 
 um I like to do uh weight training and cycling And just walking uh swimming 
 I used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall 
 And the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore 
 so I had to kind of change my life-style a little bit 
 Thirty-eight
 Well the rest of me is in pretty good shape 
 it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to
 Really
 Oh
 Oh I bet that helps
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's right
 That's right
 That's right
 Well if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself 
 and you probably do
 This is true
 Well that 
 I can believe that 
 Have you tried uh the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center
 Yes
 It is 
 They keep it at eighty-one degrees year-round
 Um a fairly good amount uh more on the weekends 
 uh I try to beat the traffic in the mornings when I workout in the mornings I try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center
 Um have you done your attitude survey for this year yet
 You need to put that on there seriously
 Oh you don't
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 This is true
 Yeah
 Well it's not 
 Now what year are we talking about
 Okay 
 uh things have become much more enlightened since then
 Yeah 
 you know we still don't have a day care facility 
 but people are more sympathetic to it
 Yes 
 Yes
 Oh
 My gosh
 Could you hold the phone for one second
 Thanks 
 <> Okay 
 I'm back
 Wow
 Of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back
 Really
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 really
 Yeah
 There you go
 I can believe that
 Oh yeah 
 flex time is great
 I can understand 
 I can understand 
 Well it's been good talking with you
 Oh shoot it's only about ten bucks a month
 Yeah 
 uh to add dependents is you know maybe another dollar or something 
 it's no big deal
 Yeah
 Uh you do for classes 
 but to use any of the facilities is no extra charge
 Yeah 
 it is
 or a depe- 
 or a dependent of one
 Really
 Wonderful
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 it's great
 Uh well it would depend on when you go 
 it's not excessively crowded on the weekends
 Oh I don't think that would be bad at all 
 If you're in Richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the Dallas site
 Oh well then you could go either one
 the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern has a lot more niceties amenities 
 and you'd probably like the pool there
 Well good 
 I'm glad
 Well thank you
 You have a good day
 Bye-bye
