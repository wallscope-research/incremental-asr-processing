 Well I guess I would first identify myself as middle aged 
 and therefore having seen the last generation I guess it you know gives me a perspective on that
 Uh I am quite positive on the things that I have seen happen recently relative to women both in society and in the work place 
 uh there's no doubt about the fact that when I was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily 
 Uh now I think the change that I've seen as much as anything is one where couples uh are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place
 And I guess that's a significant change that I've both participated in and noticed
 Uh-huh
 Wonder about them in what way
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I have not to be honest had much experience with children in that situation 
 I guess one knows one's own storly 
 and I know uh in my children's case it was one where uh pretty much up until the older of two was uh let's see I guess basically starting junior high 
 and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force
 Uh 
 so I guess my experience is just with what we did 
 and so they didn't really go through the child care route
 They were able to be home together 
 Uh and we never actually experienced that 
 in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the next generation or so I guess I anticipate uh an increasing equality uh greater presence of women in management roles
 uh I don't know whether there will be an increased amount of surrogacy that we see 
 I just don't know
 Uh deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother
 Sort of rent-a-mom 
 you know not to be crass about it but uh uh whether one might conceive no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of uh uh a professional mother person For instance that 
 and you know I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting uh uh story or whatever
 I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that 
 In fact I think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession
 Uh I don't have other than a reading and male perspective on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not 
 Uh my sense is that I have very much an interest and had one in being a parent 
 I don't know that I uh felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs
 Uh I don't have boys 
 that didn't bother me 
 never has 
 Vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or as a professional nanny as you put it uh
 Maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of say taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care
 It would be a sort of day care 
 but it would be more of a family setting
 Uh I know that there are young people characterized I guess as being half my age so by definition that means they're young Uh in my work place who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman uh eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child
 I could easily envision that 
 Pardon
 Or to put their child into a home setting where you know like they would leave at eight in the morning and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids 
 and you were paying for really high quality care
 Uh I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures on the order of what I quoted to someone because that's the experience they want 
 and I would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 I haven't ever really looked at them 
 Are you aware at all of what they cost 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in American society
 That's okay too
 Uh-huh
 I'm noticing that too 
 and I notice a terming emerging called solo parents that I'm very aware of the number of solo mothers that I encounter in the work place
 and that is a little troublesome Uh because the pressures on them are rather formidable
 Uh and maybe that's a change we'll see 
 Maybe uh the possibility of women uh who deliberately say no 
 we'll let the man take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever
 So 
 Well I think we're about done 
 Okay
 Uh good-bye
 You take care
 Bye
