 I'll let you go first
 Yeah 
 it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty
 Yeah 
 I know what you mean 
 Um I 
 in Maryland they do have capital punishment
 and uh I've seen uh a lot of people get sentenced 
 and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals
 Yeah 
 what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years
 And uh here in Maryland I know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons uh 
 just 
 Yeah 
 but in 
 here it's uh to the point where they were letting prisoners go Uh commuting the sentences of those that were in jail for lesser crimes in order to put more people into the jails
 And it was just uh amazing to me 
 and of course they made a big deal out of the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out and being rearrested an 
 Uh I can't remember 
 Refresh my memory
 Um I don't remember myself
 Um if they started executing them on a regular basis uh I think it might make a difference 
 Right now I don't see it making a difference 
 I don't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death 
 most people out there committing murders don't care 
 They just don't care
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and uh there's a lot of people here in Baltimore that uh have 
 and we just had uh a real big cocaine bust 
 and of course you know they're playing it up real big that it looked like it was a very very small ring 
 and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy
 But uh Baltimore has uh an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year 
 I think they've got over a hundred dead already this year
 Well it's kind of moved up 
 and you have to remember that uh there's I think X number of people out there that are going to commit murders
 and uh once you kill off a few of them 
 if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that pretty soon you run out of people to murder
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you know it makes sense um you know 
 you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but uh so few and far between uh you know 
 makes good T V movies 
 and that's about it
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I had 
 uh my father-in-law participated in uh a jury trial 
 he was actually on the jury
 and uh this man was accused of killing uh I think it was two people uh and shooting a uh policeman um point blank in the face 
 Of course he didn't die
 And uh this was during a holdup of uh uh a restaurant 
 and it came out during the trial that um they had tried to rob another place 
 and uh when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple uh you know jumbo cookies 
 and so they were so upset from robbing this guy you know trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started you know shooting people
 You know it's 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 and get even with who 
 
 you know stupid guys 
 And uh it turned out that the you know policeman survived to the point that he was able to you know identify the guy
 And of course you know they tried to make the cop look like he was uh a uh no good rotten drunk
 it was amazing
 Oh he was found guilty 
 yeah
 He uh um 
 last I heard uh he beat a push for the death penalty 
 Now whether they finally got it or not I don't know
 I kind of uh stopped listening after a while
 Um you know he would come home 
 and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on 
 and of course then they had to go back to dec- you know 
 after he had to go 
 Right 
 And uh yeah everybody was pretty much you know let's burn him
 And you know that's the way they wanted to do it 
 And he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he uh 
 you know some people on the case were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges 
 but when it all came down they just within an hour decided the man's fate
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well it went pretty quick from what he said
 But there's a lot of other crimes out there besides murder 
 I think uh now if you're dealing drugs now caught more than twice or something uh there's uh a death penalty associated with it
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I agree
 Yeah 
 I agree 
 I have uh a low tolerance for uh that kind of person 
 And uh as far as uh you know 
 there are some other crimes that I think uh you know uh 
 kidnapping um you know when they 
 kidnapping per se has a certain uh uh fine and penalty associated with it
 but um some of these people are just out and out brutal 
 I 
 some of the cases I've heard about over the years
