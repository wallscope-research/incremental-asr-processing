 Um personally I don't have a problem with it uh 
 I think uh as far as uh protecting fellow employees protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do um it's justified 
 On the other hand um I do agree that it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work
 Um I would never have a problem with anyone testing me 
 but I can understand why people would object 
 So uh I guess uh I'm kind of mixed on it still at this point
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 That's absolutely right 
 uh I guess it all comes down to uh you know a definition of uh how much outside activities affect your work 
 and uh uh granted you know that 
 any kind of drug use on company property and whatnot is definitely not acceptable 
 Uh uh I don't think anybody would ever argue that Or uh any after affects carrying over into the workday 
 but um you know I'm not particularly concerned with what people do um after they leave for the day especially if I don't uh see any results of it the next day 
 Well it you know 
 on the other hand uh you've got uh the possibility of people oh 
 you've got some people could be arrested for uh drug use drug dealings and things like that 
 and uh if their employers name hits the papers and that it's a mark against them 
 the company and uh you know what kind of people work there what uh 
 That's right 
 That's right
 Right 
 even if it is you know a company policy of uh immediate termination or whatever they still have to replace them
 And uh there's a lot involved there
 I think the regular schedule stuff um that when you say everybody get out of it that's a good point 
 I never really thought of it that way
 Yeah 
 if they really can 
 um I think the biggest problem I've got is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment
 Um as far as the new hires I hired on just early enough that I missed it Um where the new hires were concerned 
 but uh no 
 I don't think anybody questions that um testing someone as a precondition to being hired 
 but um for the conditions that for our employment to change while you're on the job that's where I think that most people get upset 
 it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically 
 and uh it's a really tough question 
 and you know it 
 people have really quieted down after everything started 
 but I still think there's a lot of resentment
 Uh-huh
 You bet
 No 
 that's right 
 Yeah 
 I know of some people who did uh 
 it was indirectly related {D you know 
 } they could always come up with other reasons 
 but it had a lot to do with it Just the whole attitude 
 because uh it's just really 
 it seems so un- 
 T I you know with the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have um to all of a sudden uh search for attitudes and whatnot 
 You know there's not a lot of pressure to vote the right way or anything else around T I 
 like there is in some companies or at least you know 
 from what I've heard 
 but uh 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 No 
 I 
 Absolutely not you know 
 it's you know 
 if you hired me I'll be you know 
 supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with 
 so uh you know let's stick with that original trust I guess
 But uh it still remains a tough question 
 and there's a lot of you know the whole department of defense uh reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot 
 There's a lot of different things that uh come into play 
 but that was 
 I think everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company
 Uh-huh
 I really don't think so
 Yeah 
 I really don't because some people are going to risk it um 
 it may prevent e- 
 I guess what I'm trying to get at is if it does help a few individuals maybe it's worth it
 Um you know it may prevent somebody who was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot 
 but uh I don't know if you know the 
 it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation 
 I don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much 
 there's still a big question in my mind 
 the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of mistakes on the testing is something that still bothers me 
 it's 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Absolutely 
 And that 
 uh I don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too even you know if you take uh a drug that was prescribed for you 
 but the the prescription has run out you still had some left 
 and you happen to take an extra penicillin 
 well penicillin's not on the list 
 but you know 
 yeah 
 I think you understand what I'm getting at
 it can still show up 
 and it can still flag as a positive 
 and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent
 and uh those are the kinds of things that still can show up
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 That's right 
 I even had friends when I was going to college who were in uh pharmacy school 
 and they could legally um provide medicine to their family members and friends 
 certain medicines were legal now 
 I believe you know any of the ones we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists
 but uh um there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications 
 and that can happen 
 But uh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I think so 
 You too
 Good-bye
