 in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I know and lawyers and whatnot I think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem
 Why 
 Well if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students so they could become doctors the problem would go away
 I think the problem is that the doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor you are going to pay high premiums uh on your liability
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 And you think there are plenty of doctors
 Uh-huh
 It's astronomical
 No 
 people don't sue
 lawyers sue 
 If you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor they wouldn't sue a one of them You know
 Well sure
 But you know when you think about reasonableness now I believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory 
 You know what tort theory is
 Well a tort is when you do something wrong
 Well it uh 
 an O B G Y N doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent
 If the baby is born dead well that happens
 if they have complications and 
 Well I know there are guys that are real slobs 
 but you know there are also people out there that are really doing their job 
 And the people that are really doing their job are paying for everybody else You know
 Just to prevent a a law suit
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 See I believe that there is a system already in place for health care
 You know they have indigent health care 
 You show up at Parkland bleeding
 and they'll fix you You know
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 <> Yeah 
 I think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation the problem would pretty much evaporate
 Yeah
 Well I happen to know a few 
 and I even claim one as a friend
 He's a divorce attorney
 But 
 I think he'll go nameless for the purposes of this conversation 
 But I also know an uh O B G Y N who has stopped practicing
 Uh he just said 
 Yeah 
 he's not going to deliver any more babies ever
 His malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year
 And you know he said he had to gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice
 Yeah 
 <> This guy is Catholic Yeah 
 you know Yeah 
 I know you can be human and Catholic
 but you're not likely to find somebody who is going to you know have a less conscientious effort
 
 Well you know who is getting rich 
 Insurance companies
 You know if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance 
 say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed 
 or
