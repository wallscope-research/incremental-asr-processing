 Okay
 Well I like dining out 
 Of course it means that I don't have to cook
 But um I'm a divorced woman 
 I have one child
 and you know when we dine out we go to like medium priced restaurants
 I don't particularly 
 I think it's sort of a waste of money to go to a real high priced restaurant
 Um Not really 
 We go more for the uh Chinese and Italian and stuff like that Mexican stuff that I can't cook 
 Yeah
 Um well I like Chinese food
 Um there's a little place down on what is that Coit Road um Chinese Pavilion or something That is really good 
 and I like it 
 And um I do like Chinese buffets
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Ha- 
 yeah 
 have you ever um tried Pappasito's
 Oh it is delicious
 Uh-huh
 It's 
 you always stand in line when you go
 but it's worth the wait
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 And have you ever tried um the Macaroni Grill up on 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 they're the Spaghetti Warehouse type
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 but my little girl likes uh Spaghetti Warehouse real well 
 It's real entertaining for her
 Um not really 
 a steak is something that I cook at home You know that you grill out
 and I really don't particularly um 
 Huh
 Steak 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Yes
 Right 
 I think that's what you know really goes right now in the Dallas area
 Of course you know down next to downtown up around McKinney and everything you know there's a different class of restaurants up there that I can't even touch
 You know it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and have one meal up there 
 but um 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 when I go out it's normally to get um some specialty type of food
 besides you know chicken and steaks and everything I grill at home
 and really they're a lot better than what I get in the restaurant 
 That's right
 Saves you a little bit money
 Um favorite place 
 uh she has a lot 
 Taco Bell 
 Yeah 
 that's right
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 uh-huh
 No 
 not that I know of
 Uh-huh 
 thank you
 Bye-bye
