 See when you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times uh you know the benefits are good 
 and you know the pay is regular 
 but uh you know sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on 
 And I think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages uh that anybody could get in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you get to know what's going on 
 And maybe that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to do
 what's your feeling about benefits 
 What sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well th- 
 well I work for the government 
 and uh actually I work for the F B I
 uh and so you know there's lots of things that we don't get told For good reason 
 uh but basically uh there's lots of things that we should know about projects 
 I'm an engineer You know 
 I'm a COTR 
 And sometim- 
 and I worked in the same lab with a guy 
 and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years 
 And we should have 
 you know we're now collaborating
 And 
 for two years we didn't which was kind of stupid 
 uh but our organization is doing something else on Monday 
 Uh for all unclassified programs we're having little tables put up in front of lab in the hallways 
 and all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do Which I thought was kind of interesting uh but that sort of thing 
 But I think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on
 but of course most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know 
 And you know if you don't really count If you're not part of the program you might not get told for months 
 Or you might you know if it doesn't impact you directly Or if your management doesn't think that 
 but regard to benefits You know most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing 
 In the private sector I would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the mid-fifties is keeping a job until you retire
 And engineers uh are baggage uh uh as they get older to most companies 
 And uh it's very much like the military 
 it windows out 
 You know you think well boy I'm getting more money 
 and I'm getting more responsibility 
 I'm doing this 
 But as you climb up that tree pretty soon the branches get smaller on the top of the tree
 and pretty soon somebody falls off 
 I've fallen off twice in the private sector
 uh and you know I can get up 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 he may be retired
