 Wonderful touch tone telephone there
 Uh I have a wide variety of hobbies 
 therefore my reading pleasures are quite wide 
 Um I get a charge out of uh TEXAS HIGHWAY which is uh very colorful and uh not being a native of Texas but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out uh about the different areas of the state by reading it
 Oh yeah 
 uh absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things 
 It's pretty neat <> 
 Um oh I like photography um magazines 
 I don't take a subscription or anything like that 
 Um things oh 
 being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of uh building magazines and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines 
 and uh kind of strange because it's not unusual to uh see uh an engineering manual or something laying around the house 
 and then I'll sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it 
 but uh 
 How about yourself
 Oh that's great
 Uh-huh
 I bet that would be rather interesting 
 Uh that's uh self improvement 
 well that's kind of a hobby 
 but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing uh
 Um well I hate to 
 yes 
 I do 
 uh we have these classes we attend uh management classes 
 and they give you books 
 and the last book uh matter of fact I read was AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht 
 It talks about uh who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments
 Uh one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is
 Uh so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is 
 and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer 
 Your my customer I'm your customer sort of thing
 Um every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick uh in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh better outlooks on things and the philosophy of Pat Hagerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type Which all you know betters yourself
 Uh-huh
 Like what for example
 Sure
 Sure 
 How about items like um THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER which used to be a big 
 okay
 So those are self improvements
 Um our supervisor uh subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW By a man named Doctor Bittel B I T T E L <> 
 and it's a very layman's uh uh approach towards managing different types of people 
 And the very last chapter {A and I haven't figured out why that one was last } is how to manage engineers 
 So it's interesting 
 here again it's casual reading 
 and it's not eaten up with a lot of uh mechanical stuff 
 and it's really excellent fast reading 
 uh but as you say sometimes it's difficult to know if it's you know 
 I think if somebody would say hey read these ten books because these are self-improvements I would probably be turned off to them
 If he casually just walked into it and uh put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested
 Yeah 
 uh they're hard to set down because it's so interesting 
 and of course they're all just a little spookier than the movies 
 but uh they're always challenging to get through one of them 
 I have a hard time finishing books
 Uh-huh 
 In quality especially now days uh that's almost everything that comes across the airways 
 exactly right
 Yeah I think we name drop it a little too much and don't fully understand what it is we're saying 
 I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk 
 and all that kind of rolls in together there
 but uh that's just kind of part of it
 Uh not that I can think of 
 Um I think I'm under my quota a little bit 
 I need to probably make a phone call or two 
 Uh this is true 
 I've enjoyed it
 Have a good day
 Bye-bye
