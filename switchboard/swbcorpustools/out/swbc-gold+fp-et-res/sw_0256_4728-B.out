 I don't know what you drive now 
 what do you drive now
 Oh okay
 Throw them in the back
 Cab 
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 There you go
 Yeah 
 yo- 
 Right 
 yeah 
 I know
 Yeah 
 you're looking at 
 I got a Toyota Four Runner 
 I wanted a truck that I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too 
 so I got a Four Runner
 You're just like me 
 I've never bought a new vehicle in my life
 No
 Let somebody else break it in 
 right 
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 my 
 pretty much the same 
 like say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners
 and uh it pretty much does everything I need it to 
 it'll tow three thousand pounds 
 so I can tow everything 
 and it 
 I can throw 
 I've had eleven people in it before Believe it or not 
 And uh it's real reliable 
 belie- 
 I've had it for almost four years now 
 and up until oh say two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it
 And then of course two weeks ago it decided 
 I don't know 
 it's the strangest weirdest thing in the world 
 but it blew a head gasket
 Didn't do any damage to it 
 Uh I caught it real early
 Uh oh ninety-seven thousand 
 So it's not real early 
 No 
 Never overheated it 
 uh I smelled the coolant 
 Went out and looked 
 saw where it was coming from 
 Drove it right to the shop and left it off
 And that was it 
 because I have that 
 and then I have a Kawasaki motorcycle Which is actually usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining
 that's sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle 
 it's a 
 I don't know 
 people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves 
 I know 
 but I bet you he really enjoys riding it
 Yeah 
 So you know yo- 
 h- 
 when was the last time you took your truck out just to go driving
 Yeah
 And I go out twice a week on the bike so At least Just for the enjoyment
 But yeah 
 the only thing I think I might get not necessarily a new car but another car 
 uh I would consider going to a normal pickup rather than a covered pickup like the one I've got Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had just an open bed to throw stuff in
 I'm sure that that's very 
 you got one 
 that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back 
 and 
 Right
 To have it out of the way 
 Right 
 I think they last a lot longer than anything else 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 the trucks do 
 Uh even though you know the little Jap trucks are good there too 
 But so are the 
 though I think the Chevies 
 I don't think the Che- 
 I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords
 I think the Fords tend to last a little longer At least until recently 
 A friend of mine just bought like a year ago it's a really nice truck 
 I don't like Dodges at all 
 but one of the Dodges they have out now has uh the Cummins turbo diesel on it
 Oh it's beautiful
 that thing will last forever 
 Oh yeah 
 that thing's uh 
 it's got a boat engine in it 
 Uh-huh
