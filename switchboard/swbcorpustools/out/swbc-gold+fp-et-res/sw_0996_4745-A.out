 Uh I don't know about you 
 but uh I work outside the home 
 and uh in fact uh I'll be leaving very shortly to go to work 
 and I work different shifts so are pretty much a later shift to where I don't have the family time 
 Uh when my husband gets home he's home with my daughter alone 
 and then a couple of hours later I'm home 
 Uh I don't know 
 I'm finding that more and more people that I talk to there's less and less family time available to them 
 And uh it seems that your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family 
 So you know if you do have any time it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done uh just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home plus try to have that relationship with your children 
 and it's a very hard juggling act
 And you know I look at my daughter 
 and she's now uh going to be four 
 and I keep saying oh jeez I don't have that much time with her 
 And she's growing fast 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 Yeah <>
 Sure 
 Exactly 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh 
 Exactly 
 Uh-huh
 Sure 
 sure
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Sure
 Sure 
 Sure 
 Yeah 
 I 
 I think so too 
 In fact uh I spent the first three years at home with my daughter 
 so I guess I felt fairly fortunate that I was able to do that 
 And I did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in daycare 
 and I thought to myself how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks 
 whatever the employer says you have to be back at work is basically when you have to be back at work whether it be six weeks or three or four 
 But how these women must feel to place their children into care 
 and you know it's our society saying yes 
 you need this job 
 It's a little bit financial type thing 
 because uh if you look all over in the other countries like Europe and that uh their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are 
 and that's part of it too 
 But uh like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties uh were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision well jeez you know I'll go out and get a part-time job 
 Got a part-time job 
 and then financially they got themselves into well I'll have the boat 
 I'll have the car 
 and it's nice 
 and really past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too uh 
 because our financial situations are as it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now 
 and 
 Uh-huh 
 Sure 
 I did it for three years 
 and uh it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it 
 and pretty soon you know you're at the limit where you've got to say okay you've sacrificed for you know so many years at home 
 and you're not getting any further you know along
 and you have to make that decision to go back to work part-time or go back to work full-time 
 and you have to make that decision 
 and it's a tough one
 And I 
 Uh-huh
 Sure
