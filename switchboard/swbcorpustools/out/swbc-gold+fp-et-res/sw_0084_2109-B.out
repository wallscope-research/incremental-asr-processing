 Okay Mary
 Um uh the latest one I've seen uh had to do with uh basically a manhunt um 
 and uh it was called MANHUNTER actually 
 Uh uh the guy uh apparently had a mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people Uh just uh kill them with as much blood and guts as possible
 it was truly awful 
 It was not one that I picked 
 but uh uh it did show uh some interesting things about the F B I 
 because uh the characters trying to get him were F B I people 
 and uh uh of the few good things that were in it it did show uh a lot about the F B I About the training and how they go through training and how they try to develop uh uh a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that 
 And uh uh it was pretty telling about the F B I and their procedures
 Yeah 
 I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I uh going I guess
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Oh that was great one
 Oh I loved it
 You know I haven't seen that one yet 
 and I need to go see it
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh my 
 You bet especially in the South
 Well as I recall it got some Academy Awards didn't it
 Oh yeah 
 that's right 
 it might have one best picture too
 Yeah
 That was 
 yeah 
 I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms uh of how to act from Dustin Hoffman 
 but uh 
 Yeah 
 it must have been great just being with him on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his lines and all that stuff
 Oh 
 is the Kmart there 
 that was so funny 
 he had to 
 was it Kmart
 He had to buy his underwear at Kmart
 That was hilarious 
 the first uh scene in that movie that really got my attention uh concerning the disease and all that was when he uh dropped the uh the toothpicks
 and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image
 Unbelievable
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 wel- because that's the way they might seem outwardly
 but boy there's a lots going on in there 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and I think the best thing about RAINMAN was uh the way that they put together the real awfulness of the disease only 
 and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it you know 
 and you need to work with it uh you know certainly on a daily basis but then again work with it toward a good end not toward winning in Las Vegas for example
 Yeah
 Right 
 right 
 uh I was so impressed with that movie 
 I saw it three times
 I can tell you oh so much about that movie just because it really uh rang a lot of uh my personal background 
 I have a brother myself that's older 
 and uh he's not you know 
 nothing of course serious is wrong with him 
 uh but we have gone through these lapses of a relationship sometimes 
 and then you know uh for no real you know direct reason I guess uh we get into uh uh a really good relationship for a while and then you know back and forth 
 so I was really able to relate to the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers 
 That was neat
 Yeah 
 a lot
 Uh-huh 
 No question 
 he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that 
 He likes the bang them up and shoot them up things
 and uh it was like pulling teeth to go get him to see it 
 but uh oh boy he gave the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN 
 he certainly didn't 
 he only saw it one time 
 and he didn't go back for more 
 but uh he said he enjoyed it 
 and 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and he really 
 I don't know 
 he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway 
 but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this 
 I'm like oh come on
 Yeah
 And to make it believable
 I was believing it 
 I don't know about any body else 
 but it was great
 He did great
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 you take care up there 
 and uh let's hear it for the summertime
 No 
 oh no 
 Oh well take care
 Bye bye
