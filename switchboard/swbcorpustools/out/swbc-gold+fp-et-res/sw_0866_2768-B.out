 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I agree with you 
 I um 
 a group that I'm a part of goes once a month to um they call it the Heritage House
 it's a nursing home for elderly people
 And this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape
 A lot of them have had um limbs amputated or um have serious illnesses You know that kind of thing 
 And um I watched 
 the interesting thing was I watched this particular one change hands 
 It started out just being a terrible place for the people
 and then a new company bought it and came in and remodeled the whole place
 Hired new nurses and uh just redid it you know
 Well to me it was dirty for one thing
 Uh when you would walk in the smell was just awful 
 you know the floors if you're walking on them feel how filthy they were
 Um there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and you know crying
 Of course I don't know how many of them were you know not in their right mind or how many were 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I just really don't know 
 but I feel like they were neglected
 And um yeah 
 that was what I was going to say 
 It sounds like just neglect all over
 You know neglect to cleanup
 I don't really think anyone was being you know cruel or trying to mistreat them or anything 
 I just think they were not doing anymore you know than they had to do 
 And um just kind of letting everybody live in a not very good environment 
 But this new company came in 
 and like I said they remodeled the place
 And it smells nice when you walk in 
 And it looks nice 
 And they got like several new color T V's for the people And redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more place for them to be
 They made a little patio area where they can go outside
 Yeah 
 Just you know small things that make it seem a lot more homey
 Yeah 
 And it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just uh 
 Right
 Right 
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Exactly 
 Yeah
 Right 
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well they uh 
 this place that we visit it's really neat 
 everyday they have schedules of groups that come in
 And they will do bingo 
 Our group does a church service once a month
 And then other groups come in and do the services you know other Sundays
 So that they have at least one service every Sunday
 So there are a lot of things 
 There are places that have a lot of things for them to do 
 But you really do have to kind of seek it out you know and make sure that it's not a place like this one was 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 it is 
 It's real nice 
 And um I know our church does it 
 and there are a lot of other churches 
 and they are just like civic organizations that do 
 And uh I have other friends 
 It's kinds of neat they take animals over and let the people pet them
 Like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home 
 and they will wash it all up and make sure it's a friendly animal you know And take it in and just let the old elderly people pet the dogs
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 I thought that was a real unusual thing for someone to do 
 So yeah 
 there's a lot that can be done
 It's just a matter of people not being lazy
 And you know doing the best they can 
 Again I don't know what I'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother you know
 Right
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I would too
 Yeah 
 right
 Yeah 
 I know 
 I know what you mean
 Yeah 
 Well I have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because um many of them of course their minds are not good
 And so a lot them have told me exactly the same story you know
 every time I visit them They'll reminisce about childhood and tell me something that they did 
 and then the next time I go it's the same thing you know just somebody to listen to them
 Uh just seems to make them really feel good
 Right 
 I'll tell you the people I feel the sorriest for 
 there's a guy at this particular one I go to that I think that he's really an intelligent person
 but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate
 And um he's blind 
 and he has seizures you know
 he's just like in a world of his own 
 and yet he wants so much to be around people 
 And if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he'll grab it and kiss it
 Oh and he's always got a smile 
 he really tries to brighten up your life 
 Oh it's just amazing
 But he can't say anything 
 He can just kind of make noises
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Me too
 Yeah 
 I know
 I know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Oh it does
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it is 
 it's really hard 
 But one of the neatest things I think though is we always take our kids 
 I have a three year old and a six year old
 and they um have gotten comfortable being around these people because they've always gone with us
 and the people love them
 And they want the children you know to hug them or hold their hand 
 and so far my kids will do it Just real easily
 and I think it's because they've gone since they were real little
 and they've never been afraid 
 But that's something 
 to me children you know need to 
 people need to take groups of children Because the kids just brighten up their lives
 As we walk through the lobby they'll all say bring her here 
 I want to see her 
 I would love to hold her
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 That's true
 Yeah
 Well me too
 Yeah 
 It's quite an experience
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 there are 
 and uh it really helps those people I think
 But like you said I'd really have a lot of second thoughts before I put any of my own family members there
 It would be a last resort
 Oh I know 
 I'm always afraid like oh 
 no 
 what if I lose my mind
 Am I going to end up in a place like that 
 Yeah 
 that's right
 Well 
 Yeah 
 You too Tonya 
 Thanks for calling
 Bye
