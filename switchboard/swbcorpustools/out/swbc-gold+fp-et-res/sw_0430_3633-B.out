 Well really the only things that I have returned have not been faulty 
 it's been because of the size or some problem like that 
 I really haven't had to return things because they didn't perform the way they were supposed to
 Uh-huh 
 What age are your children
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Well my daughter is twenty-one now 
 so it's been a while since we've had Barbie things 
 But we did have Barbies and things 
 and there 
 seems to me that became a craze when she was already oh like you know third fourth fifth grade
 So she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it 
 but uh I don't remember her breaking a lot of stuff 
 No 
 I don't 
 But I also don't remember lots of little pieces 
 They've got so many different things with it now 
 Goodness 
 Oh dear
 Well uh I guess if they'll replace them then they assume they shouldn't have broken
 Any direction 
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Yeah 
 The main thing that they had when my daughter was playing with Barbies was just clothes
 You know that was about it
 Uh-huh
 And the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics 
 my children are twenty-one and twenty-five and twenty-eight
 Uh-huh 
 and 
 No 
 not really 
 We uh haven't had that much you know problem with things that we have bought 
 They seem to last 
 In fact when they offer us extended warranties we don't buy them because we find we don't need them
 And uh it seems like it's just an added tack on 
 Plus a lot of the credit cards now you know will guarantee 
 if you purchase on your credit card you know then they put an extended warranty on it if it doesn't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time 
 so it seems like it's a waste of money
 Uh-huh 
 And like on a recliner once I bought you know an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that 
 and I never used it
 And so it seems ridiculous 
 And like washers and dryers and things like that I've never had one go out 
 In fact they usually 
 when they do go out it's either something my husband can buy the part and fix 
 and we don't even have a repairman come 
 or it means it's old enough that it's time to replace the whole thing 
 Uh-huh
 So 
 I do too
 Uh-huh 
 And they charge you a pretty good price for them too 
 Uh-huh
 Well my husband finally just put his foot down 
 and he said we're not going to buy any of these anymore 
 and if it goes out well you know 
 Uh-huh 
 uh so we really have been fairly happy with things 
 but now we take good care of things 
 and we don't uh run out and buy a lot of things either 
 And since our kids aren't little anymore I'm not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken 
 Well you look at the consumer guide
 And uh you go around 
 and you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the
