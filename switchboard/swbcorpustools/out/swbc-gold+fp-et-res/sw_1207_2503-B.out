 I'm doing fine 
 Where you from
 Okay 
 I'm from Berkeley California
 Yeah 
 it certainly is
 No 
 Use too 
 Use to 
 but none right now
 Well I live in an apartment building 
 and it's just not feasible you know 
 I'd love to have a dog you know 
 Ah
 Is she
 What is she
 Ah 
 Ah 
 I got my mom a teacup little mutt not too long ago
 Yeah
 Oh for sure 
 Oh yeah
 Yes 
 well my mother has one that's uh 
 uh it's uh teacup 
 and uh it's made such a difference for her 
 But you know just I e- you know 
 the way my mom's presence countenance is just for having a puppy 
 but you know having this dog 
 she's had it for I guess three years now Oh possibly four 
 But uh it's really made such a difference for her 
 I really would like to uh 
 I'm a disabled person
 so I'm unable to really take care of a pet 
 and if that weren't so I would certainly have one 
 I just 
 it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog 
 yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Well yeah 
 uh I typically am not a cat person
 I have a friend that uh has on occasion uh brought her cat over for me to keep you know from time to time 
 And this cat is like no other cat I have ever seen 
 And uh it would sleep on my chest you know
 it's just a great cat 
 but 
 Well you don't own cats 
 Yeah 
 they own you or you know grant you with you their presence you know 
 Yeah 
 I used to have a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life
 I could just walk in the door 
 and she knew whether to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over
 she really could pick up on my mood uh the way I walked in the door 
 It was uh uncanny <>
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Sure 
 Oh absolutely
 Really
 That's the way 
 well I had that cat that I mentioned Alfie 
 One morning you know the first thing you do is you get up and you feed this cat something and you make sure that it can get to its litter box 
 Well for some reason during the night the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through 
 and uh the next morning uh when my roommate got up and uh did not feed it right away it decided that it was going to protest
 And so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket for me looking at me eye to eye all the time while it was doing it 
 All right Have I got your attention now 
 Alfie did 
 I tell you if I could have gotten a hold of that cat that day
 Ouch
 Huh Well that's great 
 it really is 
 I'm glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time
 Yeah 
 Of course you would 
 Really 
 Geez
 Yeah 
 You kind of wonder what really happened
 My goodness
 Well that will make their day
 Only work initially
 For cats anyway you know 
 Well listen 
 it's been a pleasure talking to you
 And you take care
 Maybe we'll talk again sometimes 
 That's my buzzer at the door 
 Okay
 Thank you
