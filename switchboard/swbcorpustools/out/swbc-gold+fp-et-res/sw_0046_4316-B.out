 Uh yeah 
 yeah
 Uh well uh out of control I don't know 
 I guess it could be worse 
 Uh we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood 
 Uh I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington 
 Uh uh there's a lot of problems 
 there's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people 
 and uh you know we get cars on our block uh regularly uh uh uh gone through rifled through and stuff
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you figured it was like Omaha right
 No 
 uh it's not Newark 
 but uh yeah 
 it's got problems
 Yeah 
 I think most people regard it as a warehouse Where you put away the people that are so bad that uh you don't want them out in circulation

 That's what I hear
 Yeah 
 I think you know 
 don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea

 Oh you mean she taught in a prison
 Oh

 Uh well I think the people yeah that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical you know
 I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff 
 and it's uh 
 you can get pretty hardened I'm sure
 Yeah 
 right
 Those are funny labels see 
 Oh yeah
 Oh Oh yeah 
 absolutely 
 uh yeah I think you can blame it on social problems 
 Sure
 you know as poverty has gotten worse as you know education has gotten worse as there's been more single parent families as there's been more homelessness there's been more crime
 Yeah 
 there's not enough beds and treatment programs rising drug abuse 
 and yep 
 it's a mess
 Is he the guy wants to like deregulate heroin or something
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
