 I'm a substitute teacher
 is this Pat I'm talking to now
 Yeah 
 I'm a substitute teacher in I believe the same school system we both work in
 Oh okay
 Oh
 Well I bet you may dress differently then for that
 Well What I wear sometimes depends on how cold I think the school might be or what room I might be in since I'm a sub and have different rooms to go to And always carry a sweater
 Yes
 No 
 you try to layer so you can add or take off
 And it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual uh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 and well for me sometimes they even have dress up days 
 or they you know have spirit week that you wear your different outfits
 and you have to have the color for that particular school if you choose to participate in spirit week 
 And one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some sort of hat
 No 
 but because I sort of stick to several schools uh I'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and might might remember to do it
 And then many schools on a particular day during uh I guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for uh game day which 
 Right 
 it might be Thursday for the high schools 
 and it may be Friday for the senior high schools
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it 
 I see that the 
 I think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than some of the high school teachers I think
 But I think it varies just so much 
 anything can go
 And you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at Clark they're all pretty fancy 
 But they're just sort of into clothes 
 and then there's other departments that aren't
 And they'll just wear your common ordinary you know whatever you might say
 Right
 And so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there 
 you don't want to dress too tacky because you're going to be in the same room with them
 Or you're going to be observed
 Yeah
 Right 
 They go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants
 Yeah 
 well at Vines the coaches don't do that 
 they dress pretty good I would say 
 and then they go to their coaching 
 and they put their shorts on there
 Uh-huh
 But you know they don't wear their sweat pants or anything 
 they dress like any other teacher would in a classroom situation not in P E
 Those I can understand
 Yeah
 I don't think we'll ever get to that
 No 
 I don't think 
 I think we're going the opposite direction 
 It's the parochial schools that I guess many ti- 
 they've had uniforms for years 
 I don't really know if they still do
 It certainly makes it easier to dress
 Uh-huh
 Well it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run I think that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 but I doubt that that will come about 
 Just 
 Yeah 
 I 
 No 
 not 
 Yeah
 Well I think it does 
 it takes their minds off of trying to compete
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I don't think a lot of teachers are very professional 
 but
