 Fine 
 fine
 Yeah
 Okay 
 you go ahead
 Uh-huh
 In public places
 Really 
 What is that
 Um
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well the sentences are so unbelievable 
 I just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months
 Because they just say there's either no room in the system you know in the jails for them 
 or you know it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if a judge has leeway on what he's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and fifty years and you know what's his whim to decide it should be two months
 You know it's crazy
 Yeah
 Well even if it's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life 
 We could spend that money you know for children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that
 So to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt that should be it
 You know particularly for some of these really 
 there are so many just major major serial murders/
 it's not just like one instance or something it's just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on
 Yeah 
 an 
 yeah 
 there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah 
 I heard about that on the news
 Right
 Rather than have to retrial the whole thing and spend all the money for people to uh you know go back to court and all the lawyers 
 and it just winds up costing the taxpayers you know a fortune to keep doing that
 And the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution
 Right 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well if I 
 I saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge I believe from Florida 
 and she just has really stiff penalties 
 and I saw that [ in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved you could have a judge that would really make a good impact 
 But likewise you could have the flip side and have some judge that was paid off or you know had a good old boy network 
 or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through 
 so he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power you know if used wrongly 
 So at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway 
 I don't know if it prevents it 
 but seems like the jury system does have it's advantages 
 But I've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know 
 and I don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers at that point they're really getting a select group 
 It's not just random people
 It almost should be the first twelve people that they you know have on a list are the ones that are on the jury 
 and that's it
 He'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well really this breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors 
 what can I say
 No 
 I'm at home with two little preschoolers/
 My husband works for T I
 Oh yeah 
 I've got the dog and two kids waiting here 
 I'm just locked up in the laundry room /
 Okay 
 thanks a lot 
 Bye-bye
