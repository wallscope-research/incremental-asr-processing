 Well it's kind of a broad subject uh 
 I think there are some areas where we uh pretty well you know get our money's worth 
 but I also think there are a lot of areas especially in uh federal government uh where we're short changed Uh lot of money spent for uh things that are not used 
 and uh I was in the Air Force 
 and there was equipment at every base I was ever on that was just going to waste 
 It was just sitting and rusting 
 you know and 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and I think that uh it's a tone of our times that politicians uh are into themselves more than they are into you know doing something worthwhile for the people they represent which is really unfortunate
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 And don't really respond to uh people who write them and call them 
 and uh you know unless they're in the limelight and under pressure 
 So 
 yeah 
 I think we get short changed on that
 Texas
 That's 
 Well I work for school district 
 and uh it has hurt us a lot 
 Uh there has to be some way I think to equalize education opportunities 
 But uh you know I think especially big government tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it 
 And I don't you know 
 that's just not true 
 you know I don't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or uh problem solving skills 
 Uh I think there are too many things [ that money can't buy that are important as far as education is concerned
 Richardson
 Oh
 Great 
 [ okay
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think Yeah we have got it on the line don't we
 And it's not going to get any better 
 you know it's going up and up and up 
 Uh I used to live in the Plano school district 
 and uh there was a taxpayers organization that uh finally communicated the message I think to the people in Plano that you know we didn't want our taxes raised
 Yeah
 But you know this uh 
 I think living in Richardson we're kind of spoiled because I think we come closer to getting our money's worth as far as the city is concerned I think than probably any city in the country
 Is that incredible
 that's the biggest mess I've ever heard of 
 You know how can you justify raising anybody's salary you know if you have to lay people off
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well yeah I think the teachers uh did 
 and I don't know about administrators 
 I'm semiretired 
 and I was an administrator 
 so you know I don't get a raise anymore 
 I work part-time and just get uh you know 
 my pay doesn't change
 Yes
 Yes 
 very much 
 Uh course I still work two part-time jobs 
 So it's not really total retirement
