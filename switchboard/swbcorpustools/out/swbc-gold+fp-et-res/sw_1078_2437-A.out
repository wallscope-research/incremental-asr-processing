 are you a T I-er
 Oh really
 Oh yeah
 Oh yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 In fact with me it's not much to talk about 
 I'm so much for it 
 I don't really have much to comment about it 
 There've been some interesting subject that they've called about 
 How many times have you called 
 or have you been participating in this
 Oh you got ten 
 well you've passed me up 
 This is about six times
 Yeah
 No 
 I think it's good 
 In fact I don't know what the statistics were 
 but I think that they were surprised to find it so low 
 I think they were expecting to find uh like the national average at T I 
 And I think it was tremendously down
 Yeah
 as far as the number of people they actually found that were drug users 
 But I think that <> when I was at T I of course we had all the information before they started
 And they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs 
 And I think that's what helps you know that in the warning that you have a drug program the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs actually go 
 and then usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything
 Yeah 
 and our numbers have been way down 
 I don't know what they were
 Yeah
 Oh really
 Oh you're 
 that's a good point 
 but at T I before they had the testing I've forgotten seems like it's a year ago September something like that they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government 
 And of course that's critical just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing's got to be you know have a lot of quality control that they keep track of everything 
 They don't make mistakes 
 That would be terribly embarrassing for someone to really come back positive 
 and they were not 
 And I haven't heard of any 
 now I'm not in personnel or anything
 But uh they say that there it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not 
 In other words there's very few mistakes 
 and that of course has got to be critical 
 It's got to be if you have a drug testing program 
 it's got to be with a very very good agency 
 You don't just have some local group do it 
 It's got to be a highly qualified agency
 No 
 you don't want to do that 
 It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check 
 And I think that T I is latched themselves up with an established group 
 And that would be good for any company that does it and not to have just a very casual thing 
 It's got to be with a you know first class totally independent agency Not local of course 
 Ours well I think it was in the south somewhere 
 but it wasn't even in Dallas you know the one that did us
 Yeah
 Oh no 
 They're not fired 
 they have one chance to then go in a program 
 You come back positive you have one chance to go in and go into they have a lot of uh rehabilitation both for alcohol and for drug use 
 and uh they have an agency where you can go for personal problems financial or whatever
 And so they don't 
 no 
 it's not firing first 
 It's uh definitely trying to encourage people to rehabilitate 
 In fact again before you go you know that's why I said when they first started it they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and you may have taken drugs go ahead and get rehabilitated first 
 and they won't say anything about it
 Oh sure
 Oh yeah 
 no 
 that's not right 
 It's really an illness or whatever you want to say that it is 
 You know it's a weakness and all 
 and all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another 
 And I think that those people that have that and however they got into it 
 I have children 
 I always worry about the classical thing that you see on T V where the drug pushers give it to the kids for free you know and get them sucked in 
 and then they sell it to them 
 You know the classical thing is to give it away 
 I always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party 
 and they slip it to them 
 I don't know 
 I don't even have that much knowledge to know whether that would get them addicted or not you know 
 That's a real worry
 Oh you know a lot about that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I know 
 I'm glad of that 
 And I have knock wood pretty good luck or very good luck with my daughters so far 
 that's my conference call 
 I have one daughter still at home 
 One's at U T 
 and one's at home gets dozen calls a night
 No 
 no 
 I don't care about that 
 she'll be on the phone all night
 Right
 Do you have children
 Oh great
 Fantastic experience 
 I've got two as I said I've at U T now in Austin and one at home 
 and I always say that I've learned so much more from them than I ever taught them
 It's a fantastic experience
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 The key thing that I think that we try to do is that bring all the friends over here 
 Have our house as a place where they can come at any time so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome 
 and they're always over in someone else's house 
 So we've been lucky that our house is usually the place where the kids could come you know
 And then you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want 
 But at least you see what's going on 
 and you always have your house welcome then your children think that you know you're cool parents and all that
 Well good luck with your expected baby there
 My wife was talking in my ear 
 she reminded me to say that they're very cheap until they get to start driving
 And we have one of course I say in college driving And one going to drive this summer 
 so kids cost you practically nothing because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything 
 But you wait until they go and get a car insurance that's when they get expensive 
 As they get older you know they cost practically nothing from one to five 
 and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons 
 but it's well worth it and everything
 <> be a great experience really 
 You still there
 Okay 
 I thought I was cut off there
 You know I don't have much to say about drug testing
 So you've done this ten times
 Did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all
 Oh okay 
 I didn't know what they were going to do 
 They sent us a little booklet 
 I just got it a week or so ago saying you know so many calls will be something a prize and everything
 Well that great 
 Well what kind of cash 
 I've forgotten what they going to do
 Was it five dollars a call
 Well hope they follow through and everything
 Right 
 yeah
 Alright 
 Bye-bye now
