 Uh yes 
 yes 
 I have a daughter
 Yeah
 She's only about uh uh a little less than two years old
 No
 Yeah 
 Uh no uh um 
 no particular school 
 Uh I think that's really a decision that 
 They 
 well help them make in terms of you know what they are wanting to do
 You know that's a big influence I think and You know not only what you can afford but what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are
 So uh you know you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do
 Uh University of Mississippi
 Uh well well it was within the state
 But it was not necessarily local it was 
 What's the criterion for choosing to go there
 Uh well at the time I was uh thinking of going pre med
 and in the state uh they had the best pre med uh curriculum for the uh state institutions
 It was choice between there and uh a private college that uh was a bit more expensive
 At the time we really could not afford it 
 so I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me 
 It 
 uh I enjoyed it
 No
 No 
 no 
 it was a six hour drive
 uh it was like another world
 Basically no it was a 
 did not get home that often you know 
 and at that age uh it's kind of difficult sometimes
 Especially if you have not been away a lot that extended 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh that's true 
 Yeah 
 that's like you know when I went on to get my masters you know it was where I was at the time
 You know I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled 
 and I was trying to work 
 uh so when you are first going to school you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go
 Um uh the computer science center
 Uh north building
 Uh about three years
 Uh yeah 
 I have uh uh 
 no 
 actually I came straight from school to here
 So cause this was the first real job after getting my degree
 After my masters
 My undergraduate degree was not in what my masters was
 So I made a career change basically
 Yeah
 One day I would like to uh you know the uh 
 I like the school where I went
 and I would not hesitate at all to encourage her to go there if she wanted to
 Or the school where I got my masters at which was a different school
 And uh I liked it almost as well
 Uh but uh you know that I'm not going to hold them to that just because I went there 
 I you know think that's 
 If they want to that's fine but otherwise not Although I uh would get quite a break on on tuition 
 Yeah 
 because they uh allow for uh uh tuition uh break for out of state students who children of alumnae
 Well certain schools do it
 This school does 
 So uh it 
 I was involved in some uh oh alumnae recruiting uh here in town uh recently uh well last year 
 Uh and it was kind of fun because you are trying to get people interested in your school you know
 And they were 
 this was a college night at a high school in Richardson 
 And it was 
 And there were a bunch of kids you know and a bunch of schools 
 There were a hundred schools probably there all competing for the same kids
 It's kind of interesting to talk up you know your school 
 And I was surprised by the number of kids that came by and had heard of you know our school and were interested in it
 Uh you know we uh 
 situations like that you don't realize you know until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others
 And so I was real pleased with that 
 That worked out so well
 I think so
 I don't know offhand 
 but uh it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there 
 So There was one mother who uh came by right even before we started who obviously was uh very interested in getting her daughter in or having gotten her daughter in or something 
 and she was wanting some more information 
 But her daughter was uh You know a baton twirler or something 
 and she was letting us know how good her daughter was
 She had you know business cards describing her daughter's uh you know she had won several different twirling awards and all this 
 and she had these business cards she was passing out 
 and it was quite a production 
 I think some parents go a little bit overboard
 Yes
