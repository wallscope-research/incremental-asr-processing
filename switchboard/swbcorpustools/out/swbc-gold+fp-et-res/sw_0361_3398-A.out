 Hi
 My name is uh Donna Donahue 
 and I live in Plano Texas
 Oh okay 
 Um do you want to start 
 or should I start
 Okay um 
 I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in 
 We have um three children 
 and um they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports soccer and baseball 
 and well my little girl goes to tap dance 
 and my little one goes to preschool 
 and um I'm home with the children just do a lot of running around 
 It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type I don't know life 
 Um what about you 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Was sort of maintenance free
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 well um that sounds pretty good for 
 I know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends not so much now but to um maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds 
 and it's a lot of work owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it 
 It's 
 sometimes I think um it would be nice to have a town home with not having all that responsibility
 Right
 Oh that sounds lovely
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 So in your area then there's probably a lot of um career type people that have those type homes 
 and 
 uh-huh 
 and um the area that we're settled in is um definitely young families with kids 
 They're still doing um a lot of building in the neighborhood 
 So the people that move here seem to move from all over the country which we're from um the northeast 
 and um seems like a people also don't have any family around 
 So it um also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors 
 you know um But um 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh 
 Now um is it very wooded around where you are 
 there lots of pretty trees and 
 Yeah
 Oh how pretty
 I do miss that 
 Around here in Plano there are very few trees 
 and it's pretty flat and kind of barren 
 and that's the only thing that we don't like about living in Texas is we miss all the beautiful trees and the Fall 
 and um uh the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is you know in the north Um or even where you are
 A lot of leaves to rake up too I bet
 Does that 
 well see that's another plus
 That's right 
 that's right 
 they are 
 I'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done 
 We just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but not much just a little kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks 
 and if you didn't do anything about it then they'd probably the leaves just blow away 
 It's not too bad 
 Okay 
 do we have to speak for a certain amount of time
 Okay 
 Okay 
 It was really nice speaking to you
 Okay 
 and have a happy Thanksgiving
 Bye-bye
