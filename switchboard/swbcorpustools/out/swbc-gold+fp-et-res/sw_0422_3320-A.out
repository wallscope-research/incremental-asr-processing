 We're supposed to talk about crime in the city
 And uh seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays doesn't it
 Well it is 
 but our crimes up here uh as I think it must be in most cities now 
 but uh I was listening to the news the other day 
 and they said they thought the reason it was up so was because uh so many people are without work nowadays 
 economy's so bad 
 That's a good point 
 That's just what they quoted over the news
 I don't know if I believe that or not 
 but it does seem up 
 and 
 What kind
 Well I think we got a pretty good newspaper 
 Uh we have two the MORNING NEWS and the uh TIMES HERALD
 MORNING NEWS seems to have the largest circulation 
 I think it's a pretty good 
 it's a locally owned paper
 The HERALD is owned I think by the TIMES out of uh L A or somewhere
 But 
 Well they don't 
 no 
 not really uh 
 they don't play it up I don't think 
 Uh but there is too much of it you know uh too many homes broken into
 We had our fact about uh 
 last year sometime our home was broken into
 We 
 Yeah 
 we uh uh 
 I didn't think ours ever would be burgled 
 but so many in our neighborhood had been 
 and uh because we live on a corner and back up to a real uh highly traveled main street 
 But uh we were so uh 
 Sort of yeah 
 And I never did get a security system 
 but since that happened I certainly have
 It's uh uh I guess just a standard Uh with uh all the doors and the uh infrared you know motion detector 
 Pretty standard
 Yes 
 yes
 It's monitored and all that
 And 
 I think uh the thing that makes a lot of noise would suffice
 I really do 
 But uh this deal that was part of it for you know three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever
 uh but it uh 
 the monitoring is not that bad though 
 because uh uh we've goofed it up you know 
 several times you'll hit the wrong key not intentionally or something 
 and they call back pretty quickly 
 so you know I think it's all right 
 But I 
 to answer your question uh uh I think uh that is a pretty good deterrent in itself 
 whether it 
 Uh-huh
 Well it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly uh that if it's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway Supposedly
 Who knows you know 
 But that's a selling point 
 And I think it probably does these things supposedly pretty good
 Boy they sure advertise so many of them nowadays
 But uh well don't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there
 I'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's 
 Down here we seem to 
 or not here 
 but the statistics seem to say that 
 I don't know
 Is that right
 I would gather probably from drugs
 And I think that's the reason it's so high everywhere
 But I don't think there's anyplace 
 used to 
 years ago you thought well these little small cities and all wouldn't have that problem 
 but they do
 We've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it uh as anyone you know
 That's a good question 
 I don't know 
 I don't know what the solution is 
 I really don't
 Yeah
 Yep
 Th- 
 and nothing seems to change 
 And uh I'm not sure that anything will because if something could happen to make these people not want to buy it 
 uh but they want to buy it 
 so 
 Supply and demand 
 Long as somebody wants to buy it somebody going to provide it for them 
 So you know I don't know what the solution is 
 I really don't 
 I don't think anyone does in fact
