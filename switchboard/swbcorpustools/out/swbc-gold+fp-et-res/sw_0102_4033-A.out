 So how do you get most of your current event information
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 I would imagine going to college though your professors and different things 
 you keep up on what's going on
 Yeah
 Right 
 Well I'm a housewife 
 I have three kids 
 and so um I get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um talking with people and just hearing what's going on 
 just channel eight 
 That's our channel here 
 that's the um eyewitness news
 So 
 Oh uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 And I think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not 
 and basically you know if a candidate can get them to follow then the news will you know kind of publicize his name
 I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it 
 I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on
 Right
 Right 
 And the news too it just doesn't um cover that many stories 
 it just covers your basic you know violent crimes and your catastrophes with weather and stuff 
 but other than that you really don't know what's going on
 Um I will read our current letters that come out on elections 
 and I guess I do read that 
 and I do study who's running in our area 
 and I do study what's going on in the economy 
 It you know 
 and I guess I do read other magazines um too to get my information
 Right
 I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST
 but um now I guess I just have friends that clip articles 
 or if I you know am interested in something of course when we were in war I read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on 
 But a lot of the times you know I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper 
 but I just can't seem to find the time
 If they put it out in a video or on not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it I would do that while I was doing other things 
 But 
 Right
 Well um they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of 
 and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news 
 You know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas
 that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information 
 Yeah 
 Well I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer olympics 
 I know we're trying to get tickets to it right now
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right 
 right
 Yeah 
 that's another thing they spend a long time on sports 
 and I think um that's fine I would like to see more time spent on other things
 But
