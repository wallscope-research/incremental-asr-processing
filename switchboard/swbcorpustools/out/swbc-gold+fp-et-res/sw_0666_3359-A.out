 Oh I guess uh this is a topic near and dear to my heart since I am a healthy eater
 Well uh I 
 there really isn't any kind of particular food that I don't like really 
 and I like a good Italian restaurant or a good uh uh 
 especially like good prime rib
 so it's uh nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that 
 and I live here in uh Rome New York 
 and there are a lot of good restaurants around here
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Oh no 
 I'm in upstate New York 
 and it's actually very inexpensive 
 I 
 there's a place um half a mile from me here that uh has uh fantastic prime rib for oh eleven dollars for a whole meal you know a potato and salad and soup and the whole nine yards 
 so that 
 Right
 Uh I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever had 
 so I'll have to go there when I get to Dallas
 Uh-huh 
 sure
 Uh-huh
 No 
 no 
 I'm don't do the raw fish like that 
 but I do like uh like like a raw bar like oysters and things like that uh
 they uh 
 I go on 
 I'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business
 so I uh find myself down in Melbourne Florida about once every two months or so and uh go and hit the oyster bars down there quite a bit
 but I love that
 Yeah 
 um and uh Maryland's great 
 you get the crabs
 it's like I can't go anywhere where I don't enjoy myself 
 so 
 That's true
 Yeah 
 well uh it's really strange that seafood is so expensive because in reality uh uh I say that uh the oceans have the greatest resource of food on the planet 
 and yet we as human beings haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically
 so we managed to uh figure out how to get at just about everything else uh but uh not seafood
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 uh I make a wicked chili 
 and around here the big spicy thing is like uh buffalo wings
 and so uh they you know 
 you go out to get the chicken wings 
 and those are really hot and the hotter the better
 Right
 Sure
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 my scalp will start 
 I can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot the weirdest weirdest sensation almost like a tingling 
 but uh I don't know 
 but uh 
 yeah 
 well there isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like
 Things that are kind of oddball like uh Thai cuisine 
 I never been really fond of that stuff 
 You talk about spicy 
 that'll literally blow your head off 
 it's so hot
 uh and I can handle just about any kind of food without uh um 
 well but that stuff goes one notch beyond uh my tolerances
 So Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the uh service in a restaurant is always nice though too
 that's one thing 
 What's that
 Yeah
 Well I find that lately that so many people are you know working waitressing jobs or waiter
