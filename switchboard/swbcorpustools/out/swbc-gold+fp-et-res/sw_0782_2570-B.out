 Why don't you go ahead and start
 I used to uh 
 I sewed you know in high school 
 and when I went to college I think everything in my closet I had made 
 But I haven't sewed since then 
 and that's been fifteen years 
 So uh you know I didn't have access to a machine the whole time I was in college
 And uh my sister sewed 
 and she needed the money so I would pay her 
 and she'd make my clothes 
 uh and then just in the last you know ten or twe- I just haven't sewn anything 
 I would like to get back to it
 Yeah
 It is you know an even back then 
 I remember you could make something for you know half what it cost to buy 
 and of course the quality was just exceptional
 Uh now it's a little more expensive to make it because you know you start paying the price for the patterns and the material
 but it's still such better quality that I think it's worth it
 You're kidding me
 See I can remember paying seventy-five cents for a pattern 
 Uh-huh
 Good night
 Well do you have kids and a husband 
 are you sewing for a whole family 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well and that always is helpful for starters
 You know you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right track of where you're going
 That's true
 Well do you do anything el- 
 do you knit or crochet like for sweaters or anything like that
 N- 
 see I've not ever been a real craft type person 
 I have a sister-in-law that if it can be done with your hands she does it
 She makes things for the kids for Christmas and nephews and nieces 
 and I look at them 
 and I think God you know I should be able to do things like this 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well oh when my sister had her first uh child my niece we're talking fifteen years ago it was my last year of college
 and I asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares 
 So she did 
 and I crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby
 and I started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that I was dating at the time
 And when we broke things off 
 actually we were supposed to get married when I got out of college 
 So when we broke things off I quit crocheting it 
 and I've never picked up a needle since then 
 in fact I think it's still sitting in the top of the closet 
 One of these days I keep thinking I'm going to finish it because it would make a really pretty bedspread 
 But 
 Fast 
 My problem I guess is time you know 
 I talk to my husband 
 we kind of planning for the time eventually when you know maybe I can quit work [ while my + kids because my kids are young 
 I have a three and a half and a two year old
 And he says 
 but Bev I think you'll be so bored because you know all you've ever done is work 
 And I said but there's so many things I want to do 
 I'd like to start sewing again 
 I'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch and these you know knit these things 
 and I think that would be fascinating 
 He kind of laughs 
 I don't think so
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 You're kidding 
 so like as you're sewing the seam it's finishing off the inside edge
 Well that takes all the work out of it
 Well how neat
 Uh-huh
 Well that's neat
 For the machine
 Yeah
 You have to learn how to do it 
 That's right
 Otherwise they hold it over your head forever right 
 Now I bought you that machine 
 Well that sounds really good
 Do you paint or anything like that
 Never
 Oh so do I
 Exc- 
 be- 
 well I have one here 
 it's the one that I grew up with
 and my folks gave it to me 
 and uh a couple years ago when they sail 
 and so they sold their home 
 and they've been sailing 
 and uh so it's here 
 but I haven't touched one like since college so I kind of am picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do it again 
 And of course my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it 
 and I'd love to teach them to play too
 So I'm not great 
 but I remember it
 Yeah
 You do 
 you do
 Well I figure it takes practice 
 and I say I don't have the time 
 that's not true
 By the time I put my kids in bed at night I don't want to do anything
 you know I've worked all day 
 and I come home 
 and I do that 
 and you know even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like that I think gee I could do this or that 
 I have an hour here
 I don't want to do them sometimes 
 I'm too tired
 So I try to save that for the weekend 
 I need to get better at it though 
 Now the part about sewing that I never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out 
 if somebody would lay it out for me then I didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it
 I could do that all day long 
 and I can remember once in high school I wanted some extra money
 and my mom wanted some pants 
 so she laid out the material 
 and I cut it and sewed it 
 and she paid me I think like two dollars a pair to make her some pants
 But I hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and make sure it's on the right lines and not on the bias
 Yes 
 on the grain of the fabric
 It drives me crazy 
 Yeah
 Well what are some of the other features on this machine 
 It sounds wonderful
 Oh okay
 Is that for designs 
 or is that for the regular seam in the fabric 
 or 
 Oh okay
 Uh-huh
 So it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do
 Uh-huh
 So the Serger is not a sewing machine itself 
 It's something that goes with it
 Like an attachment 
 or 
 Oh okay
 Uh-huh
 Well I'm going to have to go check it out 
 That's just something I hadn't heard of 
 but it
