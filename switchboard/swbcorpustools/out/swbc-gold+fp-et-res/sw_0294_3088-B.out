 What do you think about it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else you know harm or injury absolutely 
 And I don't have a problem at all with employers uh testing in the hiring process 
 but I don't have a problem with them too much testing even after the fact 
 but I do a little bit where it wouldn't hurt anybody 
 I don't know 
 sometimes I think they carry it a little bit too far
 But 
 Yeah
 Right
 and then it's not a problem
 Yeah
 Oh absolutely
 Oh yeah 
 Tr- 
 the train drivers 
 Yeah
 I wish they would
 I wish they would 
 and that I think is even probably more widely abused by you know the masses than drugs so to speak
 So 
 Oh I know
 And 
 No
 Just uh 
 Yeah 
 and 
 Now T I has the random testing policy
 and you know our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a pool
 so I've already been tested once when I was hired and once since they initiated this random testing program
 But I work with one girl who was tested her name got randomly selected three times in six months
 and I think that's the only reason I have a problem with it when you know there's no reason to suspect someone you know 
 that's getting a little bit 
 that's enough to make anybody paranoid 
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Either just the lucky or the unlucky one depending on how you look at it
 Oh absolutely
 There are so many people with their petty axes to grind
 it could really get out of hand
 Yeah
 To report it 
 and I guess you'd report that to a supervisor maybe anonymously or something because I would feel very uncomfortable working with someone I knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol 
 I'd feel really uncomfortable
 Yeah 
 we have a lot of people who work on the line 
 I'm in accounting 
 so it wouldn't 
 you know they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something 
 but out on the line they've got people working some serious equipment
 So 
 Put at risk 
 I agree totally
 And in the long run we're all paying for that
 so it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that 
 I was trying to remember there was a court case uh here where I live just a few months ago 
 The city workers they wanted to um 
 the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing
 and the city workers uh took them to court to protest saying that it invaded I guess the search and seizure amendment
 and it's still tied up in the legal channels 
 They haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not
 So I'm curious especially since T Is a local you know employer is also already doing it seeing what they'll say about it especially since 
 Well it's the whole city 
 seems like the whole group of city employees that's raising a stink over it 
 Yeah 
 So 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 that's the way I looked at it 
 If I had something to hide it's one thing 
 but I'm 
 you know you know you don't 
 so it's not as big a deal 
 and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether they're really concerned about their rights or whether they're really concerned about something else
 I don't believe that
