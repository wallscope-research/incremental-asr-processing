 Okay Uh let me see 
 Unfortunately we are not much into recycling
 we don't do enough 
 I know we don't so 
 Uh although lately I've been uh 
 a friend of mine that I spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit 
 and it's uh interesting to watch some of the things that she does 
 and then she's almost had an impact on me uh where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but I can kind of tell it bothers her so just unconsciously I've stopped buying a lot of uh uh paper plates and paper cups 
 and I don't do that anymore 
 I don't know why 
 I just don't just from socializing with her 
 so 
 there's not a whole lot 
 there really isn't 
 Uh I know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio each house has 
 they're given three baskets
 and they put them out on a certain day of the week
 and each uh home does participate 
 but we really don't have anything uh close in this area that do anything 
 and some of the communities that do the residents are having to pay to participate in it Which really doesn't make sense
 Yeah 
 that's good
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 That's another thing 
 You have to go to different places to do that
 Uh-huh 
 But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that Which uh 
 I don't know 
 it just doesn't make sense to me
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 That's good 
 that's good 
 Uh-huh 
 Huh 
 No
 Oh I didn't know that
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well that's good 
 I'm you know 
 unfortunately Garland doesn't 
 I don't know they don't do anything like that 
 or you know I read those little slips that come in to your utility bills or your uh garbage collection 
 and they haven't you know talked about doing something like that 
 She lives in Garland 
 and I'm not sure what she does 
 But uh oh she's very heavy in that 
 and she takes her own bags to the grocery store 
 Uh I really don't think she has any paper products in her house
 Uh and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that to start doing 
 And she does make a lot of sense
 Just her whole house is like wow
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 And uh my little boy watches a program that was really neat 
 I sat and watched him 
 You know the Barney 
 I don't know if you know the little character Barney
 They had one uh on that type of thing 
 and how children can do that 
 and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water 
 and it's really caught on {C 
 and } he's only four 
 and he's really caught on
 And keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing 
 He's really caught on 
 so that's really neat
