 Oh really
 What kinds of things have you done
 Uh-huh
 Do you ever keep any of your stuff
 I do crochet and a lot of uh things like that 
 and I have very little of my own stuff 
 and it's kind of embarrassing 
 People say let me see some of your work
 Oh well can you do it 
 Ooh
 that would be definitely something you'd want to keep
 was the whole face done or just the numbers [ and + and } like minute marks
 Oh
 I did some needlepoint years ago 
 and then I got into the Bargello
 Well it's an Italian um needlework using the uh 
 I started to say the canvas 
 but the uh huh 
 what kind of cloth uses that 
 I've just gone blank 
 But it's used with yarn 
 and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth
 and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors 
 Like it could be a flame stitch where rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or whatever 
 and it was used quite often in the colonial times uh uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel um embroidery work that was done on them
 What I did when I was doing that was mostly pillows you know for sofas and so forth 
 and I can't find one that I've done
 It's one of those things 
 I didn't give them away 
 but I didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves or what 
 and it 
 I was so proud of them when I got them finished 
 but I have no idea where they are
 Bargello 
 It's B A R G E double L O <>
 I suspect you have
 Me too
 Yes 
 That's interesting
 How did you know to choose this subject tonight 
 That's funny 
 What 
 how did you 
 what kinds of decorations did you use with the bas- 
 how were you decorating the baskets
 Um
 Like fabric that's been stiffened
 Yes
 I've seen some 
 and there they 
 I suspect they're fairly simple because the one lady I've seen I know that does it I've never asked her any questions 
 but she has three kids all under the age of like six
 and they're all a handful 
 So it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly 
 When I do um crochet it's usually the lacy Victorian type things like that 
 and I stiffen those with a glue mixture 
 It's like white glue 
 and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then um allowed to dry in those draping streamers I don't know 
 I was just 
 There's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with uh uh high humidity in a room
 Do you know what my concern is 
 How will I dust this thing 
 That's terrible
 So many of my crafts 
 well right now I'm looking at a little quilted uh uh hanging 
 like it's a flag 
 and I don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth 
 but it's such a dust collector to be out and so forth
 And most of my things are dust collectors 
 Uh and I hate to dust
 So first thing I think of is how easy would this thing be to clean
 Oh you don't have time
 You definitely don't have time
 I have a similar problem 
 I've got to have time 
 or I don't even want to get into it in the first place
 And so I end up lots of time not doing anything at all
 You just didn't say which Christmas right 
 What was this project
 Now this is done in the needlepoint
 Yes 
 Yes 
 I do know
 I have done a little bit of that 
 but I decided that that's something that demands my total attention
 And so I've got to have almost total silence 
 I can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate 
 It sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece
 It does not sound like an easy one to finish
 Oh I'm sure you'll get it done 
 but it just may not of the original 
 obviously not of the original time schedule
 Just hard finding the time that can be dedicated
 do you use like a book of patterns 
 or do you go out an buy a kit like for a bib or something like that
 Okay
 Um
 That's what I would do too
 Or whatever I have
 Ooh
 What With ink
 Oh okay
 Oh that sounds really neat
 did you use like uh a stamp pad and ink 
 Ok 
 so you 
 just like being finger printed
