 Definitely
 Uh-huh
 Uh I have twice
 It was a pretty wild experience
 They were just you know small time cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know
 They were civil 
 they weren't any criminal
 Uh the jury uh let me see I think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people 
 so it was 
 they 
 and uh the one changed his vote at the end
 So it became unanimous you know after they turned it in 
 and then he changed his mind after they turned it in
 but it then became unanimous
 Right
 the other case was just traffic 
 the 
 and you know it was seat belt law
 and it didn't even hardly go through 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though
 I wouldn't think that it does from what I experienced in them 
 you know it didn't turn out the way I planned it the way that I would think that it would go
 Yeah 
 but you know it was 
 jury was unorganized 
 and it just wasn't organized enough for me
 I'm not used to it not being organized 
 and I just assumed that it would have been
 That's about what it was
 Yeah 
 well they picked one person 
 and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have
 Yeah 
 it ended up working all right
 Yes
 I don't think that they educate them enough to really know what's going on
 Yeah 
 the bank was suing them uh because they went to get the trailer which was uh seemingly their property
 It was on his property
 Right
 So they came to get it
 And then when they came to get it well it was on the landlord's property 
 and he wouldn't let them take it off
 and it was a double wide 
 so they'd already taken it apart
 So they left it there
 and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it
 So they were suing him for the money 
 and you know there's no way they could because it was the moving company
