 Yeah {F Uh 
 } I don't either 
 uh I've never 
 I don't work at home right now 
 I stay home with my children 
 Uh but my husband works 
 and they do have that at his place of employment 
 and neither of us have a problem with it 
 We've particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and such 
 uh it's a scary thing to know that uh you just don't know what people are doing uh before they go to work 
 So and the advertisements on television lately have been so uh 
 there have been so many You know 
 there's uh 
 just about 
 like train wrecks and things like that 
 I feel like 
 probably just for our own safety when we're traveling and things that would be something I'd like to know that's going on
 Um
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well it's unfortunate I think that everyone doesn't have that opinion 
 Uh uh I've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that 
 but uh in the long run it seems to me it's kind of like what they keep talking about uh the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that you know 
 they feel that's not fair and whatever 
 but you know those kind of things I'd like to know myself 
 It wouldn't be 
 in my opinion 
 I've had a lot of dental work done 
 and the last dentist didn't even use gloves at all 
 so 
 that kind of 
 yeah 
 uh so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me
 Well you would think so
 That is because well 
 and I worked for a dentist 
 and that's uh you know 
 you come in contact with a lot of blood and things like that 
 and it's real real dangerous
 I would think 
 but with all the accidents just with uh everything happening with 
 just 
 airlines just drive me crazy 
 People are afraid to fly now You know just because they don't know what their pilot's been doing and things like that 
 and 
 I don't know
 Uh-huh
 Well and you know if they do find someone who is uh having a problem with drugs 
 and they can get them the help that they need As opposed to just letting the problem go on without any uh support And whatever 
 because a lot of people seems like obviously are trying to hide that uh from their employer and friends and family and things 
 and too many people are just dying Particularly in our area 
 I don't know what the crime is like where you are 
 but the crime rate here is just astronomical
 Uh-huh 
 I just got a piece of paper the other day uh that now they have these 
 I have two very little children under two
 and I got a piece of paper from my husband's office 
 it's talking about these uh drug tattoos now that they have got 
 it looks like a sticker 
 and it's for kid
