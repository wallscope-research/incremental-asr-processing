 Well for many many years uh my wife and I did have a budget 
 Uh we were both working at the time and so forth 
 and uh that 
 we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and other big bills taken care of
 Uh we have a budget 
 but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation
 So uh it's helpful 
 yes 
 having a budget is very very important 
 and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and uh other major things are taken care of 
 and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before 
 so we don't have to have quite as strict uh a budget as we did
 Sure 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I think I do that automatically myself
 I unconsciously uh you know stay with a certain amount because I have enough food already stored here that I don't have to make any large purchase at any one time 
 All I normally do now is pick up little things here and there If the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that
 Yeah 
 we have two freezers 
 and course we have a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff 
 and we freeze a lot of that 
 so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own personal storage
 Well we keep a little note pad on a wall 
 W- 
 if anything is absolutely out make a note of it 
 and then uh the next time I go to the store why I pick it up and fill it up
 So it's worked very well that way 
 That way you know if each of us finds something is missing uh we put it up 
 Uh the other person might not know about it
 That way we keep up to date 
 Uh-huh
 Well actually it's more interesting too if you've got the time
 Yeah
 Sure
 Well I think we unconsciously do the same thing 
 my throat's not as clear today as it should be
 Uh we are uh going to be traveling to Europe with a choral 
 We sing with a so called Pennsylvania choral
 and we make a two weeks tour of uh foreign countries 
 and of course that costs money 
 So we uh 
 each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that we gather together over a period a time enough money to make this trip 
 So that is another way of uh budgeting
 and I think we just sort of unconsciously do it 
 We uh just live a normal life 
 but we don't throw any money away particularly 
 We save it for this trip which is uh always very very nice
 I do the same thing 
 I have a whole pile of them saved that I have found by parking meters 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well let's face it 
 when we're talking budget it is important to have a budget 
 and uh I keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking account 
 and I have a money market account also
 And uh I keep those levels up above a certain minimum 
 and I'm always trying to
