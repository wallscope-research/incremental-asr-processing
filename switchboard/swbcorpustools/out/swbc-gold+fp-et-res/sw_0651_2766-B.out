 Oh okay 
 Okay
 I guess so
 Oh dear that's a hard one 
 That's really hard for me because uh you know I have a son that's sixteen 
 and I think you know eventually you know he'll be of drafting age 
 And I think gosh do I want him to go 
 and yet I'm proud to be an American 
 and I know that we have a country that you know people would give anything to live in a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have 
 And yet I don't know whether I'd be willing to give his life for this country 
 and yet I know [ that I + that 
 and when I was in school it was always the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism 
 but I'm not sure that that's the reason anymore not sure that communism is as strong as it once was 
 And I'm not sure that that's the reason why like we were in Vietnam supposedly so
 Well with the 
 Well it's because of oil isn't it
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 I agree with that
 Oh yeah 
 Well yeah 
 he's uh a bad person very definitely
 yeah 
 Oh sure
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 many years
 Uh-huh
 Well 
 Uh-huh
 Certainly 
 but at what cost you know 
 that's uh the thing it came out wonderfully supposedly 
 everything is 
 and we won 
 Yeah 
 and that's wonderful 
 but what if that wasn't the case 
 What if we would have lost thousands of young men 
 would it have been too much of a price to pay for that 
 I don't know 
 See and I think there are a lot of things that we don't know 
 but that 
 the American people 
 Oh sure 
 Well and there's a lot that we 
 Yeah 
 I think that's true 
 but I think there's a lot that the public doesn't need to know 
 I think there's some things we shouldn't know just for national security sake 
 And you know I think if we did know I think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because I don't think people could handle it 
 So I think there are things that the masses shouldn't know 
 but I also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh my gosh 
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Have a lawyer background 
 yeah 
 Have a law background 
 you're right
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 See and I don't know I can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it 
 I thought the war was going to go on and on 
 I really was surprised when it ended so quickly 
 and 
 I know 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 they were
 Oh sure 
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's very strange 
 Uh and yet you know see that's another thing that's difficult for Americans 
 their culture is so much different than ours you know 
 I've heard from many people that we could not even begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours 
 and um they just don't think the same way we do 
 Their culture is completely different and almost opposite
 Uh-huh
 that's true
 Uh I didn't realize that
 Oh my word
 Uh yeah 
 See and that's another question you have to ask is this our job 
 should we still be there even you know 
 I don't know the answers to those questions 
 I think they're tough 
 and I think you know it's 
 I don't know that anybody knows the answers 
 I think they know what they believe 
 but I'm not sure they really are one hundred percent sure
 Uh-huh
 You're kidding 
 That's unreal
 No 
 No 
 and don't plan on having one either ever
 Oh I'd love to have one 
 but you know 
 Sure 
 Sure 
 That's right 
 That's right
 Uh no 
 I wasn't aware of that 
 no
 For doing nothing 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
