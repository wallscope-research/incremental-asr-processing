 Yes 
 I did 
 it's uh 
 The uh 
 maybe I'm a hard liner 
 but I think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases Rather than uh degrees of sentencing 
 Right 
 Right 
 Uh again having participated in jury duty myself I know how such a diverse group of people get together the different backgrounds different ideas that sometimes you can have one person or two that can hold up what I consider the proper sentencing of the person 
 Yes ma'am
 No problem
 Yes
 Yeah 
 Um I think what you have is the way the justice system works is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty
 So many things in their back 
 pardon
 Yes 
 I know
 my wife participated in a jury trial several years back wherein the individual after it was over and they had came up with the maximum sentence in the jury form they found out that uh the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense which was theft of uh property
 And yet the attorney for the prosecution could not enter uh the good man's background into it 
 It was like this was a first time offender
 Whereas uh I think that's 
 Those that should be in jail should be in jail 
 Yeah 
 <> Well I think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a unsavory reputation 
 shall we say
 Yeah 
 <> Well what you got is the situation wherein uh if you ever get in trouble you want to hire the smartest crookedest lawyer you can find
 And uh that's not the idea 
 the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime that he committed but to punish him for the crime he committed *[[ slash error ]] Yeah
 *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 <> 
 Well we have uh a situation again that I am familiar with where uh the son of an acquaintance of mine was killed while trying to stop a robbery
 And the person that killed him was a young woman who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes carrying a gun in her purse 
 And anyway it'd get to the 
 she was sentenced to jail 
 but then due to technicalities she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced
 Of course it took eighteen months for the trial to happen
 So then uh there was a letter writing campaign that went in 
 and the Parole Board received approximately a thousand letters protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months after killing someone 
 And uh fortunately it worked 
 they corrected the technicality
 And the person now will have to serve three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced to 
 Right
 <> This is it
 and most people don't take the time
 Again the only reason I took the time is because I was personally acquainted with these people 
 I'm just as guilty as the rest in that respect
 Oh yes 
 Well they again the 
 and I'm not knocking the civil rights program or anything like that 
 but we've gone overboard to uh protect persons from having their civil rights violated to the point where the person that is damaged is not protected 
 It's again the victim gets worse punishment then the person that commits the crimes
 Yeah 
 Okay 
 I think we're both in agreement on this subject
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well another side of the coin with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court 
 There are a lot of things that could be settled out of court uh or should never have gone to court 
 And then the amazing thing of course is how uh some cases can come to trial in thirty days 
 and others it takes eighteen months
