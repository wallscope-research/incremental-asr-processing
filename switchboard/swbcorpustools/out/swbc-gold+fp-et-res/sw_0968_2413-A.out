 have you noticed any new uh trends in politics
 Oh really 
 No 
 I didn't hear that
 Uh I think sometimes it's good for people outside 
 They get a different uh perspective on an issue and stuff

 and he obviously failed somewhere along the line
 Yeah
 Oh um I think he's got good intentions 
 but I'm not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right

 to me it's just fair you know 
 it seems like every area should have an equal voice
 No
 Yeah
 Diane Ragsdale
 Yeah
 Yeah

 and I don't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one
 No 
 huh-uh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I 
 Okay
 Okay 
 Good talking to you
 Bye
