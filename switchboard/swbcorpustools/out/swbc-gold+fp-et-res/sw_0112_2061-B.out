 Hello
 Not bad 
 not bad 
 What's your name
 Fernando 
 My name is Nick
 Sure 
 Really
 Phew <> 
 Man I'm 
 No 
 no 
 I'm in Detroit 
 Or not Detroit I'm in uh California
 Yeah 
 I 
 Really
 Oh 
 Well you're on the uh 
 let's see
 Yeah 
 twenty-one <> 
 Yeah 
 Shoot man it's what midnight almost
 Yeah 
 okay 
 All right 
 Well I guess we're supposed to talk 
 what about 
 credit card 
 Oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this 
 and 
 a Masters in uh information systems
 Yeah 
 Where at
 Hey 
 How do you like it out there 
 Yeah 
 Oh 
 Raleigh Durham 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 So it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway 
 Kind of quaint little towns 
 but they don't have a whole lot there
 Uh well I'm in Monterey California right now 
 Yeah
 Two hundred fifty
 Okay 
 it's a lot bigger than Monterey is 
 But we're uh just south of uh San Jose and San Francisco
 And it's only a hour away you know to a large city
 No 
 no 
 it's the naval postgraduate school out here
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Well that's what they look for 
 Whether or not they get it is hard to say <>
 *[[ spelling: "dragged" not "drug" in this case ]] Yeah 
 Yeah 
 It's pretty tough 
 It's pretty tough 
 I 
 uh let's face it you know 
 And you know I you know did the you know 
 as far as 
 I found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know 
 It's what you do You know 
 So uh I don't lose any sleep over stuff like that
 Probably not 
 See I'm in the Navy
 And uh you know most of the Navy funds that I probably won't do it until I 
 if I do do it it will be after I get out of the Navy
 Oh probably be another twelve years
 Oh you know I like what I'm doing right now 
 Excuse me
 If they pay for a P H D
 Nah 
 they won't pay for it 
 I think they have maybe two people a year go get get their P H D 
 Yeah 
 They civilians or uh military
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Well you know a lot of times it's not the money that keeps people in 
 they like what they're doing 
 you know they feel good about what they're doing 
 That type of thing 
 It's more 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh easily 
 I'm sure 
 No 
 Well it depends on what rank you are of course 
 like I say you know if you're at an upper level in the rank category you know you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year
 Yeah 
 Those are few and far between though 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Since I imagine it's fairly competitive 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Too many chiefs and not enough Indians 
 Yeah 
 I don't know 
 that can really slow you down
 I didn't realize that
 Uh-huh
 push paper around 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 they've got basically uh you know a lock on a lot of the market
 And a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know 
 people generally go with that because they figure that you know you probably won't get fired for getting I B M material 
 Where's if you try something different they'll say yeah 
 why didn't you try something more mainline 
 No 
 Uh-huh
 Uh
 Illegal or something like that 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 So in other words that's the way they force people out 
 That's why they can say you know there's no layoff policy 
 But they don't really say that you know 
 you're always going to have great career conditions 
 hey that's kind of sad 
 No
 Well they're the standard right now 
 Or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of I B M a lot of times 
 And the main 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well you know that's a big thing 
 Yeah 
 They are out of Korea right
 Leading Edge 
 Don't they pro- 
 Yeah 
 Small P Cs 
 they're out of Korea right
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 Okay
 Yeah 
 well I've seen them around anyway You know 
 Uh-huh
 Most people do 
 Or they have to anyway
 Uh-huh
 Wow 
 Uh-huh
 It's amazing 
 Yeah 
 Well you know when you get right down to it uh the more they can do for you the more memory they're going to require 
 Yeah 
 both in terms in Ram as well as uh you know standard memory or disk base 
 so 
 Oh yeah 
 You find out more 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Like the deal
 Like a hologram 
 With just graphics on a 
 Okay
