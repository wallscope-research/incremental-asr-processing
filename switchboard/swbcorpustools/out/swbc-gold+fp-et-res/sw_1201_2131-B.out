 What are your music interests
 Me too
 Oh
 Yeah 
 I did too
 and then 
 Yeah 
 uh I'm pretty diversified too 
 I don't like acid rock either 
 I grew up in a small town 
 so uh we only had one radio station 
 so it was country music
 but then uh when I 
 Oh really 
 You're older than I am 
 We don't get Channel Two 
 uh our cable doesn't 
 I wish we got that what 
 but 
 Was it 
 Well we don't get Channel Two
 Oh really
 Now he is a uh 
 actually I did 
 I played flute for almost ten years 
 uh so I appreciate his too his mus- 
 he's from Ireland isn't he
 Was i- 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 he is really good 
 Yeah 
 I come from a musical background
 so uh uh I've played flute and piano 
 so I have a big appreciation for music up to a point 
 I'm getting now to the age where I don't like much of the new stuff that's coming out
 my husband says I'm getting old 
 Do you
 Yeah 
 that's nice to do that is 
 I've got a two year old who's now getting 
 I'm getting well versed in kiddy music 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I was one of the forced ones 
 Oh I could never do that 
 I was never that brave 
 but uh yeah
 Yeah 
 oh yeah 
 I've done that at church too
 I haven't done that in a long time
 So let's see 
 what els- 
 Well what kind of music do you not like
 Oh go- 
 that's not music 
 that is not 
 I don't know what that is 
 but that's not music 
 Well it's not music 
 it's just uh uh talking in a beat 
 it's not exciting at all 
 it doesn't give you relaxation 
 you can't dance to it 
 you can't do anything to it 
 Yeah
 D- 
 Yeah
 Have you ever been to the Dallas Symphony
 Have you 
 Is i- 
 are they good
 Are they 
 I have never been
 Oh really
 I've heard that that is a really 
 I heard that was hard to get tickets to
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that was a real 
 Was it
 I bet it was
 I really bet it was 
 Is that the only uh musical 
 do you go see a lot of musicals
 Yeah
 that would be nice 
 Was it 
 how 
 I don't know what that's about
 Uh uh uh oh I know who you're talking about
 she's got black hair
 Yeah 
 okay 
 I know who your talking about 
 I can't think ever her name either
 Yeah 
 that was 
 I remember that being uh here a few years ago
 Oh oh the last country music 
 my parents still uh really like country music 
 and uh they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Statler Brothers
 and uh well my parents 
 yeah 
 my husband likes uh country music real well 
 and he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah
 and yeah 
 he really likes Shenandoah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well yeah 
 Alabama
 I think they're a bit over exposed 
 I get tired of every other song being Alabama on the radio
 Oh I've never cared for Hank Williams Junior
 Oh 
 Oh we watch those award shows too 
 we enjoy watching the country and the Grammies and stuff 
 but I just don't care for him
 I just never have 
 I don't 
 is it
 Okay 
 I think I know who that is 
 uh-huh 
 I think my parents have uh some of his records
 Yeah
 Wow
 I've heard the name
 Huh
 I've never seen a Gene Autry movie
 Huh
 No 
 I never have 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 those go back quite a way 
 Yeah
 It's hard to 
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 Well that wou- 
 that's neat
 that would be great if they weren't too worn out at the time
 Is there not 
 well you'd think there would be
 Well that's true
 Oh yeah
 Well that's a shame
 because we go to antique stores a lot 
 and you see seventy-eights a lot at record stores 
 you'd think there'd be a market for 
 I'm sure you could find old players for them 
 but that would cost a fortune if you could find them that worked 
 Oh
 No
 Uh-huh 
 Well those things were big and thick weren't they
 You could kill somebody with them 
 And the ones you buy 
 go out and buy one now 
 and they're just so thin and flimsy 
 and they're not meant to last at all 
 neither are tapes 
 we buy cassette tapes
 and machines will eat them
 and so the best bet these days are compact disk 
 those things are practically indestructible 
 Oh no
 Radio
 that's just what you had 
 we- 
 plus 
 I think it was better back then to 
 there's too much T V now
 and the radio is you know more exciting really than television 
 kep- 
 your imagination 
 i- kept 
 and yo- 
 it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does 
 Oh yeah
 Was it on the radio every week
 what day was that on 
 can you recall
 Uh
