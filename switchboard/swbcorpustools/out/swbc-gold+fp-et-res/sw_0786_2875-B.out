 Hey 
 that sounds like a great deal to me 
 You have great aspirations 
 Well let's see 
 we just bought uh a seventy-three Mercedes that we have restored
 and it 
 Yeah 
 it has really been a lot of fun 
 Uh we found some guys that actually you know worked for a Mercedes dealership 
 and uh they also repair them for other the people on their off time so we have redone that thing from stem to stern inside outside you know we've redone the body repainted it detailed it so you know I really haven't thought much past that it seems like you know 
 I don't know if I'll ever want another new car again you know
 Maybe not
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 I don't know it just seems like uh you know for what we've put into it I feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more than you know 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 right 
 the one thing that uh we did decide as it's 
 we wanted it to be as authentic as possible 
 but we did break down and put a C D player in it
 that's not quite authentic 
 but at any rate that was one of the features that I did want 
 I'd passed up on one and put a sunroof in it
 I had to stop there
 Yeah 
 well of course we do it ourselves 
 but like I said we were just lucky to find these guys that do it you know 
 they just weren't really expensive
 and uh yeah you know
 right 
 and they work on it 
 so the things that can be done here they just come here to our home and work on it or work on it 
 so 
 yeah 
 it's really been nice 
 We uh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 You're an American car person
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I have always had an American car 
 and uh I had a real real bad experience with the Cougar that I had 
 it was an eighty-two Cougar
 and uh I don't know 
 I think it just soured me on it for some reason because I had trouble with it starting 
 the engine blew up in it 
 I had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so you know I thought what the heck you know 
 we'll try something different 
 so 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Yeah 
 right
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I would that there's 
 I see a marked improvement you know as far as uh what I've heard about performance and such you know so uh uh hopefully it'll stay that way you know 
 I would hate to see the American car industry suffering more than it already has you know even though right now I'm not driving an American car 
 but uh I think 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 twenty thousand 
 yeah
 yeah 
 Well that's what my parents are avid Cadillac freaks 
 They had uh 
 and I think my mother drives the SeVille now uh I guess it's a couple of years old 
 and uh she had a SeVille before that that had the odd backs that was so uh 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 and it final just wore out 
 they had purchased it 
 I can't remember how many years they had that car 
 but she loved the styling of it
 No 
 she sold it 
 and she 
 Yeah
 I know
 Yeah 
 she kept telling herself that 
 and it's sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because my dad said well just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it 
 he came back with a new car 
 Yeah 
 I think he had an ulterior motive 
 he could just see you know dollar signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went 
 but uh they really are nice cars there 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again you know
 they've scaled everything down so much 
 and uh I've never owned a really large car 
 I don't know 
 I think that Cougar was the biggest thing I ever had 
 and 
 Yeah
 now the Lexus are very nice looking cars you know
 Uh-huh
 That's true
 that's true
 Yeah
 Yeah
 What is what 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I know that uh 
 I've sort of always felt like with Buicks it seems like all Buicks to me look alike you know 
 I guess it just uh seems to me they're all the same shape 
 I have a very good friend that has a Buick Regal 
 and she's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it 
 and that's what she's going to buy again 
 and I'm like oh please it looks exactly the same as this old one that you've got 
 and so I guess it's in the eyes of the beholder I suppose
 Really
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Are they still 
 are what they're 
 what they have out for like the next year is everything still pretty square 
 it seems like the Cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really I can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the Alliance 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Now when was this 
 was this recently
 Oh okay 
 because I have 
 Yeah 
 usually when I see the new cars it's during the fair when I go to the auto building at the State Fair 
 and that's usually when I see anything you know
 Oh I see
 Yeah
 Oh really
 Uh-huh
 Oh my word
 That's wild you know 
 you hear about things like that 
 and you think that can't possibly be done 
 that's just too weird
 Uh-huh
 Right
 uh-huh 
 so you could tell 
 see the inside of them or whatever
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 well maybe
 somebody's finally woken up you know
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 you know if I could fine 
 *[[ spelling "find" ]] I was really crazy about Jags for a while 
 and the convertible had a X J S or something like that 
 and I you know thought that's a dream car 
 and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant you know
 Yeah
 yeah
 Well that's good that you can
 Oh really 
 that 
 oh gosh 
 that's great
 I think it takes a talent to do that you know 
 my husband is uh engineer 
 but he cannot 
 or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it 
 that's might be part of it 
 but uh you know I just say forget it we'll just take it in and get it taken care it 
 He drives a Honda
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well that's one thing that when you would consider 
 see when I go out to think about a new car or buy another car I don't think about well is this engine that I can work on or that you know my husband can work on or whatever you know 
 so you're pretty lucky in that respect 
 Yeah
 That's when you know 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's pretty good 
 it's really been funny because we have like been you are own contractors kind of with this car 
 and when I say we have redone everything I mean we have done everything
 and it's really been so interesting the people you meet because uh my husband Carl has called all over the country you know 
 he's gotten these catalogs try- 
 it's really more difficult to find these vintage parts when you might think this is for a seventy-three
