 Actually I'm real close to being in the market to buy a car
 I've got uh a couple older cars 
 they're both over ten years old
 and uh they've served me well 
 but I kind of would like to get a more uh gas efficient car and a newer model something looks a little nicer
 Uh I've got three children at home Two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old 
 and so I need to make sure I've got one that I can fit all five of us into
 And if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time
 Well uh I've kind of been leaning towards a Caravan
 Uh now I know that uh they've gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years 
 but uh I like the Dodge products 
 and uh uh couple times I've had a opportunity to rent one
 uh I've been really pleased with its performance and with the size
 and because if you get the seven passenger version you can put some space between the kids
 And uh I think that would serve us well 
 Plus it's got uh good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along going to the store
 Uh-huh
 Exactly correct 
 Yeah 
 if you want 
 Yes
 Yeah 
 it uh 
 the Dodge Caravans will do that 
 Uh you can take the uh uh 
 usually there's uh a double seat behind the uh front buckets
 And then if you get the 
 and then there's a three person seat that goes in the back 
 Now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out and just have the three seats in the back and the two seats up front 
 or you can take the uh three seat out and just use the two seat
 or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back 
 So it's very versatile 
 You can move the seats all around 
 About the only thing you can't do is take that three person across seat and move it forward
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think that's getting to be kind of important now that uh the price is becoming the driving factor
 and then you look at 
 once you realize how much money you've got to spend then you start looking around at what you can buy with it where before I think you looked at the car you wanted 
 and then you looked to see how well you could afford it 
 Or how you could afford it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I know they're trying to do everything they can to uh end the recession
 And dropping the prime is probably one of the things 
 I just bought a new house 
 so I got a uh nine and a half percent interest rate
 I'm not sure I could do much better today 
 But uh that is also effecting buying a new car 
 Well that and that 
 Uh two fourteen year olds will be uh fifteen on the fourth of July 
 so 
 Yeah 
 they're twins born on the bicentennial
 You're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial is our motto July fourth seventy-six 
 So uh uh I've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be behind the wheel of a car 
 So America's safe for another fifteen m- 
 and uh after that 
 now I may keep uh one or both of the two cars I currently have for them to drive 
 You know they're small enough that a first time driver could handle it yet big enough that I feel safe that if they were in an accident they would survive
 Know what I mean 
 I don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the Honda 
 They're just 
 Uh-huh
 Is that right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Jeez
 Well 
 Yes
 Definitely
 The thing is that they're 
 I think it's a two part seat belt though 
 there's the uh door belt 
 and then there's one a lap belt
 Make sure you smack him around then 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 uh the supports 
 Uh a good source of information I've found has always been these uh used car manuals because you can flip through the used car manuals 
 and they'll give you a list of all the problems that the car's had in the past
 And you can look at uh the track record on a car over the year 
 and you usually notice uh a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out to where there's fewer problems 
 And you get an idea on how well the next car's going to be 
 Now as long as they aren't changing the model you know like when the uh Pontiac Grand Prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems with the smaller car 
 As long as they aren't 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 sure
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I remember when that happened 
 So unless they're really changing the model uh yeah chances are that it's probably going to have the fewer mistakes than it had the year before
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I agree
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
