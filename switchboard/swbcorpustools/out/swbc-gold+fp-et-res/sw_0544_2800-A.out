 I don't 
 guess we got our first uh credit card oh back in the early seventies when I first got married 
 was a Visa card Uh issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City
 because my sister worked at uh the some Bank Americard center there
 *[[one utt with a3 utt2 ]] So we were still in college 
 and had she not worked there I'm not sure that I would have qualified
 They've come in handy over the years
 Uh and they have become also a real bother sometimes
 Especially you know if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation it's just easier to put everything on a card
 And uh I find if you're not careful you wind up uh a month or so staring those bills in the face 
 and you go I don't remember doing all that stuff 
 and it adds up
 So sometimes uh especially traveling with T I you know everything goes on American Express
 and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping
 But uh as far as personal life goes I guess I really try to use them as little as possible uh
 I kind of like having them for uh gasoline purchases
 Yeah 
 But other than that uh I guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome of just putting everything on there day after day after day 
 and then you really get socked to it if you don't watch it 
 how do you look at counting credit cards
 Well that's 
 Right
 Well that's kind of the way we were doing 
 it's uh 
 I guess for that very reason that uh if you're not real conscious of what you're doing it's just too much by the time you get 
 well if you got a bunch of cards you get a bunch of bills every month 
 and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid
 Yeah
 And I give them 
 maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid 
 because they're 
 know if you don't then they're adding on what eighteen nineteen twenty percent 
 Sometimes it's twenty-two percent interest
 Yeah
 I guess that's one of the motivations behind uh the uh American Express card with T I 
 there's no 
 with the American Express card from T I there's no um late fee 
 there's no uh interest rate
 you either pay the thing off 
 or they come get it
 And it's turned into personnel 
 and they come get you 
 So they've got quite a bit more motivation I think to get paid then some of the others do
 But that's the one that your call center manager sees every month
 so you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that even though you can use it however you want to
 Oh yeah
 You can use it like any other card
 uh but you know you know that somebody every month 
 and who knows how many people are looking at those uh bills that come in and those statements
 you're not the only one
 So uh you want to make sure that uh is that okay 
 is that okay that those people see what it is that you are buying
 and most of the time it is
 But most of the others I've sent back all you get is card offers 
 *[[two utts]] I've got three card offers now uh from gas companies and uh Visa Gold and uh some other bank uh 
 Citibank I think is always sending the Visa stuff out 
 And I usually just throw them away because I I don't want another one 
 I don't want to have to mess with it 
 You know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards
 and uh one of these days it's going to all be full
 Oh that's not bad
 Yeah 
 No 
 if they don't say no annual membership on them I'll throw them away 
 Um *[[slash error]] years ago well I had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for *[[sd]] oh probably fifteen years
 and then they started charging uh annual membership fees 
 and I said adios you know I'm not paying you
 It's just another way to make money as far as I can tell 
 they've been 
 Well sure 
 And I guess they figure they've got enough people out there with cards 
 they're going to get cards at twenty bucks a pop
 There's going to be that much more
 Uh so then a couple years ago I found uh a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership
 So I went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account in his name and got my Visa card 
 so as long as they have no annual membership fee it would be okay 
 but I can't see paying someone to use their card
 Be charged their eighteen percent interest 
 so *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 I think you're right 
 The best philosophy is have them if you need them but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere
 <> Yeah
 Yeah 
 it sure does 
 Maybe they're counting on that 
 I don't know 
 Well I guess that's it
 Thanks for talking
 Bye
