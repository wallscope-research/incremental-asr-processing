 Anyway what are your first comments on that <> subject
 What would you start cutting f- 
 what would be the first thing you'd cut 
 Defense
 Mean private enterprise
 Have private enterprise do it
 Uh-huh 
 They're already talking about it 
 they're talking about uh having it uh as a you know business Uh so you know the government doesn't have to deal with it
 But uh yeah 
 because I think it's all funded either state or federally funded 
 or uh obviously 
 uh But see uh uh you know there's not enough room in these prisons and that uh to continue funding it 
 They think they need to maybe have uh you know private enterprise come in 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 its tough to say uh you know what uh 
 as far as this that good or bad or what 
 But uh I was just talking to somebody else 
 and all those European countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that 
 They 
 so uh 
 No 
 Yeah 
 I know what you are saying 
 But I'm just saying that even the differences uh is that you know some countries pay for students to go through college and etcetera 
 But here you know it's just up to high school
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I think you know that's one reason uh you know we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board Uh 
 they're not willing you know to put you know the training for only a certain amount 
 So uh it's you know as far as the technical side 
 But uh even like 
 one of the biggest things now is like paralegals and stuff 
 they're trying to get more people into that field 
 But they can't just bring somebody in without even having gone to you know school in that area before they can work you know for a lawyer as a paralegal
 Uh-huh 
 Well yeah 
 you know I'm assuming that it can be done Uh 
 my perspective is that you know I've been with a couple of big companies now 
 And it's like they'd are unwilling to put the time in 
 You know they want somebody you know when they bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute 
 Obviously uh you know there's a lot to learn uh after that 
 but uh that's true/
 I'm sure there's a lot of uh 
 you know businesses are you know small businesses that could uh 
 Let me change my channel 
 I've got a cordless phone 
 Let me see if that clears this up 
 <> Is that better
 Okay
 Yeah 
 it was a cordless phone 
 and all of a sudden we had a bad uh frequency there or something 
 So we had some interference 
 so I changed that
 Anyway so uh 
 but uh you know I think uh maybe they need to uh help promote that more Give incentives like uh if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is you know for them to train people you know stuff like that Programs like that you know 
 I don't know you know what kind of options they've got
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think I just heard something the other day 
 it was like only it was either sixty percent or forty percent go to college 
 And then out of that percentage only so many can get their degree
 So I thought that was interesting 
 But uh you know most people I knew have gone and got their degree 
 So 
 Yeah 
 Well you know I uh was basic in a you know upper middle class area 
 and yeah 
 so I think uh that demographic area there you know a lot of them do go on 
 And they go to college etcetera
 Yeah
 Well as far as you know the deficit that's a whole nother uh my perception of the budget you know the government 
 And they have so much to spend 
 and there's not enough money to spread around
 But the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries and that we have you know more money going out and too many goods coming into this country you know 
 And uh you know part of that problem I think is still you know uh 
 like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country 
 and obviously the demand for their goods is quite high here 
 so they can get their goods in here 
 And uh you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know 
 we're going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours 
 But uh it's just that uh they're eh 
 I think you're going to find that just because the United States you know there is such a demand here the market you know 
 And uh uh the you know money being spent and the goods flow in and you know we don't uh sell products abroad as much as we bring in 
 So 
 Uh-huh
