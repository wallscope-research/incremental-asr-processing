 Oh okay
 I see 
 so you make it uh to that Longhorns Sooners game
 Every year
 How about that
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well it's kind of same for me 
 I grew up in southern New Jersey 
 and the local team was Philadelphia
 And they were like thirty miles right up the river 
 and I'm still pretty much an Eagle fan I guess
 Yeah
 Boy uh they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago
 Yeah 
 I keep waiting for the Eagles to get over the hump 
 They make it to the playoffs it seems for the last few years 
 but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there 
 And you know they've got a lot of the tools to do it 
 but doggone if they can't just put it together uh you know 
 they have got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham who's just you know phenomenal 
 but he's too streaky it seems
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and without a whole lot of big name players 
 They have got a few anchors on offense and defense 
 and you know they've managed with those guys 
 and I don't know
 I guess yeah
 Yeah
 I guess since Staubach left they haven't been able to keep it going
 Well that says a lot for his ability though I think For Staubach's 
 Yeah 
 I tell you it's difficult in that guy's position coming into that because there he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things you know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 So obviously though do you think they're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the Super Bowl this year 
 or who do you like to do that this year
 So who's going to beat them 
 Who are they going to blow it to
 Boy they'd some big changes speaking of them
 Yeah 
 I'm sure you know my sentimental favorite would have to be Philadelphia 
 but I sure am scared of them Giants 
 Those guys are tough
 Yeah 
 that sure was a fun Super Bowl to watch this year
 I wasn't pulling for either team
 But that was just a good football game
 Uh-huh
 L A you mean
 Boy speaking of Denver on another subject I've been up there like five times in the last three four weeks
 Yeah 
 we've been trying get this new D N B two thousand printer up and running
 Oh boy I was just up there 
 I just got back last night around eleven thirty or so 
 and it was about seven inches of snow on the ground
 And it snowed all day
 Oh yeah 
 yeah 
 if 
 it snowed that much in Denver you know 
 they got that much up in the mountains you know just west of there
 Yeah 
 enjoyed it Bob
 Hey 
 we'll do it
 Bye
