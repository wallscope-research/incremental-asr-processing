 Taxes
 Do we pay too much
 Well do we
 Um
 My tax bracket is pretty high up there 
 I generally pay the maximum tax bracket
 And uh I think that we're paying too much 
 because I don't have any children
 And I pay a lot of property taxes
 um you know I don't use an awful lot of city services 
 you know it's like I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes
 And um there's so many people who want a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is 
 and I just 
 many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes
 How about you 
 Do you pay too much
 Well uh when you go out into the working world it changes quickly
 Um you look at your paycheck 
 and you go oh my gosh where did it all go 
 Um what kind of 
 uh well have you pay a lot of in ta- 
 have you been out working and then gone back to school 
 or did you go directly from high school into college
 To worry about it 
 have you been active in politics concerning this 
 Have you like worked on political action committees or something like that
 uh I haven't done any of that type of work myself
 Um but every once in a while when I hear up here uh in D C area um one of the radio stations has been talking about the Congress 
 um Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there you know 
 there's a bank that they all bank with 
 and I guess it went defunct recently
 And one of the Congressmen has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks
 And we the taxpayers float him a loan for all those bad checks no interest no repayment schedule
 And um it's causing quite a stir up here because we're so close to D C anyway
 It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur
 Um I think we pay too much 
 And I look at my paycheck 
 and I make 
 well let's see 
 They take out in state and federal taxes 
 I think I pay forty-two percent
 Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government
 and then they charge me sales tax 
 and they charge me gasoline taxes
 and they charge me all these others 
 and it's just too expensive
 I can't believe that 
 I'm just thankful that I don't get all the government that I pay for
 You know what I mean
 have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government
 What are you studying down there
 Physics
 Oh that sounds like a fun field
 Scientific
 Heavy science
 Are you like in the particle research or anything like that 
 or is it more um applied physics
 Okay
 Well maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's come rolling towards whatever it's rolling toward
 Actually I don't think we are
 Um like Europe um England I know the taxes are a lot higher
 But they do have socialized medicine and things like that
 And um I know I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that um they're talking 
 or maybe it was on the radi-
