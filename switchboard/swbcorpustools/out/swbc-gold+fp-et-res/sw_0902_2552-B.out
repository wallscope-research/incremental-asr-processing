 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 You must be a 
 So am I
 Yes 
 what a coincidence
 Yeah 
 I know what family home evening's all about
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 and then the family home evening too
 Right
 Well that's good 
 Um how many children do you have
 Two
 what do you have Five and four
 I have two daughters
 My oldest is uh four 
 and my youngest is about to turn three
 Two girls
 And they are a handful 
 Yes 
 uh well when we first got married my wife worked for a year 
 Then we decided to have kids
 And uh she got pregnant 
 and then we decided she would stay home with the kids 
 We would make that sacrifice 
 It is a financial sacrifice to make because we go from two incomes down to one
 And uh we made that decision 
 and uh so after she had the first baby she stayed home 
 and we had a second baby 
 and she's still at home 
 And so uh you know at work a lot of people are you know 
 I think well this is not a normal situation anymore in our world we live in 
 Most of them uh continue to work if they have kids
 I only have one other person I know in my group here that works where the wife stays home 
 and that's because of religious values as well 
 They're Baptists 
 and they think that's important
 But everybody else works 
 and they drop their kids off at day-care and leave them 
 and I don't know I just don't want strangers raising my children
 Right
 That's how it is at our house when you're on the phone 
 Oh it's open 
 anything goes when mom's on the phone 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Right
 With all the yard work and things like that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 we feel that you know just spending time together 
 You don't necessarily have to be doing anything you know that costs money or you know that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that 
 It's just the kids like being together as a family
 Like last Saturday we went had some errands to run 
 and so we took the kids and and went by the Farmers Market down there in Garland
 And they had a blast running around the Farmers Market looking at all you know the food and tasting all the free samples they were giving out
 And they had a little pen there with animals in they could pet you know/
 and they liked that 
 And then on the way home we drove by the local high school 
 and there happened to be an Future Farmers of America F F A going on there 
 and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything you know all out in this schoolyard there 
 So we just said hey let's stop 
 and the kids got to go around and you know see pigs and animals and things like that 
 and for them that's wonderful you know 
 they thought it was the greatest fun you know 
 and it didn't cost any money 
 And uh you don't have quite as much money when the wife doesn't work
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 Oh definitely motherhood is devalued in this society 
 If you're stay at home and you're a mother it's like what a waste People think you know you should be fulfilling yourself 
 and a mother isn't an important thing as having a career 
 and that should be first and and children second 
 But they don't have what we call an internal perspective of things
 But that 
 No
 Right
 Uh at this point
 It's not to say that some day you won't go back to work 
 My mother's a school teacher 
 and when we started uh having kids she had to work for a little while 
 but then she just started substituting
 So she would just substitute once or twice a week you know just for that little extra money when we were in school 
 Then we would just come home and just you know go to a neighbor's house for an hour 
 then she'd be home 
 But she wouldn't do that every day
 But my uh youngest sister's at B Y U now 
 and so they have no one at home 
 she's back teaching school full time now again 
 So it's just a temporary thing
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 yeah 
 it's hard sometimes at work because you know people say oh we're taking a cruise 
 we're going here 
 we're going there you know because they have a lot more money 
 And a lot of them decide just not to have children
 it's amazing they either have one or none
 and the one person I know that has one they feel guilty 
 She has this continual guilt trip that she's not doing the right thing 
 and so uh on weekends she would you know spend all of her time with her kids and spend lots and lots of money 
 Basically I think they really spoil the child to try to overcompensate for their guilt feelings 
 and they don't want to have anymore children because she doesn't think she could be a mother at home 
 That's not her bag 
 So she just doesn't think that she could you know 
 the guilt feelings she can't deal with it anymore 
 so 
 You know 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 my wife uh likes staying home
 Uh she works at home some though
 The place she worked with before um worked out an arrangement with her where she can work at home part time 
 and so uh it's kind of a seasonal thing 
 Three times a year she's really busy doing certain things based on that kind of business 
 but the rest of the time she's free 
 She likes to sew and do crafts and things like that 
 So she enjoys staying at home 
 but uh the money part of it is not as rewarding obviously 
 but there's different rewards you know different kinds of rewards
 Right 
 right 
 right
 And you really have to make uh quite a bit of money 
 The wife doesn't make it worth it with the cost of day-care
 I know there's you know 
 when you adjust your income for what you put out for day-care you know you're only making like five
