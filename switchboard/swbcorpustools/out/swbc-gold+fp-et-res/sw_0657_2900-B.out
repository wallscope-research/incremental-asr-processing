 Oh
 Yeah 
 because when people can't pay they end up going to clinics or you know to public hospitals and that kind of thing 
 and you know 
 Oh definitely 
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 that sounds like a good idea 
 My only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government 
 I don't know 
 Do they wind up with more red tape and more problems then 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Yeah
 Wow
 Yeah 
 Well I think part of the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money until you know they have no preventative measures 
 People um you know just go on and on and on 
 so many people don't even get prenatal care 
 and it just extends what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had help available early on 
 becomes just this horrendous you know burden on the taxpayers 
 They're saying now that one out of every ten child born in public hospitals is addicted to crack
 Well you know 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Oh it's unbelievable how much you go through 
 When I just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar CAT scan a chiropractor got it in one time 
 it was just strange 
 Oh well that should help
 Yeah 
 Oh I see 
 Oh gosh
 Okay 
 well 
 Okay 
 thank you 
 Bye-bye
