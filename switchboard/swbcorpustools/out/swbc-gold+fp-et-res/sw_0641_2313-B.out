 Um I've got about four maybe 
 I try to limit them because I don't use them too much 
 And I use my Visa just for about everything 
 and I pay it all off 
 So I try not to 
 I just use it for free money for thirty days basically
 you know I'm in the age group you get out of college 
 and I think a lot of these people have them maxed out
 Um I don't think I ever tried
 Um well 
 yeah 
 I you know 
 it's you know feasible 
 I know a lot of college kids you know who had them but just depends
 Yeah 
 so basically if you want to take the risk 
 It's your risk 
 do you trust your son
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I'd say you know have one with you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something
 Uh-huh
 the extended loan payment for your car
 Yeah 
 I saw that
 Well it's business 
 and they're making money off that
 Yeah 
 so it's business 
 and you notice that they're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old
 And so they've already shifted the risk 
 If they assume that car then they just have to sell it themselves 
 and they'll recover the loan
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 uh
 now what's ten percent we can deduct
 I didn't know that
 I didn't think you could 
 any thing on a mortgage I know you can
 Oh I've never itemized yet
 So maybe that's Schedule A or 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I just try to stay out of debt 
 and I use my Visa for as much as I can 
 and I pay it all off 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Hell I took a five year note out on my car right when I got out of college 
 and uh I'll never do that again 
 I still got a couple of years on it to go 
 and I'm 
 Well you think you're starting out well until you start paying all those bills Uh apartment rent 
 and 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 so 
 Um
 you know they're convenient you know 
 that's probably one big thing about them 
 and uh 
 Yeah 
 well I was used to using my credit card like at Skaggs Alpha Beta in Dallas and stuff
 and now I'm out here in Phoenix
 they 
 none of these grocery stores take any credit cards 
 so now I have to carry cash when I go to the grocery store which is new to me you know 
 I got to have sixty bucks on me or something
 So uh that was interesting cause I always you know 
 you didn't have to worry about carrying that much unless I knew I 
 Yeah 
 I've heard about them
 That's mostly locally 
 the banks will line up with uh 
 Yeah
 All righty
 All righty 
 Take it easy
