 Yeah
 Uh uh I tend to agree with you uh you know 
 probably pretty similar views on it 
 but that's one of the things I don't understand is so much of the controversy 
 because uh you know I do also myself believe in capital punishment uh 
 uh you know it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the State when they so callously and usually you know without even thinking or without any concern uh you know end somebody else's life and in a lot of cases several people's lives
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 that's kind of the way I feel 
 if you've got a guy who's been to trial and has been in and out of jail you know basically a three time loser for the twelfth time you know and he goes out and kills somebody he's not going to be reformed 
 he's not going to get any better you know 
 it's just not going to get any better 
 and the only thing you know 
 a lot of people have the opinion you know don't have capital punishment 
 but give them life in jail 
 and you know I could go along with that if I could be assured that it would be their natural life in jail and not parole after ten or twelve years
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 it's just our criminal system is just so I guess overloaded 
 but the problem is not so much with the prison system you know 
 because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws 
 and the prison system are just you know 
 they're trying to cope with them 
 but you know the thing about capital punishment I you know 
 a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent uh to future crime 
 and the way it is now it's not
 Because you know you 
 if like 
 the State of Texas for example uh you know may execute somebody twice a year 
 You know that's no kind of deterrent because we've got literally hundreds of people on death row and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row 
 and that's certainly no kind of deterrent 
 and I would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it's not a deterrent because it's not
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's amazing 
 uh there's a girl I work with our secretary as a matter of fact 
 her father was murdered her father and three other guys up here in Sherman 
 And uh the guy that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death you know he's been on death row for like eight years
 And you know this was her father uh you know that got killed you know just cold-blooded murder him and three other people 
 but still for some reason you know this guy's sentence has not been carried out you know 
 he's sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people 
 and the State still can't bring itself to execute this guy
 It does 
 it really does you know 
 She and they have to go back uh 
 occasionally you know she has to write letters to the parole board and you know lawyers 
 and just ever so often she mentions well she's got to do something else you know write another letter or do something 
 It's just 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 you know she should be getting on with her life you know getting that part behind her 
 but yet it's kind of tied to her the way it is now
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 right 
 A victim 
 not only indirectly of the crime but also indirectly by that indirect involvement 
 it's ridiculous
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 it's terrible you know 
 and 
 Yeah
 Oh that 
 oh man I couldn't be a cop for that very reason you know because they do 
 the criminal gets right back out 
 and you know the cop's just got to go back and do his thing all over again because so many of the crimes are done by repeat offenders
 It's 
 Yeah 
 No 
 All right 
 Ron we'll see you later
 Bye-bye
