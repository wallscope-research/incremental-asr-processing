 Oh 
 And how big is it 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 well what's included in that
 Like washer dryer or 
 Nothing
 Wow 
 Yeah 
 Which one is it
 Where is tha- 
 Oh okay 
 okay 
 Yeah 
 I used to live in Waco 
 so 
 Yeah 
 yes 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 uh we live in a house here
 and uh it's a three bedroom two bath
 and uh I don't know 
 I got two numbers today 
 actually we were talking about mortgage insurance today with my agent/
 and uh it's about sixteen hundred square feet which is fine for the two of us
 But you know we looked at a lot of houses that had more square footage
 but they didn't use it right you know
 It was a bunch of empty you know hallway and stuff that cur- 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 really 
 So we've used every bit of it 
 and our house um we bought it for sixty-four
 and uh the neighbors house next door to us sold for seventy-five
 so you know I think we you know got a good deal on it
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Oh really 
 my husband's from New Jersey 
 Yeah 
 that's what we were looking for the first thing
 Wow 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 But that's what we had uh uh 
 that's what we had looked for was our main concern was a big living room you know and big closet space you know
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 And uh so that's what we went for first 
 and we just have a big living room 
 and a dining room is separate
 and you know some places have 
 like the house next door to us that we looked at had a living room a dining room and a den
 But to stick a wall between two rooms didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den
 So we opted for the just the whole wide room that went from one end of the house to the other just about
 Yeah 
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 right 
 I think for where we are um I think we got a real good deal on it 
 and you know we have a 
 uh the backyard is just huge
 It is just really 
 I think another house could fit back there
 And uh we really liked it 
 of course when you have to mow it You know in uh middle of August it's kind of a little hot 
 yeah
 But uh it's nice 
 and that was you know a big selling point too 
 and I think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us
 And they've lived there and have it all built up you know
 they've got a whole garden and trees and everything 
 so it's not like we're uh kind of secluded you know
 we don't have a neighbor's fence coming up to ours You know right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is Like a lot of the little model homes that they you know throw up in three days
 And uh 
 No 
 no 
 not at all
 in fact uh we talked about that just a little bit you know
 we were joking around about uh <> winning a sweepstakes and what would we do with the money 
 and Steve said we'll I'll buy a bigger house 
 and I said no I would just fix this one 
 You know you know cause I like where it is 
 and I like how it's laid out 
 and it took us forever to find it
 But when we found it we knew it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Where 
 Oh okay 
 Oh okay 
 Right 
 Right 
 Um
 Yeah 
 and that's one thing is once you know you get into a house it's like you get more stuff
 and to put it all back into an apartment would just never work 
 God I can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff 
 and it actually fit you know
 Of course we got it on a little bit of more furniture and stuff 
 but it was just unreal
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 and that's 
 actually three fifteen over there's probably not real real bad
 for Waco 
 and for gosh as many apartments and condo's are over there
 it's just 
 and especially around Lake Shore area that area's picked up quite a bit since we were there 
 and uh 
 Yeah 
 because I had lived in the 
 gosh I'm not sure what they're called now 
 but they were Lake Shore Apartments that are like right next to the M C C Baseball field 
 but No 
 the ones next door to those 
 there were Lake Shore 
 there's a 
 I don't know what they look like now
 Yeah 
 there was a nursing home 
 and then there's an apartment 
 and then there's another apartment
 And we lived in those third ones 
 and they we moved in when they were brand new uh you know 
 we drive by now and think gosh you know look how much it's changed 
 Oh every now and then
 it just 
 we 
 It's uh 
 yeah 
 and it's not really 
 now that it's sixty-five it doesn't take hardly anytime to get there you know run to the mall or run to Sam's or whatever 
 We used to run to you know Red Lobster 
 but now they've got one in Killeen 
 so 
 we don't have to run that far 
 So that's about how things are 
 and seems like the market here's picking up
 Yeah 
 I really think it is
 Just for the fact that the you know 
 it seemed like as soon as we bought this house we saw all these houses for sale you know 
 and I think now a lot of them are selling 
 and a lot of sellers are getting close to what they want instead of you know just having to give it away
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I see that a lot too there
 And it's nice too
 I liked living there
 Well 
 I guess we chewed up the house market and apartment market for a while
 You too Tanya
 All right
 Bye bye
