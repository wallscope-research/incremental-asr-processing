 Well uh I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in this uh very specific examples such as uh transportation workers as in uh air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing
 Um I don't really think that it's uh too many 
 I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're uh you know worthy of working for us 
 I really don't see that that's a very valid uh thing for a company to say 
 and personally I don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body
 Well I think the problem here is that a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
 There's too many cases where it can you know 
 there can be false positive results and that sort of thing 
 I don't think there's any definitive you know 
 okay this person is taking drugs 
 so we don't want him here
 Uh like I said some industries though I think it'd be very necessary 
 I wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I'm flying in an airplane
 But uh I find it to be pretty offensive that it's such a big deal 
 if your employer's not going to trust you 
 or you know it 
 I think it's a whole trust issue 
 I just can't see it
 Uh yeah 
 I have been 
 I was very offended by the whole process
 it's very humiliating 
 and I'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs 
 but uh I am totally against that sort of a uh 
 it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want to look at your urine before I'm going to talk to you
 Right
 Yeah
 Right
 Right 
 that's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just you know 
 I was in the same sort of situation as 
 it was a job interview 
 and then you had a physical where you were drug tested 
 and it's 
 I just 
 and I know people who have been drug tested and who have not you know been hired by a corporation which uh you know 
 I really 
 The other side of it is besides its being an invasion of personal privacy it's my bodily fluid 
 and I don't really want you to look at it or something pretty basic like that 
 just to the fact that I don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what it's employees are doing when they're not at work 
 I mean during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there I think they have every right to say these behaviors are acceptable and these are not 
 but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work I find that to be fairly offensive also
 Right
 Right
 That's exactly right
 And also I just think it gets a lot 
 I'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies 
 and I think that it just moves down along a line that I really would find bad if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work you know 
 there's already talk of people 
 well we're not going to hire you if you smoke
 Well you know I can see how they can say in the work place you don't want them to smoke 
 but when somebody leaves work I don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all
 Uh I really think it should be except as I've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times 
 And other than that I do not think it should be allowable 
 I think it should be illegal for them to want to do that 
 it's kind of the big brother syndrome 
 I just 
 anything like that just kind of scares me
 Right
 Right
