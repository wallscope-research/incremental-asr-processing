 Yeah 
 Well twenty-seven up
 And we had five
 Oh yeah
 And how about yourself
 Oh 
 well 
 Yeah 
 Well when mine were growing up I did some traveling but not that extensively 
 but I always just made it a point you know to spend about ten minutes with each one of them
 So it was an hour you know 
 But whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them
 Six years
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 We look back and wonder how we did it
 No 
 she never did
 
 Well yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Well that's plenty though 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 Well you know with kids you're not going to have a neat house
 And you know it's tough to find time especially with both of them working
 And you just have to set the time and say okay this is going to be it
 Right
 Right
 Well that's good too 
 Yeah 
 that's good that way too 
 Yeah 
 Well they say all it takes is about five ten minutes a day
 you know and as the kids got older I made them you know help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too Or whatever 
 and 
 Oh yeah
 And uh well yeah 
 if 
 Yeah 
 Just keep them talking that way 
 But uh another thing we used to do is have family councils Every Sunday night
 Discuss everything that didn't agree with them 
 And we'd take turns being president
 And everyone would get one vote 
 And I always thought we'd get outvoted five to two
 but it never worked that way
 Yeah 
 Well and we could bring up stuff too
 And that was always good time 
 Boy we really got to know the kids well
 Oh yeah 
 In fact they were all in uh over the weekend for Easter
 Well we did too
 And I remember the one daughter saying we had a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree
 and she said hey I don't make <> fun of your friends 
 so why make fun of mine
 kind of hit us between the eyes
 No 
 But that was always good quality time for us
 And then never attend 
 but if they missed it they had to abide by the rules
 Yeah 
 and boy they'd show up
 And we'd usually take notes
 and you know the younger kids uh or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another
 uh but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us 
 And they loved it
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 But uh boy I feel for you and your husband 
 Well uh two of my uh
