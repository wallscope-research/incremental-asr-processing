 Oh I start 
 Okay 
 Well uh we keep a budget to an extent
 Uh and we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm paid once a month which sort of forces some uh uh restrictions 
 and you need to make sure all your bills are paid 
 Uh about yourself
 Yeah 
 Well I guess that really is sort of uh keeping a budget 
 you know You stay uh within your means
 Yeah
 Yes 
 Oh you moved from Dallas to San Francisco 
 That is a hugh difference
 Yeah
 But you have good sour dough 
 and it's a beautiful place to live 
 Yeah
 *[[ Labelled as an indep slash unit since A's next turn is so voluminous before B24 ]] Uh-huh
 *[[ See B22 note ]] Yeah 
 Well that's a system too
 Well then again you know you said you are able to take trips 
 And you do obviously have enough to live on
 so I guess you're indirectly budgeting Uh just bye-bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal uh in spending the money 
 So that's a form of budgeting I would think <> 
 it's kind of a strange topic for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money
 Yeah
 Uh well we have one on the way
 Uh my wife 
 and then we're having one on the way uh in uh September
 No 
 I think it's just going to be one
 How about yourself
 Oh 
 Do they budget at all 
 do you have them on an allowance 
 Yeah
 Yeah
