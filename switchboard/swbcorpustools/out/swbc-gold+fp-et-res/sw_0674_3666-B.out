 Yes 
 I forgot we had to hit one 
 Our time will be up
 Well just go ahead and talk 
 that's all
 Yeah
 I don't think so
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden 
 Uh-huh
 Good
 Uh-huh 
 you're ahead of me
 That's better
 Oh that's really good
 Yeah
 I don't do any of that
 Really 
 well I call my lawn man Eric whatever his name is I can't remember Who's going to come and build me a fence too
 Well he's giving me an estimate
 And for ten dollars a week I don't see any reason for me to be doing it 
 No for my yard *[[needs slash unit]] Yeah 
 he is
 Yeah 
 but ten dollars or what does he charge not even that 
 What does he charge me 
 It's like next to nothing 
 it's ten because I 
 it's forty a month
 But if there's five weeks I still pay forty
 Well he won't pull weeds 
 He says he'll spray them 
 but he won't pull them
 Uh he won't cut them is what he won't do Because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the trimmer over the rocks 
 and he's right
 That's true 
 But he just says to keep spraying them so
 Anyway Gene sprayed them once or twice for me 
 so that was real 
 No
 No 
 There are two out front 
 I thought I'd grab one of these days 
 but I haven't bothered as I walk on by
 I started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front
 and all of a sudden I came cross this big clump of weeds 
 and there was dog dirt in it
 and I threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there 
 and I left the whole thing 
 and that was about a month ago 
 I would rather a snake 
 no 
 I just left the whole thing 
 The bag is still out there because I haven't touched it
 I haven't gone back over there 
 It really made me mad
 So anyway but 
 Oh yeah 
 now they died
 I don't know
 I don't know 
 and then I got some nice uh mums at Thanksgiving that I put in the pots out there
 and I thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather
 They looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas 
 then they started to die too
 So I don't think any of it comes back 
 but I don't know 
 maybe these 
 sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to
 So 
 Yeah
 Really
 Well that's good 
 They're the best kind
 they're like indestructible
 They really grow nice 
 and sometimes they're not supposed to come back 
 but lots of times they do
 So 
 We'll see 
 They're letting us have a lot of time on this aren't they
 But that's because we didn't hit one for a long time
 I hope not 
 Neither one of us is getting paid for this
 Yeah 
 really 
 I know it 
 I can't believe this 
 I got somebody from Utah and somebody 
 where was the person last night was from far away
 And we get each other down the street 
 This is so funny
 Yeah 
 I've had Dallas Arlington 
 I've had uh one Plano and then a lady from Brigham Utah whose son lives in Plano on Ranier someplace And then uh another state 
 I can't remember 
 but she told me about the Utah Jazz 
 we talked about basketball
 And I don't remember what the place was last night 
 but I'm thinking Colorado 
 but I'm not sure 
 I'd know the place anyway
 So 
 But mostly they're from the area
 It 
 Not for me
 You know not for me because all I have is rocks and weeds
 I know
 I know 
 we're not typical Texans
 Bu- 
 I don't know 
 I hope so
 Come on 
 come on
 I don't know
 I know 
 Well we can talk about something else 
 It's just a suggested topic
 So how's the baby do you think 
 How's the 
 Let's talk about the baby
