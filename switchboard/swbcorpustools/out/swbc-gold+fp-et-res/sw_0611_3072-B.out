 Okay
 Recently 
 my most recent trip was last year 
 and that was Detroit
 Yeah
 Well it wasn't really 
 It was um uh to see an old relative
 And it was uh just to uh have some fellowship with her
 No 
 The only thing that I visited that you know is quite a tourist spot is Cancun Mexico
 And that was real nice Uh
 No 
 we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there
 Yeah 
 and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit from our daily routine
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Oh that's always refreshing to get away from
 Oh well that's nice
 Yeah
 Well uh my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity 
 and that's canoeing
 And uh they've been to the Guadalupe River 
 and they also uh uh have been to uh I guess Colorado 
 and they've really enjoyed it
 It's a whole new 
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's neat
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Well you learn a lot of um skills too 
 and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older to learn new skills
 and I think it really penetrates in your memory you know what to do because you really have a great interest in it Because it's something you weren't forced to do 
 so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning
 And you're more receptive
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's exciting
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I had a friend that uh visited England well I think it's been probably two years now 
 but that's her next goal {A and she can do it } is go back to England 
 because she really has a great desire to do that 
 because the love that she um has for it now after visiting it 
 Uh-huh

 Do your own thing
 Yeah

 That's wonderful 
 There's a lot out there to see
 I'll say 
 Well I lived across the street almost from Canada 
 So that's a nice place 
 Canada is very nice
 Uh-huh
 Oh yes

 Sure 
 somebody that knows their way around
 Well you've been quite a few places there 
 Once you think about it huh

 What did you wind up with 
 Oh okay

 They kind of guided you
 Uh-huh
 Well good
 I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement so when we do have the free time we'll have the means to uh pursue our dreams
 Yeah 
 I guess that's what retirement is all about
 Yes
