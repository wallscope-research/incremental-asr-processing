 Okay 
 Mike I guess we'll be talking about painting recently 
 Any kind of recent painting you've done uh yourself 
 Have you done any recently
 Uh-huh
 Wow 
 wow 
 that's quite a chore
 Yes 
 I imagine it did 
 Did you have that done professionally 
 or did you do that yourself 
 Did you enjoy that
 Oh that's fun 
 We just recently uh had our boys' room 
 our two oldest boys share a room 
 and uh the paint has uh kind of faded and deteriorated 
 and so we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth 
 and uh looks quite good 
 We were quite pleased with the result
 Yes 
 it's a project uh that I did 
 yes 
 and uh 
 Well 
 I don't think it's sun exposure 
 but uh boys will be boys 
 and there were crayon marks on there 
 and we had to scrub the crayon marks off of course try and get it clean
 Pardon me
 Yes 
 it was 
 It was latex paint 
 and that's uh what we put back on there was a latex paint
 Plus uh they had bunk beds 
 and one of the younger boys when he was younger about three years old uh got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures 
 Yes 
 on the ceiling
 And uh you scrub and you scrub 
 but you can't it all off 
 And so that's one of the reasons why we painted 
 and uh 
 We used a flat latex paint
 and in the bedroom as I understand that's uh one of the better type of paints to have because it's not so reflective and glassy colored 
 and it uh turned out real real well
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh you had to prime it and cover over it
 Huh
 Well I like to use this Sears uh the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee
 Yeah
 And the reason being is once I painted I don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later
 but uh 
 and uh we're quite satisfied with that
 and occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale 
 and we do that 
 In fact I was just reading an article 
 you mentioned painting your bathroom
 I read an article recently that uh you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to peel or come off because of the high moisture content in your bathroom 
 And uh did you have any problems with that 
 or 
 Oh good
 Uh-huh
 Oh good 
 neither have I 
 Oh good
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 uh have you ever used an oil base paint
 Uh-huh
 why do you use that 
 I'm kind of new at this 
 but It adheres better or lasts longer
 Oh okay
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Well that's good 
 that's good
 Uh have you ever done any painting outside
