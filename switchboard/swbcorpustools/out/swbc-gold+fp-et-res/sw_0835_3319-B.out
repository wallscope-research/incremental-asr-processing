 Well yes 
 I am as a matter of fact
 Not a good one 
 but I am a golfer
 I uh haven't been out all year 
 I didn't get out this year 
 but uh I enjoy both watching it and playing it
 Yes 
 and the peacefulness
 And the little critters that are around
 That's right 
 and it's such a personal challenge
 More than competitiveness against someone else 
 it's a competitiveness against yourself
 Well you'll 
 Or you'll hear thirty and think boy I got my game together 
 I've had a par and a birdie and a bogey 
 and then you quadruple bogey 
 Being down there do you uh get to see like the colonial or any of those
 Oh
 You really should go at least once 
 You know we've had uh the P G A up here
 Uh Tulsa 
 and I've been to both of them 
 and it is so much fun to see these players you see on T V and to hear that ball go whizzing by
 it's like a bullet going by
 And you know to see their concentration and yet to see how friendly they are when they're walk by you you know and how good they are to their spectators
 Both 
 Yes
 Yes 
 it is
 The scrambles are fun
 I belong to the country club there in El Reno when I lived there 
 and it's fun because it's so uncompetitive
 on those you really go out for fun
 And you know you won't 
 you know you're stroke is just one of one or two or three or four you know that's going to make any difference
 That's right 
 when I worked at Kerr McGee I used to play in their tournaments
 And uh now that was very competitive
 And I enjoyed it tremendously 
 but uh I think I get more enjoyment just couple friends going out
 And if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green so be it
 You know we just think well the next time has got to be better 
 Oh yes 
 every hole
 Does your club have a good woman's association
 It's hard to be a weekend golfer and improve your game
 it's a good game 
 uh I wish I had more time to play 
 and I felt you know had more energy to play it too
