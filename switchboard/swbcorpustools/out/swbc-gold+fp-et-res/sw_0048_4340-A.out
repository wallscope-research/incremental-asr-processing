 What kind of crime do you think uh is the most prevalent in our society
 Such as New York City 
 Yeah 
 I wonder uh if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because so many people use it 
 and even though just using is not really 
 it is a crime
 Well that's true
 But I was staying in the realm of felonies versus misdemeanors and uh drug use 
 well actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor 
 but uh what kind 
 uh have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything
 that's not that much 
 you know those aren't 
 I 
 Yeah

 And society probably too
 just general society to 
 Uh
 Yeah 
 it does

 but usually they aren't
 They're spur of the moment
 and uh the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those individuals I think that you you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time
 Yes 
 they would have no problems doing it again
 Uh-huh
