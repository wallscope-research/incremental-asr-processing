 Okay
 Okay 
 well we subscribe to PEOPLE magazine and to TIME 
 and of course I like the PEOPLE magazine because it's gossipy and it's fast reading 
 and uh the TIME of course is uh you know more newsworthy 
 and uh it has more world affair type things of course 
 And then I will purchase a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING occasionally especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and things like that
 and uh do you subscribe to any magazines
 Uh-huh
 you probably have smaller children younger children 
 our children are grown
 and uh I'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren 
 Well do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to
 Yes 
 now my husband does that 
 and 
 you know and of course uh naturally WALL STREET JOURNAL you know and or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED 
 but I don't know 
 I know a few people leafing through them at the store 
 but you just don't hear people talk about them 
 and I know years ago when uh my children were young and stuff I just loved LADIES HOME JOURNAL McCALL'S GOOD HOUSEKEEPING 
 and I took them all
 and uh then oh I don't know what 
 in the seventies maybe late seventies they changed their format
 and I haven't 
 I don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be
 even GOOD HOUSEKEEPING I don't 
 Oh they are 
 My sister uh takes uh TOWN AND COUNTRY and VOGUE
 and she sends them to me 
 and there's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes very expensive jewelry things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing 
 you know and if I want to drool or if I want to see how the other half is living you know then I look through them
 and I do 
 I just 
 what I do is I flip through them and pitch them then you know 
 they're not something I you know take any length of time over
 I have discovered that you know with my available time I would rather actually read a book than a magazine
 Yes
 and uh 
 So but 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 yes 
 I will read them in a doctor's office too
 As I said I subscribe uh to PEOPLE and to TIME 
 uh and I will go through the TIME but usually not cover to cover you know 
 I'll glance through it 
 I like reading uh you know the PASSAGE OF PEOPLE or something you know 
 uh but I do like the PEOPLE magazine 
 it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when I was young
 and uh that's one you know I really like that 
 I enjoy that 
 It's quick reading you know 
 it doesn't require a lot of thinking 
 and sometimes after I've worked all day and have things to do at night I just I want fluff 
 I don't want a lot of thinking 
 uh you know it's much more relaxing 
 Sometimes when I read TIME magazine after I've read an article I'm real depressed over the situation of the world 
 so Well it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines
 and uh 
 so uh I think that probably I will end the call 
 I've enjoyed
