 Where do you live
 Uh-huh 
 Well I used to 
 I lived there for a long time 
 But I'm now in Palo Alto California which is I think the recycling capital of the world
 So we have many recycling activities 
 and I'm in full uh support of all of them
 Uh-huh
 Well that's something 
 but it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better um cooperation out here uh by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra uh 
 actually I don't think we pay very much extra at all too 
 but the uh garbage men come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb
 Yeah 
 we have burlap sacks
 and they give us one for aluminum and uh steel one for metals and one for glass 
 and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags 
 So we leave three little piles that they need out on the curb every Thursday 
 and the garbage men come by and uh collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape
 And it really pays for itself because oh then the city gets the money from the recycling
 Yeah 
 the one thing I wish we could recycle is magazines 
 But they claim that because of the way they're bound they uh it's too expensive to recycle them 
 At my office we have two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail 
 and they're uh 
 one's for white paper 
 and one's for colored paper 
 so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or so- things like that goes in those boxes 
 but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines 
 and there's no way to get rid of them 
 It just seems like such a waste
 Uh-huh
 Well that would be a help 
 I wish they would do that here 
 We have got so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade
 And it's really going to be a mess when they have to start hunting for places to put the things
 We did have uh another novel uh experiment start this year 
 Now we can put all our yard clippings out
 you buy these super giant heavy-duty paper bags 
 they're about four-feet high
 And you get them for I think it's about fifty cents apiece at the grocery store you um usually buy them by the dozen
 And then you put all your yard clippings and uh leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible 
 and the garbage men also pick those up on Thursdays
 And then uh they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing 
 and at the end of every year uh they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flower beds 
 Yeah
 If they make it so that it's not a horrendous inconvenience I think most people would
 Right
 No 
 I think it's to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up then to get that two cents when you take it to the store
 We still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans for cash 
 But so few people uh have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there then you get back
 Now do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well we can get a nickel apiece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused
 They just take it off like they do a coupon 
 They can just subtract it from your bill
 and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags
 and they say as long as it's clean they don't want a plastic bag that's full of goop 
 Here they don't want your rotted tomatoes
 But they want any clean and dry plastic bag 
 so I keep 
 and the thing is I hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving it to recycle 
 so right outside the back door I've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles
 and there right outside that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers
 and now we've got the bag for the plastic bags 
 Oh yeah
 Well how nice 
 that's great
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well that's 
 they just put all our Christmas trees in the regular uh compost pickup 
 so they did say that you had to put it out within I think it was uh three weeks after Christmas
 And uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse 
 It would have to be cut into four-foot lengths
 So you know if we have branches or something they have to be cut in four-foot lengths 
 but otherwise uh they have to be in one of their paper bags
 And they even picked up our uh Styrofoam packing materials 
 uh the week after Christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying we're trying something new next week only if you have any uh of those little uh Styrofoam peanuts that any of your Christmas presents were packed in put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling 
 and we'll uh take all of those back and try to recycle them
 But I 
 that's not going to be a regular feature 
 That was just a one time thing right after Christmas
 Well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills
 They don't mash 
 They don't compress at all 
 And they stay forever
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I do too 
 The difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile 
 they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff
 Uh because otherwise uh you know they're not going to go house-to-house collecting it 
 and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts 
 Yeah
 Now we quit that about three years ago when we got china mugs for everybody
 and the only difficulty with that is that we're in the middle of a five-year drought 
 and so it's a real difficult choice whether we want Styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or uh china cups to use up our water 
 But at the moment we're using the china cups
 and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year 
 and then uh your supposed to keep it recycled every day
 <> Yeah
 Well let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things 
 because 
 Yep
 It sure will
 Well good to talk
