 Yes
 Have you recently bought a new car Catherine
 Oh
 Oh wow
 Well the last car we got was a used car 
 I really don't prefer buying a new car 
 I like to let somebody else pay for that 
 But uh mine was a year old
 and we bought it for very functional purposes
 and we bought a station wagon 
 We wanted an economical car to operate 
 but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment 
 So we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon
 And I've never been sorry
 however the need for that kind of car has changed now
 and uh while it is still good and it's quite serviceable and I'll drive it until it no longer is reliable
 And probably then some 
 I'll spend a lot of time praying over it before I give it up
 I think that I would like to 
 you know we all say if I could have the car I always wanted I would either buy a Nissan Maxima uh 
 I'm sold on Nissans
 or foreign cars actually 
 Uh
 Uh
 its reliability
 Its reliability 
 And uh you know I've read all the CONSUMER REPORTS and things 
 and they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars 
 If Ford was a head and the shoulders above it I'd buy a Ford
 But I uh had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it
 Uh you know I mean it was ready for the graveyard
 And I spent as much on that car in twelve months as I spent for the car
 So 
 and that was just trying to hold us 
 getting out of that was a used car
 And it was an older car
 but you know Escort is supposed to have a great track record as far as sales
 But it just was not deliv- 
 and you get stung a time or two
 and you say no thanks
 So I just trusted the CONSUMER REPORTS and the auto uh reports inst- 
 had my son who knows a lot about that study them thoroughly 
 and he gave me four choices of cars to buy 
 An Escort definitely was not among them 
 In fact there wasn't an American car in there
 Uh the Nissan came 
 and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes not what the CONSUMER REPORTS said we should get
 But it served our needs 
 Uh later on the reports that he studied showed that uh Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the class that we were looking for 
 and I'd rather have a Maxima than a Cadillac 
 I really would 
 It's not necessarily prestige
 but it's comfort 
 Uh there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car 
 Uh
 Nissan 
 M- 
 No 
 No 
 no 
 Nissan is Japanese
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 And uh if I couldn't have my luxury Maxima then I'd buy me a fancy little red C R X sports car 
 you know every one of us have two sides 
 Yeah 
 Now what about you 
 if you could have the car that you wanted what would you get 
 and why
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 See there 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I tell you that's sad too because there one time Ford was the best that was made
 Really was
 And uh I really have not seen 
 now a lot of the American cars parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa
 Of course
 Okay 
 Uh at any rate do you have color preferences 
 or what would be the features that you would be looking for
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Oh wow 
 We like the stuff that glitters 
 Good
 There's nothing wrong with that 
 Actually I think probably if I were going to be practical which doesn't mean I would be I would prefer white simply because it's more visible at night
 And 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Now the interior 
 okay 
 I don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red
 But if I had the little red C R X I guess the interior would have to be black leather 
 and I'd have to live with that
 And if I got the C R X it would have to have a real good sound system in it because I'd want that too
 I'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's okay
 No 
 no 
 no 
 uh well I listen to K C B I a lot 
 but I will listen to the news and the traffic and those things at work
 But if I'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time I want some real good classical music
 I love classical music 
 and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the characteristics of the instruments
 So I do love classical music [ [ 
 or it li- + or ] + or ] uh contemporary classical
 Uh-huh
 Sure do
 W R R and the Oasis are the two that I listen to more than anything else
 And I do like them 
 And I'd like to have a compact disc player in the car 
 That would be something that I would really like 
 Those compact discs really are good for cars because they don't melt 
 they don't warp
 You know there's nothing in there that can wrap around the uh rollers or anything 
 It seems like a really good answer to portable music that you can choose
