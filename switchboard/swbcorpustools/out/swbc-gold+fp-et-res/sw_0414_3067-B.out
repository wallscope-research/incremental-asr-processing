 Okay uh
 Uh yeah 
 uh our 
 the 
 my mother's side of the family well was quite large at one time 
 and uh they uh for as long as I can remember have had uh a yearly reunion um 
 back uh early on they used to rotate them to different people's houses in the family 
 And 
 Uh no 
 this was well I am actually from Mississippi 
 {C and so that's 
 it was around there generally
 Uh that's where the family grew 
 Yeah 
 and it was not only in Mississippi in some other places as well 
 so uh it was a big deal 
 but uh they tried to centralize it in one spot 
 So in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year
 We rent a pavilion and do that 
 and that's usually works out to be pretty good 
 And uh they will rent a pavilion on a weekend 
 and uh 
 I have not gone back lately 
 In fact uh this past Sunday was the reunion 
 but I did not get to go 
 Uh I have 
 Not getting to go
 Uh just uh the distance involved 
 and 
 uh just not 
 I have a younger daughter now 
 and uh I 
 it's kind of hard to get her there and everything 
 But I am going to uh hopefully next year get to go back cause uh a lot of the family uh on my mother's side has not seen you know my daughter 
 so 
 I have one brother 
 so 
 Yes
 Right 
 yeah
 Right I usually see her a couple times a year 
 so that's no big thing 
 But uh I do enjoy the reunions 
 The only problem is that now uh originally when we had them uh they were mainly my mother's 
 uh father's 
 My mother's father's family had quite a few uh brothers and sisters 
 So it was a large reunion of that group uh from that descendants
 And uh a lot of those people have 
 and at time you know they all knew one another
 And now it has gotten uh that uh a lot of those people uh have died off 
 or you know what we are left with is the relatives of that group 
 And so uh it's not quite as close as it used to be 
 So I think people feel less of a desire to really go 
 I know that 
 Well I just think uh you know at that ti- 
 when they were a- 
 you know those were all brothers and sisters a lot 
 or they were all in the same geographical location
 You know back around you know in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up uh you know they were all located together in one small community
 And when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth 
 And now when they come together it's generally you know 
 like say the kids of those people who are not you know anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there Which is a shame 
 but that's just how it is 
 My mother was complaining last year about th- you know 
 it's dwindling down every year 
 you know I think that's just 
 Well yeah
 Yeah 
 that's uh 
 yeah 
 I think that's some of it 
 But you know I have 
 uh I 
 it's just the way you know I think society is now is that we do not have the extensive family we used to
 It's more of you know a smaller unit 
 and you know we tend to try to do things I think with our immediate family as opposed to the extended family Of people that we may or may not remember or know you know very well 
 Uh 
 Right
 it requires a lot of effort to do that sort of thing 
 I used to enjoy going 
 I still do kind of enjoy it 
 but uh it's not as many people there that I really enjoy seeing
 You know I 
 it's going just for the sake of getting together 
 I think for the family 
 And 
 Uh
 Um um no 
 not really 
 in that 
 but then again uh well you know I have some aunts that uh I do 
 That's about th- 
 my mother's sisters you know 
 but I feel closer to them because I kind of grew up with them 
 But uh as you know for the rest of that group no not really 
 Uh you know and generally when I was growing up a lot of those people the only time I ever saw them was at the reunion 
 so uh 
 you do not really feel that really close to them
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's a good idea
 Right
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
