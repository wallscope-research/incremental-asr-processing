 Oh um uh I usually don't get to hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news
 Uh you know being uh 
 by the time you get off work go by and pick up the uh baby from the baby sitter it's you know after six 
 and by the time everything is settled in 
 it's ten o'clock before I can catch up on anything
 Uh-huh 
 oh yeah
 Oh uh-huh 
 Oh I don't even have time to read the newspaper except in passing 
 you know I'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on
 But uh 
 Yeah 
 We have uh a news thing on the computer uh that I'll try to look at every day
 And uh it's pretty much headline news
 Which isn't you know pretty much what we look for anyway
 But uh do you think that the quality of you know the news events that you get are 
 what do you think about it
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Well you know there's a lot of competition in the media
 And sometimes I think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines And that they'll run a topic into the ground
 And uh You know they try to play public's opinion Which I think is awful because it usually works
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 That 
 uh lots of new uh newsmen were created during that 
 so it will be interesting to see what happens
 Right 
 Uh uh
 Yeah 
 I hate to see that 
 but you know if what it's going to take 
 well you know we can deduct that from our federal income tax 
 uh you know but we need good schools 
 Uh we're more involved in that now 
 And I think it's better for everybody if we had better schools
 So 
 No 
 You know I wish they could have gotten a lottery
 Yeah 
 I think you know the lottery could have helped with that 
 it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax 
 probably would have paid the same amount 
 but you know it's not the idea of your paying uh income tax
 So 
 No 
 It'll be interesting to see what happens
 you know I haven't seen the news in a couple of days 
 So it uh 
 I'm a little behind on things
 Yes 
 that's sad
 Yeah 
 uh yeah they had to choose between the better of the two bad situations 
 and uh I don't know what I've would have done in the situation
 Yeah 
 Right 
 But I understand why Bush you know doesn't want to go in and uh take sides 
 because that would definitely look like another Korea
 and he'd have all these people jumping down his back even though I'd agree with it 
 I think he should've gone in there and blew them away
 Yeah it did a lot 
 He did a real good job I believe 
 I have uh in-laws that live in Saudi Arabia that stayed there during all of it too
 uh it uh you know 
 so we kept very much abreast of what was going on
 Yeah 
 they were the near uh Dahran on the east coast
 They were just north of it Probably about a hundred fifty miles hundred miles from uh the Kuwaiti border 
 Uh and they stayed active was uh the military there Taking supplies out to them in the desert
 it was a new situation
 I don't really have much more to say 
 You're right 
 and that's awful in Texas 
 We got some awful rain uh the other morning 
 And today's just been real drizzly
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 It did
 Oh well we've just got slight chances of rain 
 But uh we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning 
 Course while everybody was getting ready to go to work Making nice traffic jams 
 So <> 
 Oh <> 
 Right 
 uh when was it last week we had all the rain 
 But uh 
 I think we had about eight inches
 It was between six and eight inches here where we are
 And uh you walk out on the ground 
 you 
 it's awful 
 It's just so soggy
 Yeah 
 Well today the air was just so sticky so damp
 Goodness 
 Right 
 Well it's
 Right 
 Well it was nice talking to you
 All right 
 Bye-bye
