 Hi Nancy 
 Well do you do a lot of dining out
 Uh-huh 
 Well we do some dining out 
 Um I do a lot of cooking 
 so um mostly like when we go out you know it's my husband and I 
 we don't go out too often as a family um unless it's like a fast-food kind of thing 
 um but we do enjoy dining out 
 One of our favorite places here in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe 
 I don't know if you have you ever been there
 Um well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific and uh 
 Have you 
 now that's down in uh Highland Park
 It's Highland Park Village 
 Did you like it
 Oh I love it 
 Uh-huh
 Oh it's fabulous 
 It really is a great place 
 Atlantic Cafe is down I believe it's on McKinney
 Um and originally the two the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe were partners in the Atlantic Cafe 
 And then they separated 
 and the guy started Cafe Pacific 
 And I loved them both 
 I really do 
 I think they're wonderful 
 That's our favorite 
 You know what we'd really like if we just have a casual evening is Houston's 
 Have you been there
 It's wonderful 
 The only thing is you have to wait 
 you have to expect to wait at least an hour
 So you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in
 And as long as you know that it's okay 
 But they have I think just about the best prime rib um anywhere in the area 
 I love it
 And my husband really likes their ribs 
 So it's hysterical 
 We go in 
 and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in 
 and then we get there 
 and we don't even look at the menu 
 I know right away what we want 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Was it 
 Really 
 I've been there for like you know lunch
 but I've never been there for dinner 
 And it was good 
 yeah
 Oh that's great 
 That's great 
 Another nice place for prime rib is Baby Doe's
 Maxwell's nice 
 have you been there
 And I didn't think we ate out very often 
 See 
 Baby Doe's is nice
 And one place I'd never been that I would really like to go to uh is Lawry's 
 I've heard that's real good Lawry's Prime Rib
 I've never been there 
 but I've heard it's real good
 Yes 
 Yes 
 actually they have one in Richardson that I've been to
 Uh they have real nice lunches 
 have you been there for lunch 
 Or 
 Yeah
 Really 
 Really
 Uh-huh 
 The specials
 Have you ever been to Biffin's
 I keep hearing about it 
 I keep hearing the advertisements of it
 and they keep saying you know oh it's wonderful it's wonderful 
 I have not been over there 
 and I was thinking you know it's supposed to be a family place over near Plano Super Bowl
 And uh I've not been there
 I've been there
 That was nice 
 Oh 
 I've heard of it 
 where it's made 
 it's like a 
 it's all chocolate like made like a paper bag
 and it's filled with what whip cream and strawberries and something 
 Yeah
 Oh
 Oh
 Oh
 Oh I bet it was 
 I bet it was
 The last time we went to Cafe Pacific it was Father's Day 
 and we took another friend with us 
 and uh for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves 
 And so they had uh like a berry assortment 
 it was raspberries and blueberries and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom
 And you know they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a decoration on the 
 you know how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it 
 and it was outstanding 
 It was really relatively simple 
 but oh it was good 
 It was really good
 You can't find them 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 You know I'm originally from Connecticut 
 and uh I was home a few years ago 
 and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner 
 and uh I was really amazed you know 
 the restaurants up there were kind of quaint 
 You know they were real real pretty 
 but they lacked the service 
 and they lacked just the I don't know 
 The restaurants down here seem like they have uh 
 I guess there's so much competition that they really have to be good
 And I thought I would really miss that
 Uh-huh
 And you know in order to survive in this area I think they have to be good
 Because the ones that aren't so good just don't make it
 Oh really
