 Okay 
 I guess tonight's subject is uh woodworking
 Do you uh 
 Well kind of mainly the woodworking I've done lately is uh made like uh for example a little nativity scene Uh not uh the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable put some shelves in and some odd stuff around the house 
 and so I enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking 
 and I do it out of hobby more than uh you know something I have to do 
 How about yourself
 Uh-huh
 Well I'll have to come and see them 
 That sounds like a good idea 
 I you know 
 and that is right 
 it is out of necessity 
 because lot of the things uh well we can't be able to afford 
 but also I sometimes think that uh I enjoy doing that 
 and I like to get out and uh to work with my hands 
 and uh sounds like you got some real nice tools too 
 Do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh a entertainment type center
 Oh
 Right
 Right 
 right
 Right 
 yes 
 I 
 yeah 
 I'm aware of that
 And also with a router you can uh make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge Uh And uh casings and so forth that are real nice 
 so that's good 
 That's good
 Yeah 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldn't be able to do that 
 Uh but uh yeah 
 a table saw does take a lot of space and is a pretty big investment
 And 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 No 
 they don't have basements 
 Well I'm from up north also 
 and uh no 
 there's no basements down here 
 and it's kind of uh hard to get uh shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that 
 Yeah 
 lot of the equipment too that I've used in the past uh you know I've used in school 
 and uh I would 
 I don't know 
 I'd kind of like to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say a table saw and some of those things that would make uh some pretty nice uh pieces of uh well wood for different things for tables for uh chairs for you know decks and so forth 
 so I don't know 
 I just enjoy woodworking 
 and I think the main thing is like you say it's a good out 
 It's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day 
 and it's a great stress reliever
 Yes 
 in school I have 
 and I've made uh uh different things uh uh tables for chairs 
 and I've made uh bowls 
 uh and uh
