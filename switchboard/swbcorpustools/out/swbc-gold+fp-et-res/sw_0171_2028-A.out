 Okay um 
 How has it been this week for you
 Weather-wise
 Oh no 
 damp
 Uh-huh
 My goodness 
 Well I don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then
 It was ninety-six yesterday
 and we set a record yesterday uh very windy 
 but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature very cool uh 
 I think right now it's like sixty-nine
 and that's cool for u- 
 or it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant 
 no rain in the last month I don't think 
 The ground's very dry 
 and our yard work everything is in bloom 
 so our yard work is pretty tough the ground being dry 
 but I guess it also uh brings about allergies 
 we're having a lot of allergies down here right now
 Everything blooming 
 and the weather 
 And uh I think a lot of people have contracted uh spring fever too 
 so Had a lot of people out at work you know for fishing uh and golfing reasons and things like that
 Yeah
 Yes
 Um
 Um
 Uh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 No snow
 Um
 Um
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 yes 
 it is 
 Down in the more southern and western areas 
 And of course we are um about two hours from the northern border straight south
 and uh very windy 
 It's amazing to me 
 because I have only lived in Dallas for three years 
 and I cannot believe that the wind blows all the time
 It does 
 I 
 very seldom if any 
 I can't remember you know a day that I walked out and the wind wasn't blowing
 Um
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh where did you go to school in Indiana
 Purdue 
 I have a brother that lives in uh uh South Bend Indiana
 And I had to always 
 I've lived there for eight years myself 
 I'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame
 But I didn't Uh
 No 
 originally I'm from New Mexico
 I was born in New Mexico 
 and we lived in uh South Bend for eight years and uh then moved to uh Tennessee actually
 And uh 
 Very much 
 very much 
 cause I spent thirteen years there And uh then moved to Dallas about three years ago 
 So 
 Yeah uh 
 my father was in the Air Force 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 um it's just as long as you want to
 it's just uh as long as you want to just you know a reasonable lengthy conversation 
 Uh do you work for Texas Instruments
 Oh okay
 Uh-huh
 Oh okay
 Yeah
 Well actually I work for Texas Instruments 
 and uh I'm an environmental engineer
 and uh they just published this internally you know getting people involved
 So that's really strange 
 I was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though 
 I was saying God do we have a TI in Maryland 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh well 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Well really uh the letter just says um 
 let's see I can't 
 I was looking at it 
 I was trying to find out speedy short cuts 
 and I always thought it's not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and end it when needed 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Uh well it's actually um waste water
 taking care of uh 
 I'm actually in the air division 
 and we monitor um anything that comes out of a stack or out of a building 
 or um we do have customers that um their concerns are in the work place 
 and we take care of that 
 but within our department We take care of everything Waste water uh solid waste and recycling and air and 
 Oh uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 actually our division is corporate wide 
 and we take care of just the Dallas area
 Of course we have several plants here 
 but um we do air modeling also
 and yeah I take care of all the air modeling specifically for the Dallas area 
 What we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information you know temperature wind speed wind direction 
 and uh we have a huge chemical data base
 And uh our chemical data base so that we know every chemical on site
 and um it's concentration 
 and if anything ever happened God forbid you know a building explosion or something we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station
