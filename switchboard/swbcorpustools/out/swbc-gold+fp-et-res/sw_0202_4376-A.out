 Your turn
 But not for petty theft
 Well it should be used as a deterrent do you think
 Or should it be used uh 
 to prevent further uh crime Huh
 Uh-huh
 Well you know there's this old uh Jewish is it saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
 Well one of the things I was thinking about is uh you know from society's point of view if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize the end game value 
 So if you have someone that destroys that value uh then you want to take steps to uh minimize the loss 
 Of course you have to also put value on the criminal
 So if you terminate him that's a loss of value
 So you know if you weight everyone equally then you have to say well the likelihood of not terminating him 
 if you don't terminate him the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person 
 In other words you'd have to murder more than one other person uh in order to justify taking his life
 Another way you could do it is weight this value by uh the value to society of the people Uh which is pretty delicate thing to do 
 But one way of doing it is uh by income 
 So if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money which is often times the case then he's obviously not worth very much 
 and so uh the likelihood that you know maybe expected murders by him is uh integrated over the income of the people uh that he murders is maybe you know a loss of who knows eight hundred thousand dollars 
 Uh but if he only uh you know integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is uh small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him 
 Of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's easier uh to uh terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less Which means well 
 I suppose you could say well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation
 Uh-huh 
 Now that's all fine and well and uh good philosophical 
 But if you're involved yourself personally 
 uh I know I have a friend whose uh son was murdered uh on the night before his sixteenth birthday 
 And let me tell you uh I knew them personally uh not intimately but quite well 
 and uh you're talking about real trauma trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies
 The father you know 
 of course a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get I think in terms of psychological impact
 Uh and 
 Oh yes 
 They found him 
 and he is on trial for capital murder
 Uh well actually He was convicted uh 
 and of course now you know you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process 
 but
