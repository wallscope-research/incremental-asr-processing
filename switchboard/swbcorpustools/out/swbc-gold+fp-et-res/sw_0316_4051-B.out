 Yeah 
 I might as well 
 Uh one of the things I'm very concerned about the air pollution is the ozone layer uh uh issue 
 Uh I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of different types of freons 
 and that uh rather bothers me that uh I was in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the environment so to speak
 Right 
 right 
 and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in that area was because they were inexpensive 
 uh they could be made uh you know inexpensive and lots of it uh 
 and in that its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work
 So 
 Well course there's a tremendous number of refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve 
 and of course the new cars I guess starting with nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems 
 But uh there's you know the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera
 And that's got me very you know highly concerned that uh that's going to be quite a while before we can uh undo this 
 Now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession 
 but you got to have people that can you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion 
 so I see us in somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless the banks or industry and the government go together and come up with a way to uh have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting uh compound
 Because as I say there's a tremen- 
 well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator 
 and then do you know that number how many a freezer separate from and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning
 there are people that have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on automobiles and trucks 
 and uh the only reason I didn't uh get into that more when I had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree
 and 
 so uh that's why I stayed more towards uh uh 
 and that's a polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with water uh <> really uh make a mess
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well most of the time when you see uh you know the busses with the diesel uh those are carbon particles and carbon dioxide and water vapor uh 
 because when diesel is burned it's it 
 you know diesel fuel is burned in the diesel engine 
 it's burned so completely that you don't have any uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil uh is not very volatile You know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone
 Diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily 
 and it's got 
 well you know it's latent heat is high 
 but it's slow burning at uh normal pressures 
 That's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio
 and so if the car sucks in uh fifty degrees
