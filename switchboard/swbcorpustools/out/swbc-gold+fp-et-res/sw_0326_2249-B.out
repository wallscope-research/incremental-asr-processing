 Uh in the Houston area
 Oh that's great
 Oh we are too 
 Our community is uh just starting to get organized about it 
 They just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our things and dump them off ourselves
 And uh it 
 Uh-huh
 I think that's great 
 There's a few places in Houston where they're trying that out 
 I don't know if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded uh bags and uh bins
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's great
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 we're all for it 
 Our um 
 we've got several bins in our garage where we uh you know sort things out and take it to the appropriate places
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Oh it does 
 It does 
 But I'm sure that they can uh find some sort of uh use for them if you know you know there 
 I've seen talk about uh using garbage for uh energy
 And so you know you could also apply the magazines toward that
 Yes
 Oh I know it
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh
 Oh that's great
 Right 
 well that's a great idea 
 I wish we were that uh involved in uh or that our city was that involved in recycling like that 
 because you know I've talked to many people 
 and we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it Uh
 Yeah 
 oh yeah You know 
 and I don't mind you know 
 at first it was the little extra money that you got you know returning the cans in and stuff like that
 But now you know I don't mind as long as things are getting recycled you know that we don't get reimbursed
 Uh-huh
 Oh oh I know it
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yes 
 plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also
 We have 
 I know the one that we use uh has uh recycling for the bags
 uh and they're promoting the cloth bags You know the reusable cloth bags
 Oh that's great
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 I understand uh 
 my husband about once a weekend he'll go uh to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out
 And he'll go pick them up because he just can't stand that 
 he 
 And uh it's so you know 
 we have all our piles of recyclables also
 I remember at Christmas the only thing that I'm 
 when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did that was they uh provided a place for us to take our Christmas trees Uh for them to mulch for city use
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well that sounds like you all really have a great system worked out there
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Well see that's one 
 Well the 
 but uh something does need to be done about the Styrofoam that uh 
 Oh yeah 
 they don't uh uh 
 No
 Right 
 And I've seen where some places have taken a plastic and uh they're recycling them into other plastics And the Styrofoam also into insulation and things like that 
 and I think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Oh I was thinking about you know like uh the Styrofoam used at uh the fast-food restaurants that if everybody uh 
 and so 
 yeah 
 I know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of Styrofoam 
 but uh 
 Huh
 Well that's good 
 That's a 
 they should last awhile 
 I believe we are 
 I have to believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening
 And so it will be good in the long run 
 Well I enjoyed it
