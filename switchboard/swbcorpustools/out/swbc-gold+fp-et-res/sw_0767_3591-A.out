 Well 
 Well yes 
 I do 
 Uh this is a question that hit pretty close to home 
 I had to go through this with my dad about four years ago 
 his health was failing
 and uh he was adamant about two things 
 One was that I take care of my mother 
 and two that he not be put into a home
 And we talked uh about some length 
 and I respected his wishes 
 He uh stayed at home as long as he could 
 and then uh he died in a hospital 
 But um I think that my position is that uh you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care [ of the uh of their ] clients
 and um because I've heard about the many abuses and because he had heard of so many abuses he just didn't want that
 How about you
 Yeah 
 all over thirty percent isn't it
 Uh-huh
 They're captive
 Uh at one stage we had care somewhat like what you're talking about 
 We had the Visiting Nurses program
 and they sent somebody in 
 and it was a nominal charge that uh it started out that the lady would come in I think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day
 They would try to get him to exercise 
 They would try to uh you know 
 they would check him over to you know the basic checks 
 Try to get him to talk and be motivated
 and uh that's what we went through 
 Uh up to a point things seemed to be working 
 and then uh I think he became discouraged
 and they did not know how to take care of that 
 and then um at that point I think it's mostly a psychological problem
 And uh but yes 
 I agree there's a lot of options 
 There could be a lot of options
 I think it's time that uh we decide to do something about it
 Um
 I suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need
 Yeah 
 the church or synagogue whatever because typically these were close knit groups at one time 
 but in today's large metropolitan areas or even the rural areas now people are not quite as close as they once were
 Uh the mobility factor the factor that uh oh we're living longer and people are less trusting all these things tend to destroy this type of system 
 But I agree with you 
 there might be some possibilities there
 Although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do
 I think they would have to have some training
