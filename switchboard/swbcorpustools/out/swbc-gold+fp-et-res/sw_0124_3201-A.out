 So do you have any recycling programs there
 Uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh
 Yeah
 We've progressed a little bit farther than that
 Um actually they have uh 
 parts of town 
 it may have even spread all over the whole town 
 and um they will have these green bins
 and it's just as standard as a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump
 And uh just along with a trash can you have this green plastic bin 
 and you put your bottles in it and paper and uh you know all those things 
 aluminum 
 You know anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin
 And uh I guess you can al- 
 and a lot of the restaurants they just have uh places especially beer places where you can throw away green bottles and then the brown bottles 
 And uh oh I don't know 
 I guess they're you know clear bottles
 So um you know a lot of people do have those separated 
 And of course they have the um dumpsters uh the igloos
 Uh and they have those strategically placed around the city
 And uh they're actually going to extend it I think one of these days maybe to apartment complexes 
 and uh 
 Yeah 
 things of that nature 
 So I guess when you live in a bigger city it really becomes uh necessary
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh really
 Huh
 Yeah 
 I remember my grandparents and I used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans
 And uh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 they're doing a real good job of uh separating it here 
 And of course there you know you have a specific place to put your paper
 And uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it 
 but they actually have the door to door pickup 
 Um and uh I think it started out to be um just kind of a test a pilot project
 And it went over so well that they just extended it 
 And it's almost uh 
 I don't know if it's done by a private company or not 
 It may be 
 But uh they just go around to each uh door and pick it up
 Yeah
 Let's see 
 Oh and every year of course the phone books um they tell everybody across the city to uh put all their phone books in uh the uh recycle bins
 Because you know phone books are pretty 
 well for a bigger city they're pretty thick
 And sometimes you might have two or three
 So uh that's a big savings right there in itself
 Yeah
 huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well the thing about newspapers and paper 
 recycled paper is actually very expensive
 So when you see something that's on recycled paper they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that 
 It's uh 
 they're not coming out ahead at all 
 uh it's really a cost
 Yeah
 it sounds good to the public 
 but there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something 
 Now aluminum I don't know 
 They may be coming out ahead 
 But I know for a fact that the paper uh on that end they're not you know 
 It's just good to recycle 
 but it's uh not to their advantage
 And it costs less
 I can't think of anything else
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Well I hope you all um uh come along a little farther in the future
 It was nice talking to you
 Bye-bye
