 Well as a matter of fact I just bought one 
 just within the last three weeks
 I got a Lexus L S four hundred Which is made by Toyota
 Yeah
 It's kind of their 
 Right 
 it sounds like it but it really isn't 
 It's uh marketed of course its own dealerships
 Usually or somebody that's maybe got a Cadillac or Lincoln and Lexus dealership uh
 sometimes they do that 
 but it's uh a brand car 
 but I've really liked it 
 it drives just wonderfully 
 and there is 
 it's so quiet almost can't tell the engine is running
 It really is 
 It's got pretty good acceleration too
 It's got a C D player in it 
 so I can play those 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 But there is not very many options on that car
 There is only about five or six options 
 Everything else is standard
 Uh some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north The C D and the premium sound system
 Yeah 
 it's kind of a traction control I think they call it
 it's not just antilock brake 
 I think that's already on most of them 
 but there is a further traction control uh
 Yeah
 and also the suspension can be raised for driving like in the ice and snow 
 It can raise the car's center up a little bit For going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in Michigan or somewhere
 Mississippi probably doesn't have to worry too much 
 If it does people go what's this stuff
 Oh 
 well you had some there 
 Yeah
 Oh I know
 Oh no
 Well uh the Lexus uh really 
 and the moon roof I think is also an option
 Although most of them are ordered them with it 
 but there really is only about a half a dozen uh things 
 and everything else is pretty standard 
 I did not get the traction control which also when you take the traction control and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats too
 You go out and get in that real cold car
 and you turn that on 
 yeah and it kind of uh 
 but that's only available with the traction control and the other option
 And those two are sold together 
 so you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to uh do it 
 so I opted not for that 
 And uh the dealership I dealt with they order them all with the uh moon roof and uh you know nice floor mats and everything in there
 So the only thing I had to decide on was whether I wanted a C D or not in the stereo system 
 and that was pretty much it 
 And they had like three or four basic packages that they offer
 Yeah 
 I've been o- 
 I've been 
 Yeah 
 I've seen that in the dealership 
 I was driving a Lincoln a Mark Seven for the last four years before I traded it for this 
 and uh I'm leasing the Lexus 
 I usually lease them since I own a business 
 I just run it through my business 
 but it 
 the Lincoln ride is certainly good too but this Lexus is nothing like I have ever been in before 
 *[[one or two utt]] It's just 
 Yeah 
 it really is 
 and it's got a lumbar support in the seats
 Adjustable uh power 
 and just kind of brings that support up in the sma-
