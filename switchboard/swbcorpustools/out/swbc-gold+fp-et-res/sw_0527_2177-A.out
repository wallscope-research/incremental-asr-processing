 Cindy have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES
 Oh that is a wonderful movie
 No
 Oh goodness no
 you don't even realize it you know
 Really
 Oh I thought it was great 
 Yeah
 Well yeah 
 and I heard a story about there's a certain scene in the movie um where they're on a buffalo hunt
 And they have a particular child actor uh who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo
 And when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young's buffalo
 I can't remember what they said his name was 
 But he has a fetish for Oreo cookies
 And he got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with oreo cookies 
 I thought that was really funny
 Oh yeah
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 the wagon driver
 Yeah
 And uh the costuming *[[slash error]] yeah was 
 *[[slash error]] the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that um the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things
 And they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably to age the material 
 so they did very authentic reproductions of the actual stuff 
 but they didn't age it quite enough it seemed
 But it was a very good movie
 What have you seen lately
 Oh I didn't see that
 I don't like Stephen King
 Really
 I wasn't sure 
 because uh just generally you know that kind of scary stuff I just don't want to have anything to do with it
 Yeah 
 I think I heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something you know
 Um
 Ugh
 Yeah
 It still just seems a little twisted to me 
 I'm not sure I would have enjoyed that at all
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 I know 
 we don't see movies at the movies a lot
 The last 
 we did go see DANCES WITH WOLVES 
 and we went to see NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER 
 but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape 
 and then we rent them 
 Oh yeah 
 that looks really good too
 And SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
 I'm intrigued by it 
 but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet 
 I think uh 
 well now we had some friends that went to see it 
 and they said it was okay
 So it might not be as 
 I think they may be playing up um some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects
 Now we went to see the JAGGED EDGE
 Yeah
 So it seems like you know that kind of thriller suspense and not real um strange in other ways
 Okay 
 Maybe we'll talk to you again
 Alright
 Bye-bye
