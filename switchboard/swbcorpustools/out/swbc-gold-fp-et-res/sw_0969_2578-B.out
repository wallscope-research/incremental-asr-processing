 Not really 
 I'm not much of a fan of Nancy Reagan 
 so I don't particularly read biographies or autobiographies
 I haven't read too many 
 I'm more of a fiction and nonfiction reader not of that nature though
 Yeah
 if they had it I don't even know that I'd probably read it even if it was at the library though
 you know I'm just not really interested in reading about other people's lives to that degree
 You know unless maybe they lived a long long time ago 
 For me it would be interesting to find out what life was like you know in that period 
 But not really interested 
 Yeah 
 I think the last biography that I read I think it was on Lady Randolph Churchill Churchill's mother 
 And that was excellent
 yeah 
 It was 
 it's in two parts 
 I think the first one is called JENNY or something like that because that was her name 
 And I only got to read one part of it 
 And I've been looking for you know the other half of it and read the 
 I read that half where she was in her later years 
 and it was absolutely excellent 
 And it was very descriptive of people with money back then and affluents in England that you know were associated to the king and all 
 And it was really pretty fascinating 
 and that was actually a couple of years ago 
 so it's been a while since I've read any biographies 
 I love to read 
 I'm constantly reading 
 I like mysteries 
 and I like 
 as far as improving myself I haven't read any lately 
 But I was reading classical works that I hadn't read before You know that you might have needed to read in school but that I just didn't read for some reason or another or you know that you can only read so many in school that they make a requirement of
 And you have so many out there that you know you never get a chance to read 
 And so I said 
 well I think it was because I read Dickens' A TALE OF TWO CITIES
 and that even when I read it now it still makes me cry the ending of it
 And I could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book
 I'd read some Dickens before 
 but I hadn't read that one 
 And I thought to myself you know what other things are out there that are classics you know that have withstood time and that are just excellent 
 something's excellent about them whether it's the way they were written or whether it was the material you know that was written about 
 so I started reading 
 you know I had a binge of bo- 
 my mother 
 I was living in Bermuda at the time with my husband 
 but my mother sent me you know like you know boxes full of different books
 And she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over 
 But she was I guess because 
 it seems like older people have much better 
 in their schooling they got more of the classics than I did you know 
 And she knows so much more of them than I do 
 I wouldn't even know you know to go look for that author or that book
 You know
 probably you read a book review or something
 A review on it
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well what I do is I usually have two books at one time 
 I have a classic which I have to work on basically you know just depending 
 well some authors I can just you know basically drink in
 but others eh I really do have to work at them 
 And then whether you know they're a foreign author or whatever or if it's their style or just understanding the material 
 And then some of those it's like I said 
 it's like school 
 you have to work at it
 But to me it's worthwhile in the end 
 I feel good about it 
 and I usually remember those a long time later 
 And then I have books that I read just purely for enjoyment you know 
 yeah 
 just light reading that are 
 I particularly like Dick Francis books and just some of the authors that are for mysteries you know just purely for entertainment you know 
 That's it 
 I'm not really expecting to get anything out of it except to be momentarily pleased you know because I can never remember the plots or anything later on those books
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 television it gives you everything
 So it's basically mindless 
 the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you you know what you're hearing and your sight 
 But they give you everything else
 And the television that we see nowadays seems like it doesn't even have some of the underlying things to it you know that maybe the old movies and things had you know the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out
 Or you know like with Hitchcock or something where you're either expecting something or w- 
 I don't know 
 I don't really care much for T V at all 
 I just 
 I sometimes get hooked into it 
 but I really get mad at myself when I do because I realize fully there's no really redeeming value for T V 
 No 
 Yeah 
 You're developing your imagination
 You know when you develop your imagination that can take you into a lot of other areas because you've developed your mind in seeing things you know even if it's your own set way you know 
 you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind
 So it's excellent 
 we haven't got children yet 
 but I hope to set an example for ours you know that reading it can be your best friend basically 
 even if you haven't got a human friend around you can pick up a book and be with somebody basically
 It sounds like your kids are doing stuff 
 Or are you a teacher
 I gathered you might be a teacher
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Okay
 Okay 
 You too
 Take care 
 Bye-bye
