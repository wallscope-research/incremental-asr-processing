 I'm sorry 
 hobbies
 Let me see 
 I don't know if that took or not 
 I'll do it again
 Okay 
 What are your hobbies 
 I hear you have kids right
 That's your full time hobby right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I try to do some painting although I'm not very good at it 
 Well no 
 not really
 Yeah 
 you know I inherited the genes that make me think I'm creative but not the ones that give me the ability to be
 So I always try
 I do some sewing mostly out of necessity 
 I'm making drapes for my house just because I'm 
 Yeah 
 well it isn't and it is 
 It is you know 
 actually the sewing isn't the hard part 
 it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room
 Yeah 
 I've been doing that 
 and That 
 yeah 
 that 
 but usually have to do the pleats by hand 
 So that at least I can do you know watching T V or whatever 
 but 
 Yeah 
 and I've gone and you know put the needle through my thumb a few times trying to get it through 
 but 
 Yeah 
 so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything but I need to do it
 let's see I have a dog and a lot of fish 
 Keeping fish I guess is my biggest hobby
 yes and no 
 It depends on how frequently they die and how much that bothers you
 That's 
 you don't have to do as much as I thought 
 In fact my problem 
 I had fish as a kid 
 and they always died immediately 
 and what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean
 because you have 
 Right 
 you need to let the bacteria build up 
 and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance
 And I would just take everything out and just like you know wash it with scalding hot water
 and it would kill all the bacteria 
 and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again
 so 
 Right
 That's right 
 So now I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing
 and I don't try and sterilize things 
 That's right
 That's right
 Well I've had them 
 I guess it's been two years now I've had a tank here 
 and then back at home I used to have a small you know five gallon tank 
 But that never worked well 
 And *[[slash error]] I have fifty-five gallons now
 *[[sd]] It's a lot easier
 No 
 No 
 not yet
 That's right 
 I really do 
 But you know 
 Yeah 
 I just have you know what they call community fish guppies and platies and basic things 
 I don't get into the 
 right 
 right 
 The expensive ones
 They are 
 They're very expensive 
 and you know when they die it's more like an investment
 You lost an investment 
 so 
 No 
 not really 
 Only if there's baby fish
 You always have to isolate those
 You get a 
 well no 
 they have breeders
 It's a little plastic things that sort of floats
 and you put the mother fish in there 
 and then it's got like a trough underneath her
 so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough 
 and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either 
 And that's you know 
 it kind of works 
 but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate
 and on occasion if you get a real small one 
 *[[slash error; one utt with utt2]] it'll fit out the slots
 That's right 
 But you know it works I guess
 they'll eat them
 Yeah
 Yes
 and it's funny because the one I have every single month without fail she has babies
 no 
 All the time 
 and I 
 and she's supposed to 
 her variety it says they won't eat the babies 
 and I've seen her do it 
 So 
 it's ter- 
 well it makes you understand that you know things are different 
 right We might decide what's proper and what isn't 
 but you know that's the way it is for them
 Yeah 
 That's it
 Yes 
 because if the baby is strong enough it can swim away fast enough and go hide
 So 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 No 
 not really
 I try 
 I play a couple of instruments
