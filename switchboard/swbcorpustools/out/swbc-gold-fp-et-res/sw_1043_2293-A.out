 Okay
 Uh-huh
 I don't know 
 there's a lot of air pollution
 I think industries and companies provide a lot of it
 and I guess with the oil burning over in Kuwait and stuff that would have a lot of air pollution in it
 I'm north of Pittsburgh 
 so 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff 
 and I know there's a lot of air pollution going in there 
 and like they get fined whenever they do the air pollution
 but the fine is nothing you know
 it's like nothing to them
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 my God 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 but I don't know what they can do to really prevent it you know 
 Like how 
 what can they do about the oil burning over in Kuwait 
 What you know 
 they fine the industries 
 but you know that doesn't seem to stop them there 
 I don't know what else they can do
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I 
 yeah 
 I just don't understand you know what else anyone can do about it 
 I don't think it's something that people really think about either
 You know it should probably be a big issue you know because it's doing a lot of damage 
 but I 
 it's something you know 
 I don't think many people really think about it because it's nothing they 
 I don't think we really have too much control over it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 exactly
 Well I really don't know too much else about it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we have tried 
 you know and I know you know where a couple of the mills that have 
 I know they put things on their stacks you know to filter the smoke and do all kinds of things 
 but every now and then it breaks you know 
 and you just have smoke going out into the air for a day or two until you can get it fixed
 so you know it's something we have tried to help
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 okay 
 well 
 Uh-huh 
 It's been nice talking to you
 Okay 
 bye-bye
