 in Texas they do have the capital punishment 
 and I'm probably one that has to agree with it too 
 there a- 
 some things that go on that [ I just feel that + I just feel that that is a need 
 I don't know 
 A lot of people don't feel that way either 
 but I just feel that 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that is a consequence 
 yeah
 Right 
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on
 But I just feel that capital punishment needs to stay within the system 
 Not all states have them 
 but I you know [ was that + was that the + I'm not sure if that was in 
 was that the man that claimed he was abused 
 or 
 And that he had 
 he 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 And how long had he been appealing 
 How long was that
 Gosh

 You know it's not used that often you know At least here in Texas 
 but I think it's something that needs to stay 
 I really do <>

 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh

 My sister and I were wondering about this recently because an old friend of ours in California this happened about a week ago
 her husband just killed her

 if something does capital punishment you know does it happen within that 
 I don't know 
 Right
 I think you're right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 And I have an uncle that is an attorney that defends people
