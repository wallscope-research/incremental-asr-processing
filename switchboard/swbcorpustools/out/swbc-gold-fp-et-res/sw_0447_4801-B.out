 Well I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes
 Well I think first degree murder probably warrants it
 Right
 Exactly 
 Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever 
 well I originally come from the state that has the death penalty 
 I come from Florida
 And they're pretty liberal on it 
 They tend to like fry people left and right which 
 go ahead
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 okay 
 I think Florida still uses electric chair
 I don't know 
 In some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing God
 And that's not 
 I don't think that's right 
 But on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it
 I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it 
 and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not 
 with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year 
 They 
 Uh-huh
 Sure 
 And you know that's a big problem 
 but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build
 and it gets to be a big problem
 go ahead 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Because a lot of these guys you know they get in 
 and they get off for good behavior 
 and I don't know 
 up in Minnesota where I am now they don't have the death penalty 
 And you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system you know Because they figure well you know sure I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something 
 but then for 
 if I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten
 sure you know 
 just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails you know there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early
 But if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head 
 I don't know 
 I think that may solve a lot of that
 Maybe not solve it 
 but I don't know 
 maybe 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 What do you do Georgeanne
 okay 
 Great 
 What program you in
 Okay 
 Fantastic 
 I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida
 Yeah 
 I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell
 yeah 
 But I don't know 
 it's an interesting issue 
 like you say in Texas there's been quite a few 
 and in Florida in the last few years I think there's been a lot 
 you know I can't give you figures 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 is that right
 Okay
 Yeah 
 I kind of 
 yeah I've heard things about that 
 I've heard that they don't mess around very much
 <> *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 *[[slash error]] Jeez 
 that's a lot of repeals
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I don't know 
 I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it 
 I guess 
 what's the policy now with treason 
 do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence
 Yeah
 Yeah
