 Well 
 Well I'm thirty-one
 Yeah 
 right 
 you know I've seen a social change 
 yeah
 It's definitely 
 for sure 
 and besides that I came from California where social change is like you know 
 Yeah
 every second
 You know social change in California means it takes another two or three minutes longer to get to work
 And it started you know actually going to work in eighty-two 
 I guess that's when it was 
 Between eighty-two and eighty-five it started out taking me an hour and fifteen minutes to get to work 
 and then it became you know an hour and a half to you know some days two hours to get to work
 That's social change
 
 Yeah 
 that's a tricky one 
 I'll let you go first
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I think that's probably for two reasons 
 you know the number one is women wanted to get out of the house 
 And the second reason is everything costs so much more that if you don't have you know equal rights so that your wife gets equal pay you can't make twice as much 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I've found that too you know where the wife is married and 
 not married 
 sorry 
 wrong word
 Where the wife has gone to school you know and gotten a degree spent five years out in the work force found you know their husband either at college or whatever 
 but still you know after five years it's like first kid
 and then they're out of the work force for another ten years
 But I think most of those people are still out 
 I think that generation they're all at home right now 
 and we won't see them back for another two or three years
 very rarely do I meet anybody whose children are you know past that age when they've been away for a few years
 But it's kind of different
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I 
 I'm an assistant Scout Master 
 and it's like 
 yeah 
 parents even rarely see their kids for weekends which is you know kind of rough too
 Especially now 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I know two women that 
 let's see 
 one of them's forty-nine 
 and well the other one I don't know what her age is 
 but I know she is somewhere in that hairy age of half a century up there
 And boy I'll tell you 
 these are the go-gettingest happiest people I've ever met
 You know because 
 I'm thirty 
 I'm getting gray hairs already
