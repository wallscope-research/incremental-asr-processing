 Well I don't know 
 I think the budget is really out of hand right now 
 and especially in this election year I think that there ought to be at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this
 Right
 Right 
 and well as you said mostly they are token cuts 
 especially what for instance George Bush is offering
 Yeah 
 ninety-seven cents a week 
 Now what 
 that's really not going to do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average middle income person you know 
 Another ninety-seven cents 
 hell you can buy a coke or something for that
 Yeah
 That ninety-seven cents really isn't going to do it for me either
 I haven't really heard much of what the other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either 
 especially the Democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point
 I believe it was Dukakis
 but I can't 
 Yeah 
 that's better than George Bush who came out and said No 
 I will not
 read my lips or whatever *[[slash error]] and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know I I can't follow through on this
 *[[sd^q]] But it seems to me that the budget is so out of hand 
 and especially now that they say Okay the cold war is over 
 and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend you know of X number of billion trillion dollars a year 
 Well I'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go 
 because in my opinion I don't think I'm ever going to see any of this so-called peace dividend 
 if they could actually put something together and make 
 I'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because I feel that they waste money also 
 but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever
 Right 
 Exactly 
 and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country
 Yeah 
 and there's no way that we can ever really recover from the state that we're in right now at least I feel unless we focus on the infra structure 
 and I surely don't hear anybody saying that right now
 So am I
 I U
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington
 Yeah 
 well it's more than a loaded 
 it's a loaded cannon 
 they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year 
 and they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job of spending that money
 no *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 *[[b]] for the moment 
 and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November and you'll elect me again
 and then I'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said
 or you know it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference
 No 
 no 
 not at all
 No
