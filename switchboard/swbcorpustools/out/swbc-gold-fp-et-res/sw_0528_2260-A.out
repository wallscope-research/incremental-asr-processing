 Okay 
 let's see 
 I think 
 I guess if I call I'm supposed to start 
 I think that's the way everybody has done it so far
 But anyway I think that we are paying a lot in taxes 
 but I think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money 
 we're probably one of the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have 
 The you know 
 as far as the quality of the streets the school systems the hospital stuff that the government gives money to the you know all the things that the government does like that I think they need to manage it a little bit better 
 but I don't think anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks because they've been messing it up for many years now 
 So 
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 Right 
 I think it's seven here
 Seven point something
 Huh-uh
 Yeah 
 Right
 Where are you at 
 What state
 really
 Yeah 
 There's 
 we're still one of few that don't have the state tax 
 Yeah 
 That's true
 Yeah 
 I do 
 I've lived in the Dallas area here since I was like four
 So it's I don't know an urban area I guess 
 whatever 
 I don't know
 Yeah
 No 
 No 
 I've just lived here 
 But I don't know 
 I do 
 I can think of all the biblical things about it too 
 what did they say to 
 I can't think of the scripture 
 Render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's
 *[[listen]] So you know even in the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and Jesus said the money in the fishes mouth or in the fisher inside the fish 
 And I thought of those two things when I was holding for a long time
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 sure
 Sure
 Right
 Yeah 
 are 
 No 
 not really 
 I spends a lot of time with our income tax though especially this year and last year 
 I have been married for just a few years 
 so I've had to really switch around from the E Z form to the 
 Right 
 All the deductions and all that
 Yeah 
 It really did
 I saw that too
 Right
 Right
 We're looking at buying a house
 And that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 There's a thing I just 
 I've been trying to learn as much as I can about it 
 if you pay 
 I know I get paid twice a month every two weeks
 that's once a month
 Well I get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in thirteen months 
 So if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks Instead of once a month you'll come out paying one month extra every year
 And if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note
 yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Right
 And that's going on the principle 
 it doesn't pay any interest
 or usually it doesn't
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 Right 
 That's what we're looking at fifteen or maybe twenty
 We're not going to go longer than twenty
 But we're taking our time 
 We're going to try to make our decision by July
 Well we just started two or three weeks ago
 And we're not going to just kill ourselves 
 just two or three houses a week at the most
 Yeah
 Absolutely 
 Yeah
 Credit union has nine percent interest
 Yeah 
 So that's 
 I don't know 
 we couldn't think of a better time to buy than now
 But anyway Well I can't think of a whole lot more to say
 Yeah 
 Me too
 Yeah 
 same here 
 My wife she went to the school out there in Lubbock
 She was there for two or three years before we got married 
 I guess before I even met her
 Okay
 But anyway 
 She went to school there
 Cathy Walker

 Yeah 
 Thanks a lot

 You do

 That's interesting 
 I work in the waiver 
 really
 Yeah
 wow
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I'm turning in a capital request right now
 Yeah 
 That's funny that's where you're from
 A machine that puts back grind tape on and off the waivers 
 Yeah 
 I'm sort of an acting process engineer
 Not officially 
 but that's pretty much what I do
 Yeah
 Right 
 and 
 I like him 
 he's hard 
 but we needed that
 Yeah 
 he's 
 Yeah 
 that's what he said here
 He's gotten us into a linear flow that we've never been in before
 That's been a real big plus
 He's broadened the devices that we're making too which has made us as lot more stable
 Anyway well it was nice to talk to you
 They're are going to interrupt us any minute now 
 I can tell
 Okay 
 yeah
