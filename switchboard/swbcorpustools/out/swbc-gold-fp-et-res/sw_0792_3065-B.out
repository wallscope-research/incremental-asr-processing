 Well [ [ + I ] + I ] don't know 
 It's kind of a tricky question because I think it's a practical system
 obviously if it's all compatible and it you know tens 
 and things make sense 
 it's a switch 
 The problem would just be the switch over
 Right 
 That's when I was in the elementary school years 
 and We all learned that metric 
 and they were ready 
 we were going to be metric 
 and 
 Right
 So I think that's what they did at first was that they had metric 
 and there's things that we've gone metric 
 We have metric cola now
 you can buy that 
 and you can 
 you know so that we have little things that are metric 
 but no one talks about you know 
 you buy nine by twelve frames 
 you don't buy centimeter length frames and cooking pans
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 fifty-nine kilometers per gallon
 Yeah 
 That's 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it really would
 it's because I think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools trying to you know get that in our minds so that we could ch- 
 because I think our generation could make a change
 It would be difficult 
 but it would not be as difficult for people say fifty years old now who have never been exposed to the metric system other than you know buying a two liter Coke
 That's 
 Right
 Right
 Right 
 Right
 That's true 
 That makes sense
 Well I was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change 
 and you'd have to change your height on your driver's license
 When you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore you'd be a hundred and seventy centimeters
 and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in pounds
 So all the dieters would be happy 
 I only weigh sixteen today 
 That's 
 Right
 And they'd have to change that little ruler that's on the door of the seven eleven that tells you how tall the robbers are when they hold it up
 Right
 Right 
 this line which is seventy-three centimeters
 Just so you'll know 
 but that would be good That I don't know
 *[[ Looks like "That " should be an independent slash unit ]] Right 
 Because isn't it pretty much everywhere in the world 
 I know England is not metric
 I don't think they are because our measurements started in England
 all that began back there 
 and I think they're the only part of the continent that hasn't changed over to metric
 Right
 We're the trend setters in the world 
 I don't know why We haven't changed to the sensible system
 <> I don't know
 Right
 Well and it's not even base twelve for everything 
 is it 
 It 
 Well pounds 
 I don't even know what that 
 See and I don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces 
 It's 
 I don't know that I have that much concrete knowledge in the current measuring system that would prevent me from 
 It's not like it's really entrenched other you know 
 A lot of stuff 
 Right 
 I didn't even know that 
 Well that's good
 Oh
 Right
 Right
 Did you ever check it to see if it really was a pint
 
 Right
 Well that's 
 you all are nice business 
 Right
 Right 
 Probably ate all your merchandise too
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Yeah 
 it's a little problem 
 What's inside the jelly bean
 oh
