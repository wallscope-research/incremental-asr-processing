 Okay 
 what kind of hobbies do you have
 Uh-huh 
 I like to read too 
 I was trying to think of some while it was talking about it 
 and then I 
 it took so long for someone to answer 
 I started reading the newspaper and kind of forgot about it 
 But yeah 
 I'd say reading is probably one of my biggest ones because it's the type of thing that you can do a little bit at a time whereas I would love to do crafts and stuff if I just had the time to do it or if I had the space 
 I live in a pretty small apartment 
 and I would have to you know put stuff away 
 I have two cats 
 so I couldn't really leave it out if I was working on something
 Reading is a little bit easier to work around
 That's right
 That's true 
 I do the same thing 
 What types of crafts do you do
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 I enjoy sewing and needlework also 
 I've made some small things cross stitch things 
 And back when I was in high school I worked at a needlework shop 
 and I used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that 
 and I still remember how to do it 
 It's just been so long since I've actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that 
 But I have recently done some cross stitch
 And I enjoy doing that 
 It's just the same old thing 
 it's just getting the time to do it 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 it takes a lot of concentration 
 it was the type of thing 
 I was making some little things for Christmas 
 and I also made a little thing for a baby gift 
 and I thought I can do this while I watch T V 
 Wrong 
 No 
 you must pay all attention to what you're doing 
 it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be 
 It took me quite a bit of time 
 I though this won't take long at all 
 But I was wrong 
 it took a while to do 
 But it was fun 
 I enjoyed it
 my gosh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 That's pretty understandable
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 <> I'm trying to think of anything else I do as a hobby I don't even watch T V very much 
 I was tonight 
 but 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I do like to go to movies 
 and I have a V C R 
 so I like to rent movies 
 and right now I have the movie channel 
 so I've recorded quite a few movies off of that 
 just I've kind of got a collection going of tapes now 
 and whenever I go visit my parents they're always saying Well bring some of your tapes 
 They always borrow a few of them 
 I was over there 
 they live in Duncanville
 and I was over there at Easter 
 and they said Bring some tapes with you 
 So they are always borrowing my tapes
 But 
 I like to do stuff with plants 
 I have a lot of plants in my apartment 
 and I've got a pretty small porch 
 but it's 
 I've got a few planters out there that I'll you know 
 in the winter time I usually plant some pansies in there 
 and then in the summer I'll plant petunias 
 or something that's colorful 
 and like that blooms a lot 
 But haven't done that yet 
 I kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time 
 but I think we're probably past that now 
 I probably should go buy some
 I guess if I had a house I might enjoy gardening some 
 I'm not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that
 Yeah 
 I like the planting and watering is okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I don't know too much about it either 
 Mine's pretty limited to my little porch plants 
 And then the ones in my apartment half of which don't look real healthy 
 but I don't always get direct sun except in certain spots
 And so that's probably my problem there 
 But 
 No 
 I never have tried that just because I don't have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment or this little balcony 
 And my other two pots are 
 they're pretty big 
 and I have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area 
 so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood there's no room for much else 
 But my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house 
 And I think when I was real little I probably had a finger in on that every time he did it and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff 
 But I've never really tried anything like that since then
 Uh-huh
 wow
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Well I enjoy playing with my cats 
 I don't know if you'd call that a hobby 
 but I have two cats 
 and I gave them a bath tonight 
 so they're a little bit angry at me 
 They didn't like it too much
 Yeah 
 yeah
 right in the tub 
 and it helps because its the time of the year that they're shedding a lot and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine 
 So I thought this'll you know help them shed 
 and sure enough boy the fur just came off like crazy once I got them in the tub 
 So they're pretty content now 
 but they were mad at me for quite a while 
 They went and hid after they got dried off
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I like both 
 but since I'm in an apartment I don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog 
 to me dogs need a yard even little dogs
 They just need a yard 
 Cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine 
 But I just think dogs need to be outside though 
 So 
 Yeah 
 now that's an idea 
 with the small babies 
 Yeah 
 because you kind of 
 even a cat you never know when they might bite or scratch or something
 There not as likely to as a dog might I guess 
 But with little ones I'd be kind of scared to get anything that has teeth or claws
 yeah
 yeah 
 Uh-huh <>
 Yeah 
 probably 
 and I'm out of good ideas for a hobby anyway
 Well it was good talking to you
 All right 
 Bye-bye
