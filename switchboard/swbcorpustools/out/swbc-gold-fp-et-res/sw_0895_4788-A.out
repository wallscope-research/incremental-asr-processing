 I don't know 
 Your camping experience is probably 
 I don't know if they're similar to mine 
 but since I've had children it has changed a little bit
 but when my husband and I were camping we'd take this domed tent that is easily collapsible and go camping and just kind of roughed it 
 As long as there was a bathroom there and some clean showers and things like that then it was fine 
 But we'd get up at three in the morning and start on our little escapade for the day and kind of do a lot of different things and then stop when we wanted to 
 But that's kind of changed now 
 When you have a small child because they don't want to get up at three in the morning 
 and you don't want them up that early 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 We did a lot of different things 
 We'd stop when we wanted to that kind of stuff 
 So we kind of did a little bit of hiking sure and a little bit of sightseeing different areas sitting back at different areas and spending hours 
 we never had really a time limit 
 we just kind of did what we wanted to do for that day 
 Very comfortable 
 so 
 Well there's places in Wisconsin 
 There's the Apostle Islands which are in Bayfield which is a wonderful place 
 And then there's also what we found in the state of South Dakota the Black Hills
 And we just have this really good time there 
 One thing is they don't have mosquitoes 
 and sorry to say in Wisconsin we do 
 so that kind of puts a little bit of a hamper on your you know 
 if you're going to go camping who wants to deal with bugs 
 and 
 We found this one area that doesn't have mosquitoes 
 They just don't have them 
 and it's just wonderful not to be bugged all night long with a humming mosquito at your ear 
 so Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Sure
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Yeah 
 yeah
 That was really called roughing it 
 yeah
 I 
 Anymore 
 Yeah 
 see 
 Uh-huh 
 Sure 
 Uh-huh
 Than you 
 sure
 Than when you were younger 
 uh-huh 
 it 
 with kids they don't care if they take a shower everyday 
 With kids they don't care you know about a lot of things 
 But as adults it's like if I don't take a shower every day I feel like you know ooh 
 I just don't feel right 
 so There's lots of places if you're going to go camping 
 K O As are wonderful 
 it's kind of the yuppie type of camping because they have showers 
 they have things for kids to do 
 They have swimming pools things like that 
 If you can find some really nice clean campgrounds versus if you go to state parks 
 we have found state parks not that they're lacking 
 but they're certainly not up to a standard of a K O A where it's you know a little bit cleaner 
 You've got the showers available 
 It's not you know in the same category 
 State parks you know you get a little bit fearful too you know things like that simply because it they are supposed to be patrolled 
 but you know it's a little bit different 
 so we've always kind of stayed with a K O A and then did other things besides just sit at the campground at night 
 That's the only time you really use your campground 
 If you're going to be gone all day long walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire to sit back and watch a fire to enjoy that you know and then to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up that kind of stuff 
 So we never really spent that much time at the campground as much as we did
