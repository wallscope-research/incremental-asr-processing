 So what kind of music you into
 The opera yeah it's right on track 
 I like classical 
 but I can't deal with opera at all
 And heavy metal it's noisy 
 I'm into some industrial music that's a bit even harder than that
 But it's got to have a point to it
 Yeah
 What kind of progressive stuff
 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 it's a lot of people like saying that you know bands in that position you know sold out
 I think that's pretty much you know bull 
 Because R E M really hasn't changed 
 If it's interesting 
 They're producing similar music 
 and it's good music
 but you know people have picked up on it
 That's good
 I'm impressed
 yeah
 but he picked the right songs 
 and that's about all he had going for him Or still has for that matter
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 I'm sure that sold a lot for him 
 That's all you really need for a lot of pop 
 I've kind of like developed a short hatred for pop
 It just seems like there's no real point 
 You hear the same tune over and over again in a thousand guises 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I can believe that 
 What kind of things do you like in classical 
 What's the standard
 yes
 Uh-huh
 <> It's safe
