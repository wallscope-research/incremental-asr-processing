 Y- 
 no 
 I don't 
 an 
 my kids would love a pet 
 I had a pet when I was a girl 
 I had a Cocker Spaniel 
 And I think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company
 you can tell them anything 
 and they won't tell anybody
 Right 
 as a matter of fact I was thinking that same thing unconditional love 
 They just give it and don't expect too much 
 Anyway do you have a pet
 Oh <>
 I'm so sorry 
 But that's good that you're going to get another one
 I know some of my friends who have pets 
 and they just are really you know 
 the ones that have dogs are very protective of them 
 and I think that's one reason they have them especially older people that I know that have pets 
 But they just really take care of them or are protective of them
 Yeah 
 an 
 and my kids 
 they really want a dog badly 
 and they've been looking and looking 
 and want you know 
 they'd take anything I think 
 but I don't know do you like 
 I guess your cat was an indoor cat
 It kind of traveled around 
 travel 
 Yeah 
 when I had a Cocker Spaniel it was an outdoor dog 
 and I think I liked that better
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Take them for walks 
 right
 Yeah 
 I see all the people on Sunday going for a walk with their dogs 
 and I'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog 
 I'm like I know it will be fun the first week maybe
 and then mom gets to take care of it or something 
 So I gue- 
 that's exciting
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think it's really important to that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that you know we're not just going on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them 
 that kind of gripes on me some 
 but I don't know
 More and more people are 
 Right 
 right
 But 
 I think that's really true
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 exactly
 Exactly 
 I think our community is a lot more conscious now though too 
 and that's good too
 Well I think that's all I have to say
 Okay 
 have a good night 
 All right 
 bye-bye
