 And good afternoon to you
 no 
 I do most of my cooking at home 
 and I could safely say that I have never cooked for a dinner party
 
 Right 
 I'm in Dallas
 Of course dinner parties down here probably turn out to be more things like barbecues 
 And 
 Uh-huh 
 yes
 Yeah 
 Tex-Mex 
 Mexican food probably a little bit different than what you serve up in Pennsylvania for a dinner party
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Fried chicken
 Uh-huh
 yes 
 I have
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh

 Let's see 
 I'd probably put a bunch of fresh vegetables in 
 And some 
 Yeah
 green beans and carrots and things like that
 My green beans
 I just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes
 And I like to put a little Mrs Dash in with them
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 uh-huh 
 I like to just put a tablespoon or so of Mrs Dash in there
 And it makes them pretty tasty
 The Chinese type 
 Are they the real 
 No 
 I haven't ever used that
 Uh-huh
 A white powder
 gosh
 That's okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I might try that
 yes 
 I love Chinese
 North African
 Uh-huh

 Okay

 Bye-bye
