 So Utah
 that's the state that was famous when they executed somebody
 Gary Gilmore
 By firing squad as I recall
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well I yo- you know 
 until recently I've been sort of 
 could go either way you know 
 it sort of doesn't much you know 
 it didn't 
 it wasn't a strong issue I guess it still isn't a strong issue 
 But I must say I find it very silly the way politicians are running around creating more and more capital crimes instead of dealing with you know the real problems you know that they're getting votes presumably by 
 I assume they're doing it for that reason 
 by saying well this particular crime in this particular way is a capital crime now
 Uh-huh 
 it's not enough just to lock them up forever
 Not often
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well I 
 I've 
 it seems like it's gotten carried away 
 and I do find it hard to know where to draw a line 
 and so if I had to draw a line I'd say just no capital punishment 
 I don't see that it accomplishes a whole lot whereas I do think that convicting people and incarcerating them for a long time if that could be improved upon that would have more impact I think
 No 
 what about the argument where somebody who is committing one capital crime chooses to commit a more serious capital crime 
 murder because that one at least you might escape from because his victim you know his witnesses will be gone 
 doesn't this encourage More 
 yeah doesn't this encourage murder in order to wipe out the the witnesses
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 I see 
 so if William Kennedy Smith had been found guilty you believe he should have been executed
 A six person jury could have decided either way of course 
 Uh-huh 
 Well the problem is that they've just been let out of jail
 The problem there is that they've been let out jail 
 If they've been thrice convicted they should have been kept in longer
 Yeah 
 well 
 Yeah 
 that's for sure
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
