 I don't really have a favorite type 
 I like a lot of different types of music
 Yeah 
 I have a tape collection that I like to listen to cassette tapes
 but it's pretty varied
 Yeah 
 How about you
 That's exactly me 
 The acid rock or the heavy metal
 Even some of that I like okay but not mostly as a general rule 
 I don't care for that at all
 Well as far as the rap goes I think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves 
 and I like some of their songs
 But as 
 I agree with the general rule I wouldn't choose rap either
 But I like to listen to what you might call pop easy listening country western jazz classical 
 I don't 
 I like like I said pretty varied music
 I have a couple that my husband really hates that I listen to like Billy Holiday 
 I really love to listen to her 
 and I even have a tape of Lady Smith Blackman Bazo 
 and well they're very harmonic
 they really are
 So they're interesting to listen to 
 You might try that 
 How about you
 yeah
 It's too 
 you have to concentrate on it it seems
 What about the blues or something like that
 Uh-huh
 I like some of it 
 as far as like what they now call country western it doesn't sound like the old country music at all does it
 *[[two utts]] some of it sounds more like pop music
 n- 
 yeah 
 I don't care for that *[[slash error]] If I'm going to listen to today's country western I have tapes of like Randy Travis and Clint Black 
 and I even liked Jim Reeves you know
 or Merle Haggard and Faron Young
 that type of country western is what I like to listen to 
 Asleep At The Wheel *[[all caps for titles]] Sons of the Pioneers you know stuff like that
 *[[all caps for titles]] I like sound tracks a lot
 Yeah 
 it seems like you get a lot of original music that way
 you know think about like the Twin Peaks and stuff like that that's just real recent
 things like that I like to listen to 
 I like instrumental things
 I have some Spiro Gyro tapes
 they're wonderful
 I love them 
 I have some dulcimer music 
 I mean like I said that's pretty varied
 Al Jarreau he's somebody I like 
 He's kind of jazz inspired but still kind of pop too
 yeah 
 and you know what I like the most about him is {A I've gone to see him in concert and } he looks like he's having fun
 some people sing 
 and they have their faced all contorted like it hurts them or something 
 But he looks like he's having a good time 
 he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy and like all he wants to do is make the audience enjoy it too
 And he is real fun to listen to
 Bonnie Rait I like her a lot
 in fact whenever she won her big Grammy 
 I think it was like five of them or something
 was it five 
 or 
 Yeah 
 last year or the year before I can't remember 
 but I was listening to a particular radio station 
 and the one D J said who the heck is Bonnie Rait and why does she deserve five Grammies
 Well I vowed then that I was not going to listen to that radio station any more if that D J can make such a unedu-
