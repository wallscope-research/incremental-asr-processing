 Hi
 I'm wondering what camping means to you
 very good 
 That's sort of the same thing that I do 
 I don't think of trailers and campers and all this stuff
 do you do much camping
 you've never been camping 
 gee
 Well yes and no 
 and the 
 I haven't done much recently 
 but up until gee maybe five or six years ago I did a lot of it 
 and you know I've 
 Say
 No 
 I used to live abroad 
 and so I camped a lot in the Middle East
 and I was able to camp right in ruins which was always very exciting and a bit exotic for those who love bugs 
 and then when I used to come back to the states in summer we'd often go up to the lake country in New York with my brother's family and do camping there
 And you're not going
 that's too bad
 gee
 I guess it makes a difference 
 I grew up camping being in Girl Scouts and things like that 
 so 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 that's too bad 
 I think you know there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like 
 but maybe not you know the Canada men's trip but some other you know 
 a nice tent on the shore of a lake 
 and 
 Right 
 the no telephone the 
 gee whiz you go to bed when it gets dark
 and you get up when it gets light 
 Yeah 
 and I guess just the change from the rat race
 No 
 it's pretty isolated 
 and to me I like that I guess too although there are people 
 you know it's really hard to get away
 and I guess when we did sites in the Middle East of course it was with a group in order to make it safe
 but we'd go in different parts of the ruins and things like that 
 But we didn't even have tents there 
 we just sort of put out the sleeping roll 
 Right
 Right 
 Actually I just joined the Appalachian Trail Walking Club or whatever they call it 
 what 
 and I'm very eager to start 
 I love to walk
 and I'm going to start with day trips though because I don't know the territory and all 
 and I'm not sure 
 my son is not eager to go 
 and you know I think that that might be a little eerie at first going alone
 but you know I'm going to try 
 Well gee whiz 
 I hope you get into camping some day just slowly
 yeah
 Right 
 I think that you know 
 I guess one time recently we went up to Maine and had planned to camp 
 and you know the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field 
 and I said Gee whiz for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a motel which we did 
 and so that you know 
 if the setting was right and it's great 
 but if it's
