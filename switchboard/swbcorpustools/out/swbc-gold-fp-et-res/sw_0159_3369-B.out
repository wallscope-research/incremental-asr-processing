 Well I am a student 
 and I have been actually watching more movies on video than being able to go out to see movies at the theater 
 I want to see the FISHER KING and catch ROBIN HOOD
 let's see 
 I'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on 
 WHITE PALACE which I thought was over hyped recently 
 Well you're catching me at minds end here 
 What have you seen recently 
 Yes
 Yes
 Enjoyed that quite a bit
 I thought the cinematography was excellent
 the story was 
 though it tended to be a little one sided it was good 
 it was believable
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 they knew the extras or the 
 Uh-huh
 Scope
 Uh-huh
 it was 
 but it's a side that hasn't been told as far as you know telling it from you know the Indians as the good guys and the the white men as the bad guys 
 I really thought about all the westerns that we have seen for years and years
 and it's just shoot the Indians 
 and they are always the savages
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Yeah 
 that was a good movie 
 it was just kind of a get away movie
 Kind of 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yes 
 You're bringing it 
 I don't know 
 I sure did have a mind lock about the movies I've seen 
 But yeah 
 I've seen PRETTY WOMAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES 
 and 
 definitely
 Yes
 I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago
 and they showed all five in a row
 they had it everywhere 
 every major city had one theater that did it 
 and 
 Right 
 and they did it in Houston 
 well they did it everywhere 
 And it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed 
 and the thing that I didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row time wise they happen one after another and just no time between them 
 but you can watch the characters develop
