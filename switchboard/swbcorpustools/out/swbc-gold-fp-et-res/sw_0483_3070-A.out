 Well 
 on my father's side we've really there 
 On my mother's side we've had several 
 it's not really on a regular basis 
 but usually sometimes every few summers 
 Well see all the family lives in once place except for a few of us are scattered about
 So they're pretty much just reunited always
 so it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together
 I know 
 that's 
 do that 
 that's true
 How about your family
 Wow 
 you're a pro at this
 that's good
 And then where do you meet
 Okay
 Okay 
 Do you have relatives in Vernon then 
 Okay
 Right
 
 Right
 
 Right
 Okay 
 so this town hall that you meet in is that like a 
 Okay 
 Potato salad and 
 that's good
 Right 
 Right 
 that's nice
 Right 
 Do they always have the one person in the family who everyone thinks they know how to make this the best so that's what they get to cook 
 Well that's good 
 Well I had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions 
 so I learned a lot about them 
 I haven't been to a lot 
 but we talked a lot about the rituals 
 you all equated the family reunions as with the Protestant 
 It was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage
 it was an interesting theory 
 She talked about the Catholics 
 you know it's all family centered anyway 
 so you usually are living where your parents live 
 and it's all 
 you don't have to come home 
 so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe 
 but when the Protestant ethic happened in America there were people who ever went out and you know went away from the family to seek their fortune and then had to come back home for their reunion so that became their version of the pilgrimage
 But she had 
 it was interesting you know 
 I don't know how valid it is 
 but she talked about that and how the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together and you know about the bread and the ritual placement 
 Do you have a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every year 
 Is there kind of a you know 
 salads go first and things like that
 Right 
 Well that's pretty 
 Sure does 
 That's wonderful 
 Yeah 
 I wish we'd 
 Right
 Right
 Wow 
 <> You're just 
 that's incredible
 Right 
 Right 
 have you done this repetitively or just once
 
 See that's 
 we had a problem with that
 
 Right 
 was our problem 
 the first you know major reunion was probably six or seven years ago 
 And then the second reunion people who maybe you know had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought well it's not that big a thing this year 
 and so it kind of wound down
 and then finally you know you know you get the Shreveport relatives there but no one else 
 so that
