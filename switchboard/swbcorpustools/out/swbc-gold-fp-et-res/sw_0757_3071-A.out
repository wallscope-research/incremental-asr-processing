 I guess we're supposed to talk about music
 And let me go ahead and push one here 
 do you ha- 
 are you a musician yourself
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Where 
 do you sing in a choir or a choral group
 Uh-huh 
 What kind of singing do you like to do
 Yeah 
 uh-huh 
 have you been singing a long time 
 or have you studied
 Uh-huh
 Right
 really
 great 
 did you do that in Texas or somewhere else
 Oh 
 Whereabouts
 Uh-huh 
 that's wonderful 
 well I likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs 
 and then I didn't sing in a choral group until after I was married 
 and I sang in a couple of community choirs and then waited for a while 
 and now for about the last eight years I've sung in a church choir here in Texas 
 And so I enjoy just the chorals singing a lot as well 
 are you a soprano alto or 
 A soprano 
 Yeah so am I 
 Do you 
 and what kind of music do you like to sing 
 you were saying you had classical training 
 Do you have a particular composer that you like or a particular type 
 Uh-huh
 I've been listening to some advertisements for MADAM BUTTERFLY 
 and I'm wondering if you have ever done anything like that 
 if you had done MADAM BUTTERFLY 
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 yes 
 uh-huh 
 MADAM BUTTERFLY was in Dallas 
 it's been two or three years ago now 
 and then I went to see that 
 and it was really wonderful 
 It was particularly well 
 the acting was particularly nice I thought 
 and so it was quite popular 
 you don't play an instrument 
 so have you ever wanted to like guitar or piano or 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does you know some other kind of instrument 
 I think piano is always good background
 beginner 
 I played piano well I guess from the time I was five until I graduated from college 
 and then I was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school 
 so that was the instrument both of my children started on 
 but neither of them stayed with it 
 One of them turned into a violist 
 and the other one the boy is guitar and percussion 
 so 
 but the 
 I think that the piano background is very useful 
 and I'm sure that for you it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself just for practicing and so on
 Uh-huh 
 Do you have any other kind of music that you like
 Uh-huh 
 I have a 
 I used to work with a fellow who had 
 although this was a computer company he had his P H D in musical I guess it was in composition actually from University of North Texas 
 and yet when I would go into his office every now and then you never knew what kind of music he'd be playing on the radio 
 It may be country 
 it might be classical 
 it might be rock you know
 it was just he said that just about what you said that he just liked all kinds of music
 And that was neat for me to hear that somebody is 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 do you have any plans to do anything with your music in the near future 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I know that there are if you're interested in choral singing 
 I'm not sure where you are in Texas 
 but I do know that some communities have community choruses 
 and that's often a good way to get back into it again 
 it's not terribly demanding 
 You might have to audition 
 but that probably wouldn't be a problem 
 but there usually you know 
 that they take tours and things like that 
 and you get to know you know people socially as well as in a musical setting 
 so that's always fun 
 I think well that's one reason why I have enjoyed my choir so much is that not only do we sing wonderful music 
 but we've gotten to know each other quite well on a social level 
 and I think we sing better because of that 
 you know I think we sing more like people who trust each other which is really nice 
 So whereabouts in Texas are you if I could ask
 Flower Mound 
 okay
 Well I'm in Plano 
 so we're just not too far apart actually
 Uh-huh 
 It was funny 
 it's you know 
 I talk to people all over Texas {F um and only one person outside of the state 
 so I'm always asking where in the state you know the person is from if they're in Texas
 do you have a family
 Uh-huh 
 I was wondering if your spouse 
 or you know if you had other musical people in your family
 if you have other people in your family who are also musical
 Uh-huh
 Do you come by it naturally 
 were your parents that musical
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 That often is the case 
 the you know 
 sometimes it will skip 
 Like my husband is not musical at all 
 but his mother is very musical 
 and his children are very musical 
 so you never know where the talent is going to show up I guess sometimes 
 So well I'm not sure how long we've talked
 I haven't been paying attention to the clock
 But I'll bet we've done at least five minutes
 Well I've enjoyed talking with you Becky 
 and maybe we'll talk again
 Uh-huh 
 Bye-bye
