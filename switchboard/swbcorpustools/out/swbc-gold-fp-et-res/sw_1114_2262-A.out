 Well I haven't really lived in a lot of big cities 
 I'm living in Dallas now 
 Plano is outside of Dallas 
 so I don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution
 But I know when I lived down in Houston on the outskirts of Houston there were some towns like Pasadena that had oil refineries
 And if you would drive by there like on your way to the beach or something there would just be dumping this huge amounts of smoke into the air 
 and it always smelled really bad 
 We know that that was really really really bad for the atmosphere 
 What have you got up there
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 no
 Sure
 Yeah 
 it's just so bad that there is just so much going into the air 
 and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there and everywhere it all adds up
 *[[there> they're]] Plus all the problems in the Middle East 
 With all that smoke and 
 Yeah 
 So it's just why are we doing this to ourselves 
 I just don't know 
 but you know what really amazes me about like that Pasadena area and the oil refineries is that there would be houses and people living just really close to it
 between the freeway and the oil refinery you would see a neighborhood
 and you just thought well it's obvious that there's a lot going up in the air there 
 and what comes up must come down 
 Yes 
 and how if they have all of those 
 toxicity there's signs around saying how dangerous it is 
 and here you are living 
 That just doesn't make too much sense
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Well individual companies and things are so selfish
 And their desires to save a few dollars and that 
 they don't care about the environmental impact that they make
 Yes
 Huh-uh 
 Well have you ever visited like Los Angeles or any place it's kind of known that it has pollution in it's air
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 That's so awful 
 Well what about in New York 
 I guess you've gone that way maybe
 Pretty funny
 Well I've been to New York 
 I have relatives that direction
 We have 
 it's 
 where you are 
 *[[slash error; one utt with 4]] is it close to Phoenixville Pennsylvania
 Because I have family there 
 and 
 huh-uh 
 It's pretty neat
 That's beautiful country up that way 
 I know 
 it's very lush and pretty back in the east 
 It's really 
 Well I'm thirty-one
 Seems kind of old to me
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Yes
 That's really true 
 And we all you know need to be willing to help pay a little bit Like 
 I've heard some people grumble about their cars passing their emission tests and things 
 and how it's more expensive and things
 And I thought well it's so much better
 Huh-uh
 you don't
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Well I really think it must 
 I think every 
 well think about how many automobiles there are
 And each is putting out 
 like we have a car 
 one of our cars is an older car
 and every time you start it from the tail pipe it makes a black spot on the cement
 And you know that is a sign
 Yeah 
 And all cars are doing that 
 And it's really polluting the air
 Huh-uh 
 And it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer and things 
 We sure wouldn't want so much more people suffering from that
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Pretty sad
 no
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 No 
 No 
 It's scary 
 It's scary
 Huh-uh 
 It's really awful 
 Well I've really enjoyed the conversation 
 It's helped me to think more about some issues that I need to be thinking more about 
 Huh-uh
 And instead of waiting until it directly affects me like you say it's important to be involved ahead of time 
 Well you have a good day
 Thank you
 Bye-bye
