 Well that's a really hard question 
 I do know that politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths 
 I 
 let's example 
 our friend the President right now says no new taxes 
 we should and especially if anything be cutting taxes now because of the recession 
 and at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases 
 so I know the politicians aren't straightforward 
 Now in terms of economics I'm not 
 it's hard to call 
 It really is
 Right
 Yes 
 Well yeah 
 I'm not exactly sure about polio in particular 
 I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio
 I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio
 Right
 Yeah 
 it's funny because it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where you know Congress is able to attach all kinds of funny amendments for individual congressional districts to the main budget proposals 
 and the poor President has to either accept or reject the whole thing
 Oh
 I think the line item veto is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the President uses it to get rid of this kind of waste 
 On the other hand it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things and just to get rid of the unimportant things 
 And whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment there's always going to be a dispute as to where the boundary between waste and necessity is 
 So I'm not sure that that will help solve our problems 
 but there definitely is a problem with 
 I forgot 
 there's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something
 
 Pork barrel politics 
 there has to be some way to do it 
 I know state governors usually have line item vetos 
 and I lived in Massachusetts for a while 
 and when Dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular
 D- 
 at least at the end
 Yeah 
 they were very good at first 
 they were in very good financials at first 
 and that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well 
 And then of course the bottom fell out
 And spare the economy 
 Yeah 
 it's a hard balance it definitely is 
 Even not for government even just say for a small business 
 I know some
