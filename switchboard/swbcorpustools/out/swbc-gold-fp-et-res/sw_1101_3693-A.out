 Nancy do you have any children
 Oh
 Well that's nice
 That is lucky 
 Well how old does a child have to be before you get to stop making arrangements for him I wonder
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well and it's nice for them not to be alone
 Uh-huh
 Not after wor- 
 no
 Yeah
 She is
 Well I'm glad you have that opportunity to have your mom
 Well I have two kids five and six a girl and a boy 
 and so far I haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because I'm at home now full time 
 But when I was going to school I would go to school a time that my husband you know when he was at home
 so that we would just switch back and forth like that 
 But it's really scary 
 and I would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care 
 Uh-huh
 No 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Well that's nice
 And ] I know that I have done some babysitting myself 
 and 
 when I was in school and needed extra money 
 And I know how I felt as a provider of child care that even though you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to you know treat them equally and you know better usually better than your own
 it's not the same 
 and it made me realize that no one will love your child as much as you and your mother and the family 
 and no one will look out after them 
 and so far I think my preference would be rather than to have like a big day care 
 what is that like Kinder Care and things like that 
 rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something 
 I would prefer to have in home care either my own home or a neighbor or something
 Uh-huh
 Right
 It is hard
 No
 No
 And I know when I pick my kids up from school they want to come home 
 and I would hate for them to have be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation 
 So I think my preference if I had to find day care would be a small someone that I knew 
 Uh-huh
 No
 Well that's true because even now when they're gone to school it seems like there's just not enough time left over *[[two utts]] in the day 
 And by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time 
 and there's just not enough time in the day to do anything good quality for them 
 but that's really
