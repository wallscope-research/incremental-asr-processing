 Are you a T Ier 
 or 
 really 
 that's great 
 my daughter talked to a student 
 in general most people doing this are T Iers 
 but I guess customers too 
 Yeah 
 T Is got a lot of advances in it really 
 hopefully this will turn out to be a good program for us 
 We sure need the business 
 Okay 
 Current Events 
 you've got the question you can go first there since I called
 that 
 you're the opposite of me 
 I drive an hour each way to work 
 and so if I just use time 
 and not say one which quality is the best 
 I guess that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio 
 and then newspapers and T V would be tied after that because maybe I'll catch the evening news like ten o'clock on T V 
 and I 
 so that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper
 I really 
 of course you're in a different part of the country 
 I really listen to a lot of the talk shows I don't mean the gossip ones 
 but there's a lot 
 on the weekends when I do chores or whatever 
 I'm a radio hound I guess 
 I take the radio with me when I'm working on my car the lawn or whatever 
 and turn on 
 they have everything from lawn work lawyers news veterinarians all kinds of items 
 so a real radio buff especially when I'm doing chores
 Yeah 
 I find it surprising Because a lot of times it here you know 
 I'll talk to some people here 
 and I'll mention some talk host 
 and I'll expect them to have an opinion on why I don't like him and don't listen 
 they don't even know you know what the guys name is Bruce Williams who does financial work all over the United States 
 Most people haven't heard of Bruce Williams 
 You probably haven't either unless you're a radio buff
 He is in New Jersey and is entrepreneur and kind of a self-made millionaire 
 And he has it 
 I 
 well it's five seventy here 
 I'm trying to 
 it's on Cliff 
 I don't know what the 
 he's on all stations 
 You might remember the name Bruce Williams 
 and he is again national and talks about a lot of financial things 
 But the here I just get a kick out of 
 well we do a lot of gardening here 
 so there's 
 we have an excellent gardener here 
 has three hours on Sunday and three hours on Saturday 
 Of course that's not exactly current events 
 But I am kind of a radio buff
 For music 
 Yeah
 yeah 
 That's good 
 Actually 
 that's good
 My wife always wonders about that 
 she says look at that person he's driving and reading at the same time 
 Yeah
 Right
 we get 
 Go ahead 
 Good point 
 That's a good point
 yeah 
 It comes and goes 
 Yeah 
 Local you mean 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Don't they have city council meetings and all that 
 Are you into any of that what's going on in the city council and the school boards and all that 
 We have that addition to our paper
 Okay 
 you get it from people then
 Yeah 
 Right
 My wife and I you know as mentioned 
 the question was do you get it from people too 
 and I can say the same thing you do that my wife she reads the paper from front to back 
 and so she'll tell me some stuff 
 and she'll always get mad and say you didn't read the 
 well I always read the sports 
 what am I thinking of the commentaries 
 I can't even think of what it is offhand 
 and she's always reading something 
 and she says why haven't you read that 
 And I say I never have time to read it like you do 
 But I always get a lot of my information from the newspaper through her
 so I guess we do get it from people too 
 you mentioned C N N of course I mentioned radio and the C N N T V news you know
 It's the same thing that's on the radio word for word
 Yeah 
 it [ Well it is C N N exactly because 
 and it 
 because 
 we have it here at work as a matter if fact at T I
 We have it in the break area C N N 
 but the reason I say that is on the radio they'll say look at this you know 
 And when I first heard C N N it only started about since the war you know or right before that 
 And they would always say look at this 
 and there would be a pause you know would be music and stuff 
 and I realized that it's the exact commentary that you have on the the news
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 But it's still good 
 It's still you know 
 you don't really miss anything
 But I do enjoy since the Gulf War listening to C N N radio too as well as watching C N N on T V here at work 
 I don't have C N N at home 
 <> Let me turn this radio off 
 I'm actually at work right now believe it or not 
 where was I 
 I'm 
 go ahead 
 your turn
 Yeah 
 I've heard that 
 yeah 
 Right 
 Right
 yeah
 Yeah
 I never get home early enough for those five and six o'clock
