 Yeah
 Is that right 
 I know some other people that have done that
 
 Uh-huh <>
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 we have some friends that did exactly the same thing
 you know they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed 
 and finally they realized that they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole 
 and they just cut them all up except for one they kept for emergencies 
 and they're still paying away to get out of debt
 But no 
 I did just the opposite 
 I guess I sort of followed in my parents' footsteps 
 I have quite a few of them 
 I use them continually
 but I basically never charge anything I don't have the money in the bank to pay for 
 and I always pay them off totally every month 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and they're just a convenience for me 
 I don't have to get cash out of the bank 
 and I don't have to be writing checks 
 and 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's easy 
 you don't have anything transferring just a little signature 
 so what you know 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Surprising
 Yeah
 Well you know but the 
 there are some inherent limits there 
 you're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that 
 right
 Now I 
 W- 
 the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really you know not so much discipline 
 well you have sort of a discipline in general about finances 
 but I hate their interest rates so badly that I 
 I'm thirty-three
 Thirty-two 
 excuse me
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 You know that just irritates me so much that I refuse to pay them interest 
 and my wife recently decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off 
 and she's from there and didn't really have the money 
 but you know she could pay it off 
 and so I sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards 
 but she's paying it 
 and I just won't do it 
 she's paying I don't know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest
 and you know I just refuse to give it to them 
 If I need to borrow that kind of money I'll go to the bank 
 and 
 You know 
 Income 
 yeah
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 High 
 I might 
 
 Right
 I might try that because I have one card that I've had for about I don't know nine or ten years
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 for me the big thing you know is the annual fee 
 and I just refuse 
 I won't get any card now 
 I've got a good rating 
 and I've got you know 
 And I'm not going to pay an annual fee 
 The only one I actually pay on is this one that the very first
