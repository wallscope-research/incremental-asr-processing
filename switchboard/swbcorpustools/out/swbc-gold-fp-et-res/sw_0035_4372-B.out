 So let's talk about the wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order 
 and after the fact the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it 
 What do you think 
 Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there
 what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though 
 what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying income tax on something that you purchase mail order
 Well it seems to me that generally at least in my own experience when I purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania 
 It's because the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
 it's because I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area 
 So I go outside the area for that 
 And I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though you know the revenue stream went to another state 
 I don't think that that's my responsibility as a conscientious consumer
 Well I think that if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion then I don't argue with it 
 Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that I bought this out of state 
 I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania
 Right 
 But the point is is that businesses do that 
 The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question 
 That's a cost of doing business 
 The burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer
 
 do you mean businesses from the point of view of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax Or purchasing
 Yeah 
 See I'm unfamiliar with that because I never see that end of the business
 So my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer 
 but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something can be avoided
