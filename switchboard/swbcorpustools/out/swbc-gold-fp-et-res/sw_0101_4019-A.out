 Okay Chuck do you have any pets there at your home 
 And what kind do you have
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Well we have a cat 
 he's probably a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby
 how's the disposition of your Siamese cat
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well yeah 
 he has been really aggressive especially towards my little girl for some reason 
 He's been so mean to her 
 We've had him for about two years
 and he was so mean to her right after we first got him 
 So we had him neutered and declawed 
 and now he bites her 
 He can't scratch her any more 
 he bites her
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 he has a couple of times 
 so 
 But he's a very possessive cat 
 he loves my son 
 it's his cat 
 and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him
 and he's so funny 
 he just follows my son around just like a dog
 He won't even let my son shower
 He meows and wants to get in the bathroom 
 and while he showers it's so hilarious 
 So he's quite a animal 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well we did actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know because we just couldn't have him being so aggressive towards the girl 
 but he seems to have mellowed out a little bit 
 and we do keep our daughter away from him 
 So 
 Were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house 
 It is 
 uh-huh 
 we tried a dog about four years ago and we ended up with malamute and some other kind of mix 
 Anyway it ended up being just a huge dog that ate us out of house and home 
 So we gave him up and tried
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 we're in a house 
 but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog 
 we couldn't allow him to run free 
 so he was just chained up all the time 
 and it was unfortunate 
 So have you tried any other pets
 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 my word
 my word
 And do they just paper train it or something
 Yeah 
 Well rabbits are darling 
 That would be fun if you could get them trained 
 Otherwise they're pretty smelly 
 
 Huh-uh 
 we don't have cable 
 
 
 Is that right
 
 Uh-huh
 Well I'd be interesting to watch
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 Elton 
 We live out here it's by Ogden 
 It's north of Salt Lake City Utah
 and we really love it out here 
 It's kind of country 
 we're only about ten minutes from Ogden
 So we're kind of country but not too 
 No

 Do you
 well see I'm getting so many calls to Texas
 well great 
 Yeah 
 I've been doing it for about two weeks 
 and No my
