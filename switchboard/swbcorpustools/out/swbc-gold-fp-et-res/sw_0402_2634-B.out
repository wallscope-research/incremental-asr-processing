 Well me being from Texas 
 I hope you're ready for this
 Well I'm not your stereotypical Texan 
 I was raised around guns hunting
 So I don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect
 I respect them and what their capabilities are
 And on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a Green Beret I definitely respect the power of weaponry
 And here in Houston as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country 
 and here you go 
 here you 
 this will be border line N R A which I am not a member of
 When you've heard the slogan if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns
 Well you've got 
 well any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs 
 and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such
 And they get out their little Mac tens 
 they get out there little uzis 
 and they're going to fight with them 
 And it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm 
 If they want it they'll get it 
 I don't care if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it 
 they'll get it 
 and they'll get across the border 
 Now my position although I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon anyway 
 Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a felony if I wanted to buy one I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it 
 If they want to run a background check on me fine 
 If they want to put a seven day waiting period fine again
 If they want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that I've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county that's fine too
 Well 
 well the criteria the sheriff would have to follow is this guy a convicted felon 
 is he a habitual trouble maker 
 Are we picking him up every Saturday for a drunk and disorderly 
 and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems 
 You know just proving that you're a basically a good citizen 
 if they want the firepower they can get it
 because it doesn't matter how restrictive you're border control points are 
 they'll get it across the border one way or the other
 okay 
 Let- 
 go back to that one to ten scale where one being full gun control ten being none
 I'd said about an eight
 I said the restrictions I would like to see for anybody whether it being for handgun a rifle a shotgun 
 I would like to see them go through either 
 I'd like to see a law enforcement agency not N R A 
 but whether it be your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun 
 You got to go through there course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon how to safely handle the weapon how to properly maintain it the three basics
 Well the han- 
 in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon as a pistol
 Well there's 
 not necessarily a price thing 
 What is happening at least in this state 
 and I expect to see it in other states very soon 
 legislation been introduced that if a citizen of the state being myself has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course I can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or uncon- unconcealed
 Okay 
 you're from California right
 L A area
 Okay
 Okay 
 You've been to the city
 And all these people come around 
 someone attempts to mug me I would ju- 
 I would 
 as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched because I can meet him blade for blade
 Now if this legislation comes through 
 he pull- 
 I'm out with my family
 we've gone shopping 
 we're fixing to get in the car 
 this guy comes up 
 he pulls a blade on me 
 I can pull a gun on him now 
 and when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick
 Then it's still equally matched 
 having spent time in combat I feel it before they'll get the gun on me
 If I'm at the same time 
 actually it's no- 
 it's more of a police action in itself 
 the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying well I'm going to mug this guy right here 
 but hey he's carrying just as much firepower as I can 
 And if they're sca- if you got to go through a certification course to get to where you can carry it in public then this individual also knows this guys pretty good with it 
 Now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not that's another trip
 but 
 In defense of myself defense of my family or defense of my friends I can blow somebody a way in a heart beat even more so when it comes to my wife and son
 anybody tries to hurt them I won't even blink
 this is where the question of gun control comes in
 What I consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot
 Say a person get 
 all of a sudden my combat in me goes up 
 and say I've got the vibes this guys fixing to do something 
 I go ahead and pull my piece
 And I make sure this persons sees it so that he's got now doubt that I will use it on him 
 and I will use it right then
 If he doesn't back-up at that point he deserves what he gets because I have sent the clearest signal you mess with me you mess with my family I'm going to dust you 
 As it stands now I've got to do that with a blade 
 And the only reason I feel comfortable doing that is because of the training I've had
 Well if I'm the one doing the shooting I don't miss 
 That's the kind of training I've had
