 Lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do 
 I'm a putterer 
 I chose that topic because I really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 We've had a late fall 
 it seems like the weather 
 in fact today it's really warm 
 and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up 
 but you know you need to pretty soon
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So now you have the chance to really create and spread out
 Uh-huh
 The grass not growing so fast 
 Oh
 
 ours seems to have slowed down here 
 We're not having to mow every week religiously
 but we're still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the summer flowers out
 I still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year
 Uh-huh
 But like today it's eighty-five degrees
 it's really strange
 But that'll change real quick 
 We'll wish we'd planted bulbs and pansies already
 my gosh
 Well Texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants because our summers are so terribly hot
 and we have ice storms every year 
 And there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes 
 Some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings
 Uh-huh
 Well for the most part we don't 
 but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold 
 Well the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter
 but the ice storms really are stressful on all the plants that we have around 
 We've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to and pittosporum 
 that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time
 you really take a chance with them freezing
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Except for the lack of trees out where we are It was all cotton fields 
 and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful we really miss it
 Uh-huh
 
 Uh-huh
