 Well do you have time to read the paper in the morning
 You know a lot of people don't take newspapers at all 
 we took the MORNING NEWS for a while
 and then well we've been taking the TIMES HERALD for ages 
 and then dog just ran off with my shoe that's off the subject went outside picked it up and ran off 
 Anyway and then we switched the MORNING NEWS 
 but we found we couldn't read enough of it 
 and by the time I got home and had time to read some 
 but I guess the issue is beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines
 did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about Pete Arnett and the news coverage
 Well any you know TIME magazine and even the news that 
 sometimes that 
 that's why I like some diversity the idea that we have TIME which we take from time to time 
 and we 
 the problem is they call up and make this deal you know 
 and well we're taking that 
 and we also hit the Garland GARLAND DAILY NEWS 
 I guess it comes out sporadically like twice a week or some- 
 but I think what's interesting is that as difficult as it is or as much as they try they put some bias 
 I had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group 
 and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial
 And that 
 but and you know people accuse them of controlling the news he says you know we don't control the news we just report it the way it is
 And 
 Yes
 Yeah 
 and I thought that was particularly interesting in the Gulf War that there were pieces of information that were apparently leaked just as a ploy
 Which was 
 I find that fascinating that 
 I listen to K R L D and K L I F the news talk radio
 And I actually listen to C N N radio 
 Do you know it was on radio now
 It's on eleven ninety
 Well when I go to work I listen
 Yeah
 Well with your you know 
 if you're around the home though and can watch T V and read the paper the problem is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is 
 and then they start repeating everything
 and so it's kind of a 
 that's what's interesting is the C N N 
 I don't think I'm trying to think if it's much local 
 I listen to a little of that 
 and I listen to a little of ninety point one 
 I'm inveterate switcher
 That and ninety-eight point seven I'm eclectic approach
 Well I watch channel five 
 but that has to be 
 that's another bias
 That has to do with the weather reporting 
 I'm not sure that 
 actually I think channel eight is probably 
 but I know Dave Fox 
 he goes to our church 
 so 
 Well the Channel eight when they came here thirteen fourteen years ago Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together from Oklahoma City 
 and apparently channel eight was way down 
 and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job 
 and then they've been some people move around 
 and John Chriswell is anyway the 
 I don't know 
 do you seem to 
 can you tell much difference between the local radio T V stations
 I think that adds to the diversity 
 I think that I like that
 there I know you know John Wylie Price 
 I don't know if you kept up 
 but he's been protesting
 Yeah 
 and I think he has legitimate argument 
 you can 
 I grew up in Alabama 
 and so I have some prejudices
 But I think that from a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station
 I'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs 
 but I think that in some cases this should be some real opportunity and some diversity and this kind of thing 
 and I think that Dallas it turns out though from what I understand has quite good 
 I occasionally go to Saint Louis
 And there for a few days and watch the news and think Dallas really does have quite good news 
 I think channel eight is the number one A B C affiliate in the U S 
 I think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he 
 Course he pumping his own <> 
 Where'd you move from
 Yeah
 It is interesting though 
 it becomes a little of personality 
 In fact the guy that was on the weatherman on channel eight worked for me long time ago twenty years or so even longer than that Twenty-one twenty-three years ago or so twenty-four anyway long time ago 
 and shortly after we got here fourteen years ago 
 and they had fired him because he was too t- 
 anyway he didn't have the personality and wasn't drawing the crowds 
 and that's interesting 
 that's what the T V stations do 
 they're trying to get ratings
 And I think if we remember that they're out after the ratings 
 Well it's like the Dale Hansen on channel eight sometimes a little too cutesy 
 but I wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes 
 have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes
 Okay 
 well good talking to you
 Goodnight
