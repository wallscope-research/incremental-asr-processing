 <> Okay 
 How do you get your news mostly
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well I can hardly wait for my morning paper to come
 So that's the first thing I want is the headlines 
 It's really funny because my sister grabs the sports and I grab the headlines 
 and then when five o'clock comes around I just want to get in the house and turn the T V on to watch the news
 It's really weird 
 I don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long 
 But I love to watch the five o'clock news 
 and makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where I can read my paper 
 I do have my radio going most of the day though 
 so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too you know
 But 
 No 
 Uh-huh 
*[[listen; mistranscribed 'uh-uh']] I just have a channel that has music except for like every hour you know say eight o'clock nine o'clock they come on for just a little bit of the news
 But as far as the actual news I get that <> from the 
 can you hold on just for a second
 Just a minute 
 <> <> Hello sir <>
 Yes 
 I'm sorry to keep you waiting 
 I was calling from work 
 and that was a call waiting
 Yeah 
 yo- 
 That's true too
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well you're right 
 There is a lot of it that's just garbage as far as I'm concerned you know
 But I just like the daily news you know Just especially the weather 
 I like that 
 Although they're usually wrong 
 Uh-huh 
 But like I say as far as actually listening to the news it's mostly T V five o'clock to six thirty 
 that seems like a long time for news 
 but that's how long it is
 And seems like they have the local news and they have the world news
 And then my morning paper I can hardly wait for it to come
 And 
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 right 
 Once you get to work I wouldn't either 
 huh-uh
 But I've always been a morning person to get up you know
 but I can't stay up late at night to watch the late news 
 so I guess that's why I watch it at five o'clock 
 But anyhow Well listen I guess that's about it then
 It's been nice talking to you Tony
 really
 well that hasn't happened to me yet 
 So you never know 
 it might this time
 Okay Tony
 Uh-huh 
 Bye-bye
