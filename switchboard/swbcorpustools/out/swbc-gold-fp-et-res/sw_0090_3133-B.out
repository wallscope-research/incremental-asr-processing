 Okay 
 No
 Yeah 
 I think it's a good idea 
 I think everybody should put in their time so to speak for the good of the nation and for the good of themselves
 I think it's 
 would everyone grow up and mature and realize what this country's all about
 Did you 
 <> Oh <>
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Really 
 Yeah 
 I think that's probably like quite a few things that the kids maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through you know 
 they did things for people you know for their communities for their families for their friends where now I'm not sure they really do
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's probably true You know 
 but even through those groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think that's probably true
 I think it's probably more true still in the smaller communities then in the larger cities
 Well I live in Richardson right now Which is just 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 okay 
 Yeah
 Gosh 
 I hadn't even thought about it being out of the area 
 but you're right 
 Yeah 
 I grew up in a real small town in Florida
 I mean a real small town 
 And I think it was just 
 of course it was back in the fifties 
 and I think it was real prevalent back then 
 I think people thought more of others than they do now You know as far as doing things for them and then gaining benefits from it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I do to 
 I do to
 I'm not sure that today's kids would go for it though 
 I think you would have to start younger
 I don't know how young you'd have to go 
 but I think by the time they're early teenagers anyway I think it's too late now At least around here
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think it has to start in the families first because if you don't do it for your own immediate family you're sure not going to do it for anybody else
 Uh-huh
 That's probably true 
 That's probably true
 Uh-huh 
 that's great
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Well that's great 
 I'm glad that there are still some areas that get the youth involved in that sort of thing
 Like I said I think it does 
 even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes <> 
 Well 
 No 
 no 
 I guess that's about all
 Okay
 Well good talking with you
 You too
 Okay
 Bye
