 Okay 
 First off speaking of air pollution I'm coughing 
 I'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly 
 I find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use cause the air pollution
 It doesn't seem like 
 but I guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know 
 and it's kind of dangerous
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 But you think the mountains are kind of a barrier
 
 That's an interesting thought
 Uh-huh
 Here in Texas I know pretty much every place here is relatively flat 
 and so I would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of like a smog problem or something like that
 
 Uh-huh
 I gue- 
 I gue- 
 yeah 
 I guess I've never really thought about the fact like in California they have a lot of smog problems
 And it's real hilly there
 So that is probably something that plays a big factor 
 I think probably just a lot of factories you know they have the smoke stacks I guess you call them and different things like that
 Uh-huh
 Aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something
 
 okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 the diesel
 yeah
 I know a lot of people with diesels 
 truck you know
 But 
 No 
 I don't
 I work in Waco at a T V station
 My mother works at T I
 That's why 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 You work at T I
 okay
 Okay
 okay
 That's interesting
 What else causes air pollution 
 Noise
 Noise causes air pollution 
 Yeah 
 that's why I thought of it
 Oh
 Yeah
 Landfills
 We just 
 Yeah 
 We just had a big thing here in Waco 
 They're needing to open a new landfill or to expand onto the old landfill 
 And it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded because they're thinking that they're water is going to be contaminated somehow
 And so they 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 one of the big concerns is there's a school right across the highway from the landfill
 Yeah 
 So the parents were really really upset
 Yeah
 they've been fighting over it for the last year 
 and they just now approved it 
 So they're going to try an appeal or something
