 So what things do you consider an invasion of privacy
 I don't know 
 I had a little bit more time to think about it 
 I was thinking of like 
 I don't know 
 I started to think about all the big you know data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those you know demographics studies that they do that you know have who knows how much you know stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere 
 and I don't know 
 I don't know what they actually have in there 
 but I know they sell those 
 Yeah 
 that was the other one I was thinking of 
 I think that's 
 I know drugs are illegal 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well I think that you know a person's competence should be more determined by you know their actions and their behavior 
 and you know if they're on some kind of you know controlled substance then you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person you know who is able to evaluate them 
 I think they should be evaluated that way rather than with you know a chemical you know 
 These people that are carriers and that don't reveal it
 Yeah that would be kind of an extreme
 I've heard of things like you know you know marking them somehow you know or something like that or you know putting them all someplace like in a kind of 
 Yeah 
 Wel- I guess it kind of borders on what do you value more The invasion of the person's privacy or the possible danger to you know other people
 Yeah
 I guess that's been the big role of government I guess generally 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well that's kind of a difficult one to go into 
 I mean that particular case
 Because there's a lot of people that they could require you know obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because you know there's a huge part of the population 
 not a huge part but a you know 
 the AIDS population I guess that have it that don't know they do are spreading it 
 But again to require you know such a test and then to make it is to subject them to discriminatory practices and other things 
 I don't know 
 I don't know how exactly I feel about that
