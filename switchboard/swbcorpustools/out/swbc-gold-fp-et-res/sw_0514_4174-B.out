 Okay 
 well Mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is in the situation of choosing college
 She's actually at Bible College for this current year
 And I guess first and foremost it's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then which colleges or universities can best offer that program 
 and then it comes down to the dollar 
 You have to 
 it's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction 
 or *[[slash error]] you know it does 
 *[[sv]] it comes down to trying to come with a trade off of the costs
 what do you feel about come of the things that need to 
 No 
 y- 
 the college 
 the catalogs are sales material
 It doesn't matter whether you know they're selling school
 and true 
 it really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school 
 I guess there's a difference in 
 here the 
 at least the university here in Saskatoon is primarily off campus resident students 
 Like they just live in the community
 you know I know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is is right on campus as well
 and you know that changes the character of it quite a bit
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I guess we're here 
 this is the university that has for years had the car that will travel the farthest on a small quantity of gas 
 *[[utt 3 & 4 one utt]] our engineering students
 in competitions 
 and that's the kind of thing that also if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school 
 whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a spirit of somewhat unkind but producing graduates
 you know as sort of some development and some training 
 like it's easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them
 and that can vary between colleges and faculties even as to you know what the attitude towards achievement is
 do you have anyone that you're seriously needing to feed information to 
 I suppose if you're actually at Georgia Tech as a student you're a ways away from that
 Right
 Well that's really a valid point that people need to consider as well
 you know to 
 going to university is going to take four to eight years depending on the programs person's involved in 
 and after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself
 and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market 
 jeez 
 if that's 
 Right 
 Best training in the world is not going to put food on your table
 But
