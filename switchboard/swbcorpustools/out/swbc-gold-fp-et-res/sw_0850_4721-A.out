 You want to go first 
 Really
 Well yeah 
 I do a lot of exercise 
 Right now I'm into jazzercise which I absolutely love 
 I started about two years ago because I gained some weight over the past few years 
 and I wanted to get it back off
 and I was going through a divorce 
 and I just found that running really made me feel good
 Got out a lot of aggression 
 I went to the gym every day 
 and I ran on the treadmill and rode the bike 
 and I felt really good 
 I needed to do it 
 and it was really helpful at the time 
 Now when I do those things they're boring 
 I would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place
 And so I just recently discovered jazzercise about two months ago 
 And I'm getting to be a good dancer from it 
 and I'm just feeling really good 
 I love the class 
 it's real challenging 
 so I'm really into that
 I really like that a lot
 it's aerobics 
 but it's with dance steps
 It's an aerobic exercise 
 and it's an hour straight 
 And it's a lot of fun 
 I feel like I'm not just exercising Because I'm dancing 
 and I'm getting much better 
 My stamina is getting great for the dance floor 
 so it's just 
 there's a lot of positive things with it 
 so 
 It is inside 
 and I've been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having 
 and I just enjoy that much more too than inside 
 I have a thirteen year old daughter 
 and so we go bike riding 
 and it's nice 
 We get to spend some time together rather than I go to the gym while she does her homework
 So I've enjoyed that part of it 
 Yeah 
 And at the gym even in the class I 
 it's not really a group where you chat a lot 
 Everybody's on their way to someplace
 and so you know I do have one friend who goes occasionally 
 but basically I do it by myself in a group of maybe forty 
 so 
 there are 
 It's more motivating that way I think 
 Yeah 
 You could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the T V 
 but i- 
 you probably wouldn't
 So 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I can see it'll be a good break 
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 <> Yeah 
 <> Yeah 
 I think you do 
 You feel very good after you exercise 
 I think it's worth making the time for yourself 
 You owe it to yourself 
 and I think you do accomplish more after that
 And I think that it's just is good for your self-esteem for everything because when you look better you feel better 
 and it's just 
 I think it's well worth it 
 I just demand that time for myself 
 Now I've learned to do that
 you know and I think it just benefits you all around 
 So 
 You have to 
 Because there's always more things to do
 There is always things that you can make priority to it 
 but I don't demand a lot for myself 
 and so you know I just feel entitled to it 
 and I take it 
 so 
 No 
 I've done some walking with friends in the past
 But I find that when you do that you do more chatting than you do exercise 
 and that's not really beneficial 
 so I don't have time like that 
 and I spend enough time chatting around everywhere you know
