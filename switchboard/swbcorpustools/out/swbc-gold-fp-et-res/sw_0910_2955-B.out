 just barely
 Yeah 
 I am twenty-nine
 So 
 Yeah 
 But 
 just yeah 
 exactly 
 Had some friends that were in it
 Really 
 Wowie
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well I think it is basically the same way 
 It certainly has affected U S policy though 
 there is no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the thing in Iraq
 Because the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam it was no different from Iraq 
 I mean it was one country picking on a smaller weaker one
 Yeah 
 The only difference was that the government said okay 
 if we were going to support this smaller country then we are going to support it a hundred percent 
 And we are going to consider ourselves against in war against these people as well
 Which 
 Right 
 Which really was not the attitude with Vietnam 
 It was sort of a president's war rather than a country's war
 Right
 Yeah 
 it seemed like it was going on forever 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 right
 Of course now everyone's more you know environmentally intelligent than they were back then 
 back then it was not commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things that people know about themselves now
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I do not know if they have that resource or not
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well you know a little bit more than I do 
 explain it 
 I did not get to live through it 
 the people that I know that it did felt very strongly 
 Most of 
 I work for a government contractor
 So at least some of the guys I work with rather are veterans
 And from Vietnam
 And I have not talked to any of them that were not you know glad that they went or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one
 You know most of them are very strongly that the reason for America to be there was a good one
 They just felt that the way America backed them up was not at all right
 Yeah 
 In term of 
 Yeah
 Personal level 
 and the finances how they started You know 
 like air attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy
 Because the Congress would not approve you know 
 So Yeah
 
 I 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 right 
 the ticker tape parade and all that
