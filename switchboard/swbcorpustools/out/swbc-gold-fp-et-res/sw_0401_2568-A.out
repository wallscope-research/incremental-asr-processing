 Okay
 Well actually what I do 
 I haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months
 so I haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater 
 but I rent probably four or five movies a week
 We've got a good video place out here 
 and gosh I'm just trying to think of all the movies I've recently seen 
 AIR AMERICA
 Have you seen WILD ORCHID
 Well it depends 
 do you like steamy movies 
 okay 
 what type of movies do you like
 Bu- d- 
 Okay
 Yeah
 Do you like suspense movies 
 or do you like just action 
 or 
 JAGGED EDGE 
 JAGGED EDGE was a suspenseful one Or FATAL ATTRACTION
 well I hope I don't run across them
 What was your favorite all time movie
 I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most that I was really the most in shock with was probably STAR WARS
 When that first came out I really did not expect the special effects or anything like that
 I guess out of all the movies I've never been as excited to go back 
 I was ready to go back and see it again you know 
 Now I also liked GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA
 you haven't
 yeah
 No 
 that's a real interesting movie 
 and it's got a good historical perspective to it
 yeah
 Actually I just saw a movie called THE LOST CAPONE
 And it's about Al Capone's brothers Primarily one of his brothers 
 and I won't give the whole plot away 
 but it's really a good movie 
 Al Capone had three brothers
 and one of them was lost for many many years 
 and he turns out to be a law man
 Yeah 
 it's really interesting 
 it 
 No 
 that's okay 
 I didn't give away the whole thing 
 I just gave away just enough to get you interested 
 Yeah 
 it is
 And a lot of times what I wind up doing is picking say an actor or an actress and seeing like all 
 I've seen all of James Dean's movies all of Mae West's movies 
 And just kind of go out and rent all the movies and you know just kind of go 
 I guess you could do that you know get all of David Carradine's movies or Segal 
 to 
 what's his first name 
 I can't remember his first name
 Is it David Segal 
 I don't know 
 he was on Arsenio just recently
 It was really kind of interesting because Arsenio was asking him about what he thought of one of the other action guys 
 God I can't even remember the name 
 He said well he wouldn't really talk about it 
 Didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a good action guy
 It wasn't Stallone 
 it was 
 I can't remember 
 Shoot I can't remember the guys name 
 But I like all the RAMBO movies
 Yeah
 Yo Adrian <>
 No 
 we actually rent probably a good combination of movies with the exception of horror films
 Don't watch really very many horror films at all
 You know I don't know 
 there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you or something you know coming out of the T V that just doesn't make my day you know
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 I just saw a really interesting movie called FLATLINERS
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It was just crazy enough for th- 
 you know students might try to do it 
 You know and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it
 Yeah
 Yeah
 yeah 
 that was a great movie
 Yeah 
 have you seen SHRIMP ON THE BARBY 
 yeah 
 it's got 
 No
 No
 Hogan
 No
 no 
 it's got Cheech Marin 
 Yeah 
 it is 
 it's kind of a poor man's PRETTY WOMAN in reverse
 But it was kind of cute 
 Actually did you see DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS
 I though that was a really cute movie 
 I enjoyed that 
 No 
 I haven't
 I hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video 
 Yeah 
 Well my wife has got a picture from Kevin Costner 
 and he signed it 
 It's from DANCES WITH WOLVES
 Yeah 
 and he signed it 
 he happens to be a friend of one of her business associates or not a friend a cousin 
 So but anyhow we got a nice picture 
 and it came in an envelope that says DANCES WITH WOLVES 
 so we've got to try to get out there and see that one
 
 Now did you see DRIVING MISS DAISY
 Okay
