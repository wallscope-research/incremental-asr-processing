 Your family have reunions on a regular basis
 Once every five years
 Yeah 
 you have got a pretty big family
 yeah
 Yeah 
 we have a pretty big family 
 but most of us 
 well I am originally from West Virginia
 Most of the family is right in the West Virginia what they call Tri-State area northern West Virginia eastern Ohio southwestern Pennsylvania
 Most everybody is right in that area
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 They put one together for our family about once every June 
 It was on my grandmother's birthday 
 but she is gone now
 Yeah 
 
 Oh
 Pardon
 Well no 
 There is kind of a set pattern to it 
 There is 
 so the day it happens is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually
 Yeah 
 we get together at the park and playground area of the Church I was raised in
 and everybody brings lots of food 
 and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat 
 gosh
 Yeah
 Schedule vacation time 
 and yeah 
 We usu- 
 Sunday afternoon or sometimes it has been like on a Saturday afternoon 
 Usually it is like Sunday afternoon 
 and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back
 Well where I am calling from is southern Mississippi 
 So we have got my wife and I have a bit longer ways to go than most
 actually we have only made one of them since we got married about four years ago One of the family reunions 
 But we are both in school 
 so that makes it kind of tough
 they have been happening just after the summer semester starts
 Usually not 
 We managed to get to one 
 That was before I started school 
 and she took that summer off 
 But 
 goodness 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I understand 
 Where is home for you
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well maybe this year you can find a more central location
 okay 
 Then the majority of them are still in the Missouri area
 Okay 
 You know our family right now the most of it there is only a few stragglers with any distance 
 There is one cousin out in Colorado some cousins over in Phoenix 
 I got a sister over in Washington State 
 the rest of them are within you know a couple hours drive
 That is pretty much it 
 Yeah 
 It is going to be such and such weekend 
 and you all come
 That is about it 
 And you know this is the standard pattern 
 It 
 everybody brings their favorite dish 
 and somebody brings the volleyball net 
 somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon 
 and 
 Am I related to you
 Yeah 
 I married your cousin's brother's uncle or something like that
 yeah 
 every year
 And still you wind up meeting people you never knew you were related to Let alone
 And 
 yeah
