 I don't know 
 My personal perception of government and the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted 
 And I don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to be self-serving to the community 
 I think that they have their own wishes to be in the limelight and to kind of say hey you know I'm a public official I don't have to do certain things 
 and they just stand out more Involving themselves more and more with politics 
 but it's really 
 after all the things that I've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts of checks before that it was the wonderful escapade that they had with the new God chief of 
 well Supreme Court 
 I'm trying to think of his name and what they put him through in regards to 
 Yeah 
 Thomas
 The sexual harassment that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that 
 I just think it's very corrupt and <> whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor and send them into government versus people that are rich 
 But it's always the rich person that gets into government That has the money to advertise the money to do this 
 There's no more Abraham Lincolns out there that can get into government even if they were poor 
 So I know that's my personal viewpoint of things
 Now they've already put through the health bill 
 Yes 
 It just went through 
 and it was passed 
 and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical 
 I don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people 
 You know what I'm saying 
 it's 
 right now every little state around here is thinking about we need to reform the health system 
 and of course they think Minnesota our neighbor passed a state law the health bill 
 and it's kind of like we're the first to do it 
 So I don't know if it's done because we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for you know a real good purpose to help people that can't afford health insurance that kind of thing 
 Uh-huh 
 sure 
 sure
 Uh-huh
 it sure does 
 And I think it is reflecting 
 Like you said I think society as a whole you can't expect 
 when we have T Vs and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for you know immorality and this and this and this that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be totally clean And come into government 
 but down the line it does hurt 
 when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something you know it does hurt each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or you know the other things that have occurred 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Exactly 
 Yeah 
 Well that's exactly what happens in government all the time 
 They blow the whistle on each other 
 I hear that you're doing this 
 I've done it 
 but boy 
 and it's not going to get out 
 Ex- 
 yeah 
 exactly It's 
 there's no secrets in the government I don't think anymore
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 sure 
 [ I don't think
