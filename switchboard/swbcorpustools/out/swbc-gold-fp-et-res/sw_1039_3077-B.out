 Okay
 I guess so 
 go by ear
 Okay
 Right
 wow
 we have a six percent sales tax
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 I don't mind my taxes as much as my social security
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 the taxes 
 I don't know 
 I can deal with that because I know everyone else is paying in too I guess you know
 But I don't know 
 the one thing that 
 we don't have tax on clothes do you
 That's what I thought 
 I know New York also has a sales tax on clothes
 and I know a lot of kids like going to college with me that lived in New York or out of state a lot of them would buy their clothes in Pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that
 Uh-huh
 No 
 well we don't have it necessarily on food 
 but then there's other things that they nail you for it like health and beauty products you know
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that 
 Deduct yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And see 
 I take it she was an accountant
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 I know 
 well I also was a student 
 I just graduated in May
 and I graduated with a finance degree 
 but that was the big joke the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax 
 That was the big joke
 Clarion University
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I think they should go back 
 I realize you know that we have graduated tax brackets 
 but I think they should still go back 
 and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class I think the burden should be put more on the wealthy
 Yeah 
 yeah
 you know they always have the argument Well you know well who's to say we don't work harder to get that you know 
 well I don't care how much they take off of you you know
 you're still going to be above on top 
 and I 
 you now 
 like you said I've worked in different places 
 and the ones that get the most pay do the least work
 Uh-huh
 I agree with you 
 I do think it's a lot of luck 
 and I don't like that part of the finance you know whatsoever
 I don't know 
 but like what I was saying about the social security that's real you know 
 it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes
 and then the more I think about it the more I think I'm paying in to something that I 
 granted you know I'm paying for my grandparents
 but I'm never going to see that
 Social Security is going to be gone before I ever get any
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 they're going to pay me fifty dollars a month right 
 I'm sorry 
 I put in much more than that you know
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 you got to look to what they put you know 
 you have decent roads at least 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's true
 Uh-huh 
 it's how you look at it too
 I like to 
 instead of thinking how much you know that I'm paying out I like to just look at it and say well everyone else is doing it too you know
