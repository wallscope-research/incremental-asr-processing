 Hello
 Hi 
 my name is Leslie
 And where are you from
 nice 
 I'm from Dallas Texas
 Yeah 
 so 
 Well did you understand you know what it was for what we 
 Yeah 
 Okay 
 I don't watch too many 
 but we can try it
 Are you ready to start
 Okay 
 just a minute 
 Yeah 
 okay
 Well I don't really watch too many T V shows other than occasionally I'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here
 so if there's no one else around you know it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something I'll turn that on but just for the conversation factor I think 
 and then I think I enjoy when I catch it I don't even know what night it's on but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes
 Yeah 
 do you 
 Yeah 
 it's fun 
 And then there's a new one that started out that I've caught a couple of times called GOOD AND EVIL I think
 really
 It is a real different one 
 it's different 
 I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it
 But 
 No 
 I haven't watched that
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Sounds neat
 Yeah 
 Is that on what station 
 okay 
 What other shows do you like
 yeah
 Well she comes on later 
 and I usually have kids around so I don't end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it I guess
 Yeah 
 That's right 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 That can happen 
 So do you know of any other shows in the even or something that you enjoy
 that's always fun
 Yeah
 uh-huh
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well I think 
 I also course like to catch the news during the evening hours
 but it's a little tough because that's when I'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time
 So usually I don't get a whole lot of news watching in
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 So what have you seen interesting on OPRAH WINFREY lately
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well I don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not 
 that's right
 yeah
 It is interesting 
 So 
 No 
 no 
 just doing this as a fund-raiser for our church
 Yeah 
 so it kind of makes it easy you know to do a little something for it
