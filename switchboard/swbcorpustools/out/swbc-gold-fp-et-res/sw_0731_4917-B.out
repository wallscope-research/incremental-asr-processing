 Yes
 The type of cars that I would be most interested in if I was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a Mazda Miata
 the 
 I'm very much a fan of sports cars
 The 
 The 
 though actually in som- 
 actually if I h- 
 I have av- 
 I've avoided buying a new car for quite some time/
 I'd rather put my money into restoring my old cars 
 I have a old Triumph T R Six
 And so 
 but if I was to buy one probably something like a Miata 
 It's certainly 
 i- 
 I wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time 
 Yeah 
 well I have a nineteen eighty-five C R X
 which is you know it's 
 it still works fine 
 But actually it's kind of annoying cause I've got no reason to replace it /
 But those are 
 they're about thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and you know a bit more if you add some some options and so on 
 but the 
 yeah 
 that's a pretty good price 
 and [ they're so nice to drive
 it's nice 
 They're 
 I've been down to a dealer and driven them 
 And I've also driven one at something Mazda put on where they went to autocross events across the country which is where you race in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of cones to see who can get through the fastest
 you know about a minute or so And very twisty stuff 
 And it handles so nicely
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It was just 
 it's just so smooth 
 and 
 Yeah 
 Nice car 
 What are you interested in
 Yeah 
 you don't get involved in car decisions 
 Yeah 
 I can understand 
 Well would *[[slash error should be qw]] you want if you had to decide what would you want Okay 
 *[[slash error should be bk]] yeah 
 They're nice 
 yeah 
 That's perfect for that
 It's not 
 it's small enough that it's easy to drive
 Holds a lot 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 Minivans are nice 
 I have a friend who has a minivan
 And I've driven it a few times 
 and it's nice 
 it's nice 
 Of course you know my family has always had cars like that in that you know my father's always had a V W bus every since about nineteen sixty or so
 
 they well 
 he used it 
 he often has to transport <> plants or things like that cause he goes to orchid shows and you know fills the car with plants And so on 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 And they're not that expensive
 Yeah
 Mainly because everyone makes them you know 
 You can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be
 Uh-huh 
 <> Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Minivans do pretty well You know twenty twenty-five miles per gallon or more
 Some of them probably even do thirty
 The 
 yeah 
 there's some other cars I'd like 
 but I would never be willing to send quite that much money for like 
 I'll drool over them
