 Good morning 
 okay 
 go ahead
 Yeah 
 I understand the topic this morning is our policy in Latin America and you know what we've been doing down there 
 So as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area 
 it just so happens that our daughter-in-law is Panamanian 
 and we have been in Panama 
 and I have worked in El Salvador 
 and we visit Mexico occasionally 
 so yeah 
 we do have a little information on it here 
 but 
 uh-huh
 <>
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit 
 that's for sure 
 No 
 I 
 the U S policy towards Central America as far as 
 well I kind of go back to the El Salvador thing because Texas Instruments had a plant down there for a while 
 and I worked in there for a little while 
 and at that particular time 
 let's see 
 that was seventy-three seventy-four kind of before the the Civil War really picked up down there 
 and U S policy at that particular time there was of course military assistance to the government itself you know 
 anything that's anti-Communist you know we kind of had a tendency to be pro 
 It don't matter what their excesses were 
 and I believe at the time that I was down there that the Salvadorian government you know really gotten out of hand yet 
 the right wing death squad type situation 
 I believe that that was beginning to form 
 but I wasn't really aware of it's being you know terribly you know at the time that I was down there 
 I think that really kind of developed a little bit later on 
 but our policies seem to be pretty much one of you know trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource anyway that Salvador had 
 [ plenty of + and that was people
 We didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's labor
 because everything that T I did anyway we shipped in 
 and it was worked on down there assembled and then sent back here 
 so 
 I didn't feel that we really exploiting them any
 No 
 in the particular incidence that I was aware of now T I wasn't the only ones in there 
 Playtex was in 
 there was several other companies
 and of course we kind of concentrate on 
 there wasn't much to take out of the country 
 I felt like we're going in and taken all their gold or oil or bananas or coffee or anything like that 
 because it just 
 the only thing that they had a great abundance of was you know human beings 
 and 
 Yeah 
 I understand what you say 
 There was a 
 the time that I was down there I stayed quite a bit at one of the big hotels San Salvador 
 And at the time I thought there ought to be a law against American tourists Because they for the most part tend to be the most obnoxious as a group 
 and I saw this in Panama also
 you know it's the almost stereotype you know 
 flowery shirt shorts camera hanging around their neck you know demanding this that and the other thing you know 
 we're here 
 and we want this 
 and we want that 
 and that sort of thing 
 that's the stereotype that's very strong down there you know 
 you know that sort of thing 
 I believe those of us who were working down there got a little bit more appreciation for you know the local culture 
 I really don't believe that we were quite that bad 
 but yet they were having to deal directly you know with the local people
 but boy 
 there is you know the old brash or ugly American-type situation 
 And I saw incidences in the hotel where I just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say my God 
 those are not Americans 
 they can't be
 But there are 
 and of course now I remember one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad 
 but I think it's just kind of the North American situation 
 In Panama they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long 
 but I didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing as Panamanians are just about as as Americans as far as creature comforts you know 
 they're every bit 
 I know when my son was in the Air Force 
 and he was stationed in Panama 
 and he married a Panamanian girl 
 and when she came up here you know 
 except for the language situation some of the cultures she's just about an American you know as far as T V and you know the moneymaking part of it and all that 
 matter of fact if anything she's worse
 But there's little enclaves down there where you know Americans have a lot of influence 
 and the local population kind of you know sort of accepts that 
 but I've also seen the other side of it too
 Well you were in Peru
 Uh-huh <>
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh <> 
 what area did you live in
 okay 
 yeah
 I've heard of it
 Well is Peace Corps still active down in there
 Uh-huh
 has those influences lasted 
 do you know whether the things that you and your groups before you did did those live on 
 or were they reabsorbed 
 or how 
 Uh-huh <>
 Uh-huh
 Well that was kind of the aim wasn't it to get it started and then have it taken up by the 
 okay 
 so you know well that's 
 I had wondered sometimes 
 I knew that there was a lot of effort 
 and a lot of work went into a lot of that 
 and I just wondered if it lasted and if it took you know 
 like r- 
 Uh-huh <>
 Oh
 Yeah 
 my brother-in-law teaches at Northern Illinois University 
 and they were in China here a couple of years ago 
 and he was over there at the University of Shah and teaching
