 What kind h- 
 Right now we I've got a uh four year old Subaru and a two year old Honda
 Oh goodness
 Really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I bet
 I bet
 Yep
 
 Uh-huh 
 No 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well yeah 
 we had uh we had 
 these are the first cars that my husband and I have ever purchased ourselves
 The others were hand me downs through the families
 And those were always G M cars
 Uh Buicks and Chevrolets
 And uh we were real happy with them 
 but all the ones that we ever had were the you know eight cylinder
 really rugged G M cars
 And all we had heard was was a lot of negative press about the smaller cars 
 and we both drive well forty-five miles round trip every day
 And so we wanted a smaller car
 when we got ready to buy we needed a smaller car to get better gas mileage 
 and quite frankly we were afraid of the of the G M small cars
 You know as far as durability
 So we kind of 
 when we had our larger cars we didn't mind uh keeping them up
 you know doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often
 But once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them all of them you know 
 it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them 
 Yeah 
 it 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 It's like a yacht
 Yeah 
 What 
 we we sold or we we traded in our Le Sabre for our Subaru
 Yeah 
 it was a great car
 It just 
 we ran the wheels right off of it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 I bet 
 No
 I wouldn't want to have to pay for the gas either
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 No time soon 
 Uh we're our our we won't have any more licensed drivers for about thirteen years
 
 Yes
 So we uh so we don't plan on purchasing any more any time soon 
 Both of our cars are getting oh around sixty thousand miles on them
 We drive a lot
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 A pickup {faint}
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Uh-huh
 I think that would be a good idea
 Yeah 
 I've we've we've we've kind of been the types that will say this is what we intend to spend
 this is the car we want 
 will you sell me this car for that price
 And and we've had 
 we with our 
 when we bought our Subaru the guy was like you can't do this to me 
 and we're were just like okay fine we we won't then
 You know 
 I mean he's like no no no
 But 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Goodness
 That's right
