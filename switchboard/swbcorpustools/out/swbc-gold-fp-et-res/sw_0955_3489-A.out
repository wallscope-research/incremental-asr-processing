 Okay Jerry 
 I guess tonight's topic is about recycling
 And I'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community here in Plano 
 Right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the collection agency or the city along with your garbage can 
 you can put out newspaper 
 you can put out glass 
 you can put out aluminum cans 
 you can put out certain types of plastic material 
 and that is on a roll out effort right now 
 Not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and participate right now 
 but that will be rolled out to everyone I hope in the next year or so 
 And those that aren't participating they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum 
 And I think overall that's an excellent opportunity 
 because I hate to see our landfills being filled up and growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for not only the people that are living today but for the future also 
 So 
 How about your community
 Dye Mound
 Uh-huh
 Sounds like a place where I grew up 
 Well I like it 
 Uh-huh
 Well good
 okay
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Well let's hope not 
 You can get in trouble for that
 Uh-huh
 Well it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack isn't it
 Okay 
 okay
 Yes 
 until you release it
 All right
 I think 
 Yes
 yes 
 I sure do
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Yes
 No
 Well great 
 That's excellent
 Well if a lot of people did that then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail 
 That's a great idea 
 I hadn't thought about that 
 and we might be able to incorporate some of that 
 One thing 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh
 Yes
 Well that's a great idea 
 that's a great idea
 Products
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 they will
 Exactly
 
 Well that's a full time job
 Yes 
 well I've found out too that you know a couple years ago 
 we've always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years 
 and at one time we could get a pretty good return with the Boy Scouts 
 We could take and collect the newspaper
