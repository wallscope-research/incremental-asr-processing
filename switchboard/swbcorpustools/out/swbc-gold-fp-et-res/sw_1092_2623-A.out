 Okay 
 I'll let you go ahead 
 uh-huh
 Oh
 That's great 
 I always thought it'd be great to have twins
 Well yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Your first ones you mean it was this way
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 That's difficult
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 It happens that way 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh
 Texas is much worst for the drugs 
 it was bad enough every place else 
 but drugs in Texas are extremely bad
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's all you can do
 Well I was going to ask too does your wife work
 Uh-huh
 She just recently started working then
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 So that sounds great 
 Well we also have five children
 And but ours are all out of the nest 
 So when they were growing up probably we had a lot of similar things like you had you know having the time 
 When you have younger ones to take care of you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones
 But we're very active of course at church and Boy Scouting and Girl Scouts Four H 
 and those activities helped a lot in giving us things to do with the children 
 And we try to take a vacation with them every year camping of some sort something that wasn't expensive 
 And our youngest is expecting her first baby 
 So they're all out and on their own 
 They're 
 and we have one to get married yet 
 And they'll all be married 
 and they're all doing pretty good 
 They 
 T lives in Pittsburgh you probably don't know where that is
 Okay 
 Two of our children live there 
 one like I said lives in around Maryland D C 
 He works right on the border of D C
 And one lives in Connecticut <> 
 and our baby lives just a mile over the hill so we'll get to see her a little more than what we do the other ones
 Uh-huh 
 Well they have to
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 To go to follow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 And that does make a big difference
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 that's 
 well none of us are 
 Let's face it you know we're not none of us like they portray it on those shows 
 life's much more difficult than that
 And 
 Right 
 Right
 Now our daughter well she's our second oldest she's the only other one that has children 
 She has two boys 
 And she works full time 
 and I have mixed feelings about that 
 She's able to do that 
 and I don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home 
 But yet on the other hand I've got the mixed feelings that I think you should be at home with your children 
 I'm kind of old fashioned I guess that way
 But they seem to give quality time to those children when they are together 
 and so it seems for them that it works out all right 
 So I don't know 
 I don't think I ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family 
 So I 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 It does it 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 What line of work are you in now since you went to school 
 and *[[slash error]] okay
 Okay 
 A lot of the people I've talked to work for for the same
 
 Uh-huh
 Which your income would be a lot better now
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 And it's kind of a waste of a person
 You know 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And you recognized this and was able to you know do something about it
 Uh-huh
 Well it puts a strain on everybody your wife and your family
 And the only thing you can remember is to <> try and stay together as much as you can because it's very easy to go your own direction when you're working so hard and going to school too
 Well that's wonderful
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 It sounds to me like you're doing well 
 My husband's retired 
 so he's been retired for three years now
 Yeah 
 That's quite a change
 well he made it at fifty 
 It was a magic number for him 
 and he went at fifty 
 and he still works part time at other thing you know same job as he was doing only he's retired and doing it independently
 But nevertheless retired
