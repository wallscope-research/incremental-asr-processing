 Yeah 
 I read an interesting article in the paper that discussed that 
 seemed that every other time a President tried to get support for an action like President Carter and his thing with the hostage crisis he always did it through rhetoric
 And this time President Bush did it through action 
 and he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support
 or he left almost no alternative
 and it was very interesting how he did it 
 and I'm an Air Force Officer 
 so it was interesting for me you know 
 I'd certainly 
 I think it's great that all the support 
 I have friends of mine from the Air 
 I'm an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory
 but other guys here on base 
 this is a B fifty-two base where I work 
 so we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there 
 and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it
 Yes 
 it was
 Yeah 
 I don't know the exact figure 
 but I would imagine that because of how close the vote was almost certainly would have to be 
 Just based on the disparity of Democrats and Republicans in Congress he'd think that it would have to have been 
 And I 
 gosh this whole thing now with all the political cartoons on the Democrats and how they're in a sad way for ninety-two now in terms of the presidential election anyway
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Right 
 right 
 I think that was 
 all those factors played a part in you know the 
 everyone was discussing whether we should wait longer 
 but I know that there's a lot of reasons to wait longer 
 but I think we were genuinely concerned about their military capability 
 and I think we over estimated it 
 but still we were really highly concerned about it 
 and we were worried that they were getting dug in 
 and 
 Yeah
 Right 
 they couldn't 
 yeah 
 it's true 
 they 
 Saddam thought he had the whole thing figured out to which way we were coming and what our doctrine was 
 That's right 
 that's true 
 That's interesting 
 I think this political situation over there now is 
 it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether this opposition will 
 today the Turks agreed to support the Kurds which is something they've never done before 
 [ and + *[[needs slash]] And ] this 
 *[[%]] the Arabs all of a sudden are cheering for Baker on his drive to reconcile relations with the Israelis 
 so it's like 
 Yeah 
 I 
 No 
 I think I did hear that at one time a long time ago
 because I used to live in Massachusetts 
 but 
 Yeah 
 New Hampshire
 my gosh
 
 Well I don't 
 yeah 
 I'd certainly support Israel in their policy in defending themselves and in their handling of their foreign policy 
 I think the stand they have or the way the command respect I support that 
 I think that is a positive thing for them after thousands of years 
 they ha- 
 I think they in 
 when they became a country they more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore 
 and 
 Yeah 
 exactly exactly 
 and so gee 
 I lost my train of thought here 
 so okay 
 so I can't say whether that I'm pro Israel or anti Israel 
 I'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region 
 and looks that the joining of forces for this Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing
 Right
 Yeah 
 somebody's going to 
 and I think that's the problem the P L O has is that whenever one group of them decides that they're going to negotiate or they're going to do something they're going to try to make some peace the end result is that there so many factions of them some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or they split 
 they end up becoming divisive themselves
 I 
 it's interesting
 I'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months 
 but that's 
 Yeah 
 I know 
 that's absolutely unprecedented 
 that was an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the President and the State Department
 And that's never happened before
 and I don't know if it will ever happen again 
 but 
 Yeah 
 okay 
 I guess well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time
 All right
 Bye bye
