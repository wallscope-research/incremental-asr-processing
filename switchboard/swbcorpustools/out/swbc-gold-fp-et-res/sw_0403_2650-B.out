 no
 I bet
 I guess so 
 Have you lost him before
 Uh-huh
 What kind of a dog is he
 Yeah
 Oh
 boy he's a big one
 Yeah
 well I hope he comes back 
 that's too bad
 How long have you had him
 that's tough
 Yeah 
 you get very attached to animals don't you
 Yeah
 Well you know they're always there for you 
 and they don't talk back to you 
 And it's kind of pleasant
 Yeah 
 sure 
 sure
 Yes 
 we have a dog a little white Lhasa 
 And her name is Angel 
 And we have a cat a white cat he's just a Tabby just a 
 and his name is Dominique 
 We call him Neek
 But 
 Pretty good 
 we had the dog first 
 and she's kind of a wimp 
 and the cat kind of rules 
 but she likes him all right 
 we had another cat about two years ago 
 It got feline leukemia so we had to have it put to sleep 
 and then we got this new cat 
 so I have two children 
 and they really enjoy the animals 
 And then my mother who's very elderly lives with us 
 and she's really good friends with the dog 
 They're very good buddies
 That's right
 That's right 
 They don't care what you look like or what you act like
 They just love you unconditionally
 It's wonderful
 I know it has to be
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Oh
 that's really too bad 
 that's awful well
 Well I hope you'll find him 
 You most likely will
 Well have you put any posters up or anything like that
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 yeah
 No 
 you sure can't
 dear
 Well that's good
 They can keep their eyes open 
 yeah
 That will help 
 Well 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 he will 
 I bet he does
 I know that it's hard on you 
 I know that I'd be worried too
 Yeah 
 isn't it though
 That's 
 You know I know sometimes our cat will stay out all night 
 and when he's not right at the door in the morning I really worry that something's happened to him that he's got in a fight or you know somebody's hit him 
 and if he doesn't come by mid morning then I really get scared 
 But he's always come back eventually 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 they can
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well but he's a real feisty guy 
 He fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property
 He's 
 cats are really almost more territorial than dogs are 
 They just really do not want other animals on their property 
 They're very 
 he just 
 any cat that comes near and even a dog he won't jump at them or anything 
 but he'll sit 
 and he'll watch 
 and I think maybe he would if it came real close 
 but he's very protective of our property
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well they're really a lot different than dogs because they're very independent 
 and he's very affectionate when he wants to be 
 but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be he'll you know either scratch you or run away
 But when he wants to be he's really affectionate 
 He likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and snuggle up to you 
 but if he's not in the mood you'd better stay away from him
 But dogs seem to be always in the mood 
 They're always you know right there and like you to pet them and loving
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 they do
 They sure do
 Yeah
 Now do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outs-
 You have a fenced yard or 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well how did he get out
 boy
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well you know that animals are like that 
 They like to roam and investigate And see what's going on
 No
 No 
 I'm sure that yeah 
 Yeah
 How are your kids handling it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 that sounds like kids
 Oh
 What's his name 
 did you call
 Buddy
 that's was our cat's name that died
 yeah 
 we named him Buddy after Buddy Bell the Ranger baseball player that used to be here
 And we used to 
 we were really into that when we got him going to the Ranger games 
 and we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason
 But Buddy after Buddy Bell 
 so 
 But he was a good cat too 
 We miss him a lot
 and I feel real guilty because we had him like for six years 
 and one year I forgot to get him his leukemia booster 
 and he got it
 And I just felt so bad 
 it's real contagious 
 and it's 
 and the vet said it runs rampant in this area 
 and if they don't have their booster any kind of saliva or anything from another cat if they get in a fight it automatically like 
 they get it if the other cat has it 
 so 
 Oh
 Oh 
 It was 
 I just felt terrible 
 I knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was 
 he was just getting real skinny <>
