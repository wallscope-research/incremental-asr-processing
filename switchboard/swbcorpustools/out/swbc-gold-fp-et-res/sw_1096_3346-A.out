 Okay 
 you want to tell me first how you feel about the proposal
 Uh-huh
 The boys
 not the girls the boys
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I thought it would be good too 
 but I did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps because not all young people would have what it takes to go like that because I think it takes a certain person to be able to do something like that 
 but there's a lot of other public service things that could be done
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Yes 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I think it would be that 
 When they say this proposal is this something that they're just suggesting 
 or are they actually 
 why did they call it a proposal 
 that 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's what I wondered
 It'd be good character builder
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well people that have received sentences in jail they have to go out and do public service activities which to me is good
 Uh-huh
 Well I think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like you know what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood some of the people how they live 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 because that's one thing that's hard with young people you can't tell them how things are
 they have to see for themselves
 now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years 
 I don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction you know their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go and something 
 course now Peace Corps that couldn't be done of course until they were done with school so *[[should this be it's own slash unit]]/
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Kind of an in-between time
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 No 
 and like I said now all young people should be able to do something 
 but not all certainly would be geared to even the Mormon boys that go out not all of them go 
 it's disaster if they don't go 
 but some of them are not 
 they're just not made to do that type of thing
 and they just aren't able to do it
