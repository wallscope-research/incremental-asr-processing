 Yes
 I actually get most of my news coverage off computer networks 
 However I do also watch television news usually in the morning once a day 
 and I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL most every day
 well DOW JONES for example cause the news wire 
 and it's picked up and actually available at my office 
 so it's no fee or subscription either to read at my leisure 
 and it's sort of by category 
 For example so I can read a certain business or topics
 Well it's similar to that 
 but it's DOW JONES which is the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire
 well actually not 
 I do follow 
 I don't know how to describe it 
 so I'll say a religious newspaper which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense 
 It's a weekly but not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things 
 I'd like to say however that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires 
 I think that it has to do with 
 I personally think 
 I have a problem with their viewpoint 
 and I personally think there's a strong bias in the media
 Yeah 
 Absolutely 
 after all who writes 
 People who are journalist who are trained to write 
 and that's a liberal field at least from academia 
 and the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in I find their descriptions to be wrong
 and it 
 That's right 
 Well even if it's not technical If it's some social thing or whatever It doesn't matter 
 If I am an expert in it they usually make mistakes which makes me think I'm not expert in it 
 They're telling me lies
 I think both 
 by deliberate I mean mistakes of omission or biased toward a particular liberal view point that they have
 So to give you an example we will go out of the printing media 
 I know of cases where we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you Which is sort of like a deliberate bias which is rather disturbing 
 he does that 
 Yeah 
 I don't have access either Although I did at one time 
 and it was 
 I did during the Gulf War 
 and it was addictive 
 Yeah 
 well during that small sample I would think that everyone was just about the same except the three networks radio television programming
 So if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by turning on C N N 
 and you
