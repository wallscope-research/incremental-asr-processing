 music do you like 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I am more into rock and roll myself
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh Uh-huh
 Do you like any bluegrass
 Oh
 Well at least your 
 Not really 
 Yeah
 
 we'll have to 
 I have a lot of friends that like country music 
 No 
 I'm more into older rock like the psychedelic era like 
 late sixties seventies 
 Greatful Dead Crosby Stills and Nash
 What 
 I've heard a little bit of it 
 I've just 
 now I've heard of Striper 
 So the only one I can 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 the first of Amy Grant before 
 you know became more mainstream top forty 
 Uh-huh
 
 I've never actually seen her in concert 
 I imagine that she puts on a pretty good show
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh <> 
 I like some country music 
 It's just that I like finding a lot of it's 
 Yeah 
 Mama got run over by the train
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Like Garth Brooks 
 Reba MacIntyre 
 You don't like Patsy Cline 
 You don't like Patsy Cline
 yeah 
 actually I just went to see the Greatful Dead I guess about a week ago
 No 
 they are still on tour 
 They have been touring since the late sixties 
 No
 They're still together 
 They're still making albums
 Uh-huh
 
 In fact there are people you know that basically just follow them around from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that 
 
 Yeah 
 they're like late forties early fifties 
 but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement 
 You know they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players 
 They keep on dying 
 and they keep on replacing them 
 and the new ones in this thirties you know 
 But 
 Yeah 
 <> Well they don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones 
 They just 
 I don't know if you saw the tour posters of the Rolling Stones when they last toured 
 but it looked like leather day at the geriatric
 All their faces were just all shriveled
 Uh-huh
 it just just looked like they got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans
 Well 
 Actually I prefer my performers to be pretty sober you know just so if they're jamming you know that they don't just lose themselves and you know go into lala land
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 So have you seen any concerts lately
