 Normally I listen to C N N or HEADLINE NEWS about an hour a day 
 and then I supplement that with radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week and a newspaper if I have time
 That's true 
 and how do you rate the 
 are you pleased with the news coverage that you're receiving
 On the whole I'm pleased when I have an opportunity to hear just the facts 
 I would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves since I don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite
 I think I'm fed up with trite 
 There seems to be more and more of it 
 and I understand the void that comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations 
 and as expensive as they are to produce they certainly don't want any dead airspace
 we're certainly in agreement there
 Radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done 
 maybe they're a little more efficient or have more to do over that same time frame
 I don't know which that answer is 
 I think my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like SIXTY MINUTES 
 Do you watch that
 Well I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES until they did two programs that I knew both the people and the incidences 
 and I knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint that was in my estimate nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings
 And it ever since that time I just don't watch 
 so I guess we have the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not
 I don't know how old you are 
 but it seems to me like the last newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that I wanted to hear was Walter Cronkite
 So I don't know if you're familiar with him or not
 Well Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold of Cronkite 
 and he did a pretty good job 
 THE HUNTLEY BRINKLEY REPORT was quite excellent over the years
 Well once they've reported the facts all they can offer is an opinion anymore
 Well I almost felt like it was too much 
 Indeed I found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening
 I spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst
 and I don't need their fill-ins you know 
 Yes 
 but I think it helps me everyday in trying to review the state that the world is in and try to guess where we're going
 Well I think my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES
 I like U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT 
 At one time or another I've taken them all for a year
 I believe in giving anything a chance
 but I keep coming back to that one 
 so that's kind of my favorite
 It's primarily a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports
 here's what went on in Asia over the past week 
 and there's maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs unless that was the focus of their main stories
 it too is one those 
 in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways 
 and I do most of my reading in the bathroom
 and it's one of those that I can read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that I'm going to spend in there
 And it just seems to fit nicely so that I can get it read in about three days
 Well to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway
 Well anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt
 I'm with you 
 I have to check T NEWS everyday 
 It's my noontime dose of facts
 No
 
 Well it does sound very interesting
 maybe our phone company out here will get around to offering something like that
