 I've had three boys through I guess some child care each one of them 
 and now they're in school 
 so it's all over 
 but I guess I would say it's not easy to find what most parents would want
 Is that right 
 I guess the only rule I can think of is that I like to look for places with good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that 
 If they're associated with a college or a university they're usually a pretty good bet
 I think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something 
 You'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care
 Yeah 
 For profit places I would really look at them awfully carefully 
 but when my kids were young I was teaching at a university 
 and the child care center associated with our university was quite good 
 so I felt confident that they'd do right 
 you mean learning type yeah actual experiments they would have to get your permission 
 But yeah 
 I suppose if there is a psychology department or an education department around you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another 
 I guess that's true 
 But I never had bad experience in that respect 
 Of course you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents 
 and they you know 
 pretty good people 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I never really worry very much about it 
 I tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public 
 so I never really worried too much about that the case with my boys
 you know I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them 
 but 
 I don't think it's as common as the newspapers would make you believe 
 yeah 
 I mean that
 Right
 Well in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were in school 
 And I'm really happy we did it although it was very very difficult 
 And I think it was the right thing to do 
 and we just decided that we would do it 
 and we went ahead 
 but not everybody can make that choice 
 and even though my wife wasn't working we did have one or another of the boys in child care just for part of the day or a couple of days a week just so that other things could get done around the house and so on 
 So we did look around 
 I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not 
 so I would always trust her judgment on that
 Uh-huh
 There's absolutely no question that you're going to be the best child care provider for that kid 
 so yeah do it as long you can 
 But I think you know you have to look through a place 
 and you have to get a feel for how they treat the kids and what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them 
 And the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open That you're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth 
 and if they're at all queasy about that then I'd look elsewhere yeah 
 Right 
 You have other friends that have kids being taken care of in child care
 Uh-huh 
 But I really think the news reports tend to sensationalize the problems
 I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and pay and exhaustion and you know things like that rather than these really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy
 Yeah
 Uh-huh Well
