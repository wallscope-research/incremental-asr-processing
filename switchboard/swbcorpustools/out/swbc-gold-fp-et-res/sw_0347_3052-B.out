 Okay 
 well the topic is selecting care for the elderly
 And I don't have elderly parents yet but not that far in the distant future 
 What about yourself
 A concern of yours right now
 are they living independently right now
 Oh
 Have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that
 that sounds the ultimate
 Well even at that point most care can be given in the home 
 That sound like just an excellent solution 
 You must feel real good about that
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Really in need of a nursing home
 Right 
 uh-huh
 Well it's you know 
 I think we just you know listen to the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes 
 It's just a matter of finding a good home
 and then of course there is always the problem of being able to afford either of those solutions
 And that I think is what is scary 
 and I also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from Is when people have to put people in a nursing homes 
 and they really can not afford the best
 Oh
 goodness
 Oh
 What a shame 
 they put him in the home so that he could be cared for
 and then they could have done that well at home 
 Oh
 You hear these stories all the time
 You happened 
 Right
 Oh
 Right
 Well good
 Good 
 I'm glad they have a solution To do that 
 yes 
 I know 
 Exactly 
 my ex-husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for it must be seven eight years 
 and It's just her condition deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home
 As the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from people who have been independent all their lives 
 Like this was a really neat vital woman 
 and you get in a nursing home 
 and the first thing that happens you have to share your whole living space with someone that you have never known before in your life 
 And oh I do not know what the answer is 
 but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there 
 and I think it does 
 a lot of it goes down to just money And family support 
 if you you know have family that you can live with 
 Right
 Right 
 I really 
 I think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care you know 
 You would do your research 
 and you would go visit 
 And hopefully they would have it so that you could go there anytime
 Because if you could not go there anytime then that would make you a little bit su- 
 right
 Uh-huh
