 Well I'm in an urban area 
 I'm in Dallas
 And we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem even a more major problem 
 in Dallas some of the major problems 
 drugs seems to be related to quite a bit of the crime we have now 
 There is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with people trying to get money for drugs
 And I think that's a national problem though
 It's not unique
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 Well now we're pretty close to the golden triangle aren't you
 Right 
 research triangle and all of that 
 And I'm sure you have a lot of students there and a lot of researchers 
 so you may have you know perhaps a little better economic climate
 but in all your cities now it seems like there is a crowd that's really effected by this bill
 Really
 Really
 Well here I'm not sure how many Dallas has had 
 I've 
 Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four 
 I don't know 
 a number every week 
 Dallas is having quite a few 
 Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or like I say drug related 
 I guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values 
 Seems like a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to
 I 
 The economy is lousy 
 Uh-huh
 Boy that really takes someone who is bold to do that
 Well now do you find that security is very good in a town home
 Uh-huh
 Well that 
 I see
 Yeah
 Well I think you hit on one point there is you know each other
 I'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything 
 I am about three blocks off a major road and a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs 
 I guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the commercial districts 
 and I'm over the northeast part of Dallas 
 It's in a nice neighborhood 
 The houses here before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so 
 and course everything's down ten to twenty percent now
 But we have 
 one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away
 and now the economy is bad 
 they have trouble keeping those full 
 so they've dropped the 
 they're not nearly as selective as they used to be
 And course that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex 
 You start letting that happen and they go down 
 and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things 
 so I'm sure that aggravates it also
 But unemployment now in Dallas or in Texas is up around six point
