 yeah 
 I think so 
 I think I'm a little out of the ordinary in that I think I'm more worried about the national deficit than a lot of other people are and think that we need to either raise our taxes or cutback on something 
 and I don't know what to cutback on to get that settled 
 and I know I'm out of it in terms of taxes 
 so I'm think that we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do for Texas 
 and 
 Yeah 
 I think so 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 now I 
 when we moved to Richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the schools and realizing that that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to go for that because we supported the 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I think that's right
 Yeah
 I don't know about that 
 I 
 I see 
 Okay 
 No 
 Yeah 
 well that would be true 
 That would be true 
 But 
 
 Yeah 
 and even if it is isn't going to provide you with any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your home to a business for instance you know
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 And 
 Yeah 
 and the other thing is that when the public transportation is established that early on then the business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that
 Whereas in Dallas here those patterns were well established before we really tried to do the DART 
 And for instance all the office buildings and stuff that are out here in north Dallas as opposed to downtown 
 to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the metroplex to both those centers of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area You know like New York does 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Right 
 right
 Yeah
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 right
 Yep
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 A little bit much 
 yeah 
 Yep 
 Yep 
 the c- 
 Yeah 
 I think so 
 I think that will probably do it 
 so 
 Good enough
 Bye
