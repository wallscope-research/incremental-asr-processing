 right 
 well we try 
 it's a big mortgage in the sky 
 and someday maybe we might even own it 
 but for all practical purposes I guess we hold the mortgage 
 Yeah 
 right
 No one else has offered to pay for it
 Yeah 
 really they could move right into the spare room 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah
 five years ago
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it well 
 just recently I would say I would give it two years back when it was I think bottomed out
 But maybe not in your area 
 see it was just different areas
 That's a really nice area
 Besides it's not Richardson Is it 
 It's still considered Garland
 ok 
 yeah
 There you go 
 Write that one down 
 It sounded good to me 
 Right
 okay
 no
 gee
 I kept thinking of Omar Sharif every time I saw that name somewhere 
 so 
 
 wow
 Right
 great
 Well Yeah
 Probably eighty 
 Sixty eighty
 Well because I know our little house over here stuck in the middle of you know the subdivision is I think fifty five 
 so I think the high end is definitely <> you know somewhere there 
 Yeah
 Well 
 Yeah
 the ones that look like brick houses 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 I think those are awful 
 I'm sorry 
 I just don't see the designer's 
 I just see him as trying to squish you know as much house into the space as possible
 Yeah
 
 Well see that's 
 the house that we got is small enough so my husband and I 
 because there's just the two of us 
 and the two cats can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard 
 And we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Oh
 <> Yeah
 that's amazing 
 Right now in fact even as we speak we are having a deck put on in back 
 and these guys are phenomenal 
 they are doing such a terrific job back there 
 you know you pay for it too 
 but it's like really worth it 
 They are putting in a deck a redwood deck 
 and it's just they are doing such a fine fine job
 I'm really excited about it
 Uh-huh
 Great
 Yeah
 
 Looks like the George Town brownstone 
 Yeah
 Must be a dream 
 Yeah
 Oh 
 I can't 
 He has no insulation probably 
 my
 Gosh 
 What a trap 
 And you ask the right questions and can research 
 yeah
 Yeah
 I do too 
 But still it's worth it for the area and for the school and things like that <>
