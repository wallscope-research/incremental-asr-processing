 So how do you feel about the crime in your city 
 Is it 
 Uh-huh 
 really
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 San Jose California
 Here you know the real problems are the gangs
 a lot of murders just in general the whole 
 we've only been here a couple of years 
 before that we lived in Colorado 
 but in comparison to Colorado it's real noticeable
 I can just sense 
 I won't go to the grocery store at night
 You know 
 And it's that kind of thing 
 and 
 Yeah 
 We have a neighborhood watch program in the development that we live in which I think is a great way to reduce home theft burglary and things of that sort 
 Do you have that where you live 
 or 
 Uh-huh 
 no
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Well you know also I've heard that the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home Like on the weekends 
 A high percentage of free time 
 I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is spent doing yard work outdoors 
 So they wait while you're outdoors 
 They know the house is unlocked 
 and then they just slip in Slip in slip out you know 
 They know exactly what they're going for
 So I've heard that's really on the rise as far as you know a new type of crime
 Yeah 
 Unfortunately yes
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 Yeah 
 it helps to know your neighbors you know 
 They give you 
 you're supposed to make lists of cars 
 Like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development If I see a car that's unfamiliar we have a list 
 is that what you did in your program Where you have a list of license plates
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh 
 Yeah Well 
 Uh-huh
 you hate to be paranoid 
 but there are really only so many things you can do 
 You can have the house alarm neighborhood watch program you know as a woman not go out at night
 you can do that which is what I choose to do
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 That's 
 Uh-huh 
 But it's not 
 if you kill someone in your home as long as they are in your home it's considered self-defense though
 It isn't
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 Really
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well I think if you had a handgun though in other words it wasn't premeditated you had a handgun it's the middle of the night someone's down-
