 Okay Jerry
 I guess tonight's topic is about personal computers and level of interest and your expertise
 well 
 Okay 
 Well first of all 
 you want me to start off
 Okay 
 real fine 
 first of all yes 
 I do own a P C here at home 
 and I also have one at the office 
 And my level of interest is quite high with P Cs 
 and I am really interested in them however not to the extent as I was about two years ago when I basically knew about everything there was to know about different things 
 and that was the time when we were shopping for one 
 And I think we got a top of the line at that time 
 but as you know P Cs change quite rapidly 
 and the technological advances kind of outdated our P C where I can get the same P C I got two years ago at the fraction of the cost 
 And I also enjoy using ours at home 
 and we use it for a number of different things 
 Plus I get in an awful lot of good use of one at where I work 
 Lot of analytical testing reviews lot of different things I use it at work 
 so I enjoy P Cs 
 and they make my life and my work a lot easier
