 an interesting topic
 Uh-huh
 Ah 
 Boy you and my husband would have a whole lot in common 
 Uh-huh
 really
 What's the 
 how old is your car
 Oh
 Yeah 
 Right 
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 So what do the Miatas run
 Well that's not too bad
 Yeah 
 Really 
 I've never driven one
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 And so you've done this
 Oh 
 Okay
 Oh 
 Really 
 Yeah 
 <> Whatever my husband buys 
 not too much 
 No 
 we just got rid of a full conversion van that wasn't me 
 That was my husband
 He wanted a van 
 and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there T V you know the whole bit
 But I never drove it 
 so it just wasn't me you know
 And then I'd want a minivan 
 Because I'm with the kids all the time
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 And 
 Yeah 
 I pick up my little one from preschool 
 and the whole parking lot's full of minivans/
 But you know I drive a little Subaru
 And I love that 
 I 
 we were going to trade that in for the van 
 but I just wanted to hold on to it cause I just really enjoy that
 And that's really all I needed was for something just to go here and there and back 
 Uh-huh
 really 
 really
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 It's amazing what a minivan can do 
 We went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan And pulled the little trailer behind
 The pop-up trailer
 And it's 
 so it's really amazing how much a minivan can do
 No 
 they're not
 They're probably 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 And we do a lot of driving 
 We do a lot of traveling By car 
 And so that's the only time that the conversion van came in handy 
 But it really didn't cause our kids are still little
 So that was the only time we really needed it 
 Other than that it got terrible mileage 
 and 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
