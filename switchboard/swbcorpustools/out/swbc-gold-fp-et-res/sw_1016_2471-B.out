 No 
 I would agree with you 
 We haven't had too much 
 but historically we've always almost been like a big brother and to the Latin American area and almost used them 
 I feel 
 I think something will have to be done down there very soon about Mexico and some of the other areas 
 but with the Persian Gulf as you said it's just been very quiet 
 I keep pretty close tabs on the paper 
 and you don't hardly see a 
 unless it's there and we're just not seeing it
 Uh-huh
 Well that's 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 I agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world 
 so there's a lot of money to be made there 
 and it's very difficult to cut it back to a level where it should be 
 and it will come back to haunt us 
 it seems to come in cycles
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 and probably the biggest problem down there is that's the drug entry points
 and their economy is 
 several of the countries 
 especially Columbia is so built on the drugs that our little war on drugs has really been laughable 
 It's just you know such a small amount 
 and it doe- 
 it just 
 it cuts off just a trickle 
 and if we can't get a handle on that through some method I don't know whe- 
 that will be another big problem
 Right 
 right
 And as long as we're the largest consumer then this is the market
 If we can cut back the usage then maybe it will have to go someplace else
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Right yeah 
 *[[should this be two slash units]] we're just so much wealthier 
 and there has to be resentment built up 
 and that's where leaders can use that whenever the opportune moment arises
 Yeah
 That's right 
 Our own hemisphere 
 but we've 
 that's been the way it's always been
 So 
 Very much so except when we need them 
 You know when they found oil in Mexico then we got very friendly with them again
 Yeah
 
 Okay
 Sure did
 Always 
 yes ma'am
 You too dear
 Bye
