 So you have a [ child two years old in child care right now + *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 
 Yes 
 our first 
 and he just turned three months
 So we're just starting into hunting for child care
 Right now both of us are students
 
 University of Southern Mississippi
 she's 
 Yeah
 probably 
 actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care five days a week more than likely depending on how my class schedule runs 
 because my wife will be doing her internship that semester
 It will be forty hour week no eight to five type of thing
 So depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend to eight hours a day in child care at that point 
 Right now we're trying to avoid it 
 but we just as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a girl to watch him 
 I get out of class at certain time 
 and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class You know 
 once a day this overlap happens where we can't one of us be home
 So for about twenty thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in
 Uh-huh <>
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 that makes a big difference
 Yes
 Yeah
 There's a lot of child care available but invariably there's waiting lists
 And we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with okay the their Home Ec Department
 they have a subbranch American Family Counseling 
 and their people staff the child care center just off campus 
 But they have a pretty good size waiting list
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well it's best *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 a cottage industry's the best way to do it really
 because if you over 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 And it's amazing how much good things like Sesame Street will do
