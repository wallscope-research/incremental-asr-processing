 really
 
 So you went to what college
 And what did you graduate in
 Yeah 
 major 
 really
 I'm going to B Y U 
 and I'm going into nursing
 so 
 Forever 
 Seems like anyways 
 It's about five years 
 but it's probably going to take me longer because I didn't decide to major in that until about a year and a half after I was already in school 
 so 
 really 
 That sounds 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 So what is your advice to picking a college
 Uh-huh 
 Is that what was yours more like
 Was there a 
 Really
 that's great
 Uh-huh
 Wow in high school
 Oh
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh

 so it's hard to get individual help 
 It's kind of you're on your own 
 No 
 Very little 
 well like my 
 for example I'm in a chemistry class right now
 and there's tons of students in it 
 and there's one T A for the whole class

 and 
 Right 
 yeah
 man I think your advice is good 
 let's see My advice would be to pick a major before you get into college 
 because I didn't 
 and I took tons of classes that I didn't need to 
 and I don't know 
 I just feel like it's going to take me a lot longer than 
 and not that's always bad 
 but it's 
 I don't know 
 it's frustrating I guess
 Right
 Yep
