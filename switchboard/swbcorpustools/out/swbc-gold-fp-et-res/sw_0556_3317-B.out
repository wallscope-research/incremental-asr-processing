 Well we live in a brick home in far north Dallas 
 and it's four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back 
 and It's about thirty-five hundred square feet
 Yeah
 It is 
 Have you been living there very long
 So you've been there longer 
 We built this one about 
 let's see it's been years six and a half years ago 
 and we subcontracted it out ourselves 
 We bought the lot and had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications
 and then we subbed it out 
 so we've been here a little over six years now And have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in
 My husband got his big garage 
 we have a three car garage that he has a big work area in
 and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines 
 and so he has all the work space he needs
 He 
 It is 
 and that's why we decided to build 
 We looked at things that were already built 
 and if the house was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have
 Uh-huh
 So we put a three car garage in
 But even if they had three car garages they didn't have a work space 
 All of it was taken up with just car space
 And so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on
 Well sounds like our husbands have similar interests
 I see
 Uh-huh
 Well that's nice that it's not in your house
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well we still have a son and daughter in college that come home
 And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come 
 His parents come 
 and also the kids have friends who come and stay 
 and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom
 Right
 I understand <>
 Well we 
 That's true 
 and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room
 Well I haven't reached that point yet 
 I've heard people say that
 But my middle son is engaged 
 my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while
 He's out of college and has a good job 
 so he could afford to get married but is not engaged yet 
 and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while 
 but she's still in college 
 and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first 
 That's what she plans to do 
 So I hope so
 ho-ho
 A whole new world
 Uh-huh
 I can understand
 Uh-huh
 So you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute
 Yeah
 Well that's the same thing that I did 
 I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren
 uh-huh <>
 Well we have
