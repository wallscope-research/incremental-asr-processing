 Okay 
 How do you keep up with current events
 Yeah 
 what what channel do you watch or what station
 That's the one I watch 
 I usually keep up with T V 
 I don't 
 I am a student 
 so I really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff
 so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which really isn't too great sometimes 
 Yeah 
 The radio doesn't really have much news sometimes 
 The stations I listen to are just mainly music
 Yeah 
 Do you think that T V is pretty accurate 
 sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized 
 or 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's 
 they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news
 Huh
 Yeah
 Going 
 looks like they're going more for ratings than for you know actual news 
 I think you know probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
 they typically have a better 
 I am from a small town too here in Texas that like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato 
 and 
 Yeah 
 farm report and oil reports
 That's pretty sad 
 or who killed who
 Yeah 
 Well in Dallas I don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's 
 and the story was 
 Yeah 
 And the news covered it right you know hours after it happened 
 and they were taping people who were crying who had everything 
 and then like three days later this local news station was using as as their promo to promote themselves 
 I just thought that's kind of cold 
 Yeah 
 and it was just 
 they were showing like these dead people
 and they were showing people crying
 just taking advantage of you know 
 Yeah 
 it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story 
 but just the play on people's emotions 
 It's just gotten so 
 somewhere it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite that if you know 
 and everything 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 What did you think of the coverage of the war
 Did you
 Yeah
 They kept just showing you know how great we were doing 
 and it never really showed the damage that really happened that's 
 a lot of times like the news coverage showed all you know the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties
 and they kind of you know 
 if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know got really hurt and everything
