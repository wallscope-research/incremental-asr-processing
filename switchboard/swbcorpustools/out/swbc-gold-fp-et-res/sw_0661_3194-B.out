 All set
 Actually I'm in Plano too 
 I say Dallas area when I'm talking to people elsewhere
 Yeah
 They actually pay you money for that
 Brookshires up in Allen you bring you know the plastic bags back or the paper bags you put them in the receptacles there 
 but I didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that 
 Uh-huh
 Interesting
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 I think they already do that out East 
 it's a little bit more difficult because people have to remember Okay today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic and all that
 but I think that's the way we need to go 
 it's pretty bad 
 All these years we've 
 especially in this country all the plastic and the paper and everything we just used to throw out
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 about six months ago I started
 yeah 
 so what I do is 
 it's not bad 
 you just have to have a place to keep everything 
 but you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it 
 Just put your paper in the same place every day 
 and it'll start stacking up 
 Take your glass you know pickle jars or whatever liquid jars you know 
 just rinse them out a little bit 
 and put them all in a place 
 and plastics 
 No 
 from what I understand you can leave the labels on although I rip them off
 I don't scrub them or anything 
 I just tear them off
 throw the lids and everything out 
 but put all the glass in one place and plastics like milk jugs orange juice jugs things like that
 Yes
 those also
 and then of course cans coke cans whatever
 But I haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what they take and all that 
 I've just read a lot about it 
 and I'm keeping these big piles of it right now 
 I going to try to dump it out this weekend in fact 
 But you'd be amazed how quickly it all stacks up 
 There's a lot that we throw out
 Uh-huh
 yeah it's not a big deal 
 You get used to it 
 One 
 let me tell you one interesting thing
 when I went back to the store and I said Hey I understand you all are taking these bags back you know what do you do with them 
 And they told me they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then you know go and recycle the rest 
 And I said What do you mean the ones that don't belong there
 And they said Well people come in and put anything in the receptacles 
 And what I found out is if you look at the bottom of those bags Kroger or whatever the plastic ones they've got numbers on them
 Yeah 
 and if it's got the little recycle symbol inside it it's got a number like bags from Drug Emporium have a
