 Hey Steve 
 they just started a recycling program here I think 
 Actually this is my first experience with recycling program 
 but instead of just like tossing everything away which I always felt bad about I am starting to split stuff up 
 The only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb 
 They make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there 
 What are they doing up there
 the deposits only on like drink stuff
 Okay
 Okay
 okay
 So did they 
 are you giving these products to the handicapped group 
 and the handicapped group is getting the the money 
 or are some home distributing the funds back to you
 Okay
 That's very cool 
 You know I heard about a similar program in New York City where a thing called like Homeless Incorporated or something like that 
 but what they do is employ I think mostly men but homeless people to go out and collect all the recyclable cans 
 and I think it's mostly cans 
 There may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not 
 and they bring them up to one centralized location and are able to collect the money from the various beer and soda manufacturers and get more money to these people that desperately need it
 Yeah
 Do they do it with news papers as well
