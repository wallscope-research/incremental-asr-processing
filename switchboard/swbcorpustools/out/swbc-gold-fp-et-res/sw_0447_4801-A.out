 What do you think about capital punishment
 Yeah 
 Which crimes do you feel that 
 Yeah 
 Because of 
 so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent
 selling I think should also 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's 
 Go ahead 
 Texas is too 
 Texas I saw on T V the other night has had forty-six in like the past several years
 So they're pretty hip on it too I guess 
 They do it by lethal injection at Huntsville 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 That's what's happening here 
 There is 
 like that's 
 in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the turnover rates of repeat offenders being let out and doing it again 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I wish if they were going to do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't
 Be a little more you know 
 not being able to put it off for fifteen years 
 really
 Goodness 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah <>
 yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little too lenient
 kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty
 I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas
 audiology
 Yeah 
 What do you do
 really
 Oh really
 Neat 
 Yeah 
 I just 
 this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California
 So I think it 
 the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is what 
 they gave a run down that Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then 
 Yeah
 they don't get repealed as easily as they do
 Like the guy in California got thir- you know twice before he went to the gas chamber 
 and then they said okay no 
 you don't have to go 
 And then they took him back 
 Yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent 
 And then you have like two 
 you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever you know
 No 
 I don't think the military doesn't execute anymore 
 so 
 Or death before the firing squad or whatever 
 So I think about the only one is rape
