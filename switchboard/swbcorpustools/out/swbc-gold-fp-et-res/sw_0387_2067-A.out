 What are you afraid of with them
 Yes
 Well that's can be very very true
 Well that's the idea 
 They figure that if they give you card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it 
 and 
 Absolutely 
 Well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you would be paying interest
 I use mine a great deal for groceries for everything that I can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing 
 right
 That's all right 
 Sounds like you have a little one there
 you have
 Great 
 How old are they
 boy Those are two very active ages 
 Uh-huh
 Well do you ever use the A T M machines
 Well I find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash
 that helps 
 Right
 Well the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash
 and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on
 Yeah right 
 Absolutely
 Because they figure that that's correct 
 The idea is to use their money 
 And during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well I think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted 
 Well i- 
 absolutely 
 preapproved 
 That's their favorite word
 I think so you're right
 Well it's interesting that people have generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go
 That much stuff
 Right
 Well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own
 and that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem
 That's right
 That's right
 Well it's been enjoyable talking with you
 Right 
 Well take good care 
 Take care of your little ones
 Uh-huh
 Bye-bye
