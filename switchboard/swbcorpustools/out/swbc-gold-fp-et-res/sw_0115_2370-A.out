 I suppose I do because I've seen a lot of those changes the changes that women have had in well you know not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years going from 
 well take it back thirty years 
 I'm going back too far from my parents' generation when mom stayed home period 
 and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job well unless 
 if you were educated you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married
 And if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know 
 if you were a teacher Then you know that was it until the kids were little
 Yes 
 there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be on any given day
 and then of course today it's supposed to be all the other way 
 You're supposed to only want the job
 and your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care
 and we have these wonderful people who are totally prepared to teach your child everything they need to know in day care
 and we'll see how the generations go
 Yeah 
 I 
 at least for a lot of women depending on what she did 
 I was mechanical engineer with T I 
 and I did it for six years 
 and for one 
 well I had one while I was pregnant 
 and then one while my oldest was a year old
 and it just drove me crazy
 I could not do either well enou- 
 I couldn't put in enough overtime that was necess- or you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays you know as is needed because my husband for a long time was out of the country also with work for like three months 
 and 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 might have been better
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and so it was 
 in my case I just decided that as long as my kids were little I would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once
 Well actually I've found out that I'm not going to go back to being an engineer 
 I'm a photographer now
 I have branched out 
 I was a photographer before 
 but when I went to college I felt like I couldn't support myself if I decided to be a photographer that it would just have to be a hobby 
 and I'm very mechanical 
 and mechanical engineering interested me 
 so I did that 
 And then you know I did that for six years 
 And then I stayed home with my son and did nothing And found out that you know it was great 
 but I was bored part of the time too 
 And I wanted something else to do
 Yeah 
 it's great while they're really little
 but as they get older and they're more independent and there's things to do then it's good for them to go to different 
 he goes to a mother's day out program now once a week 
 Both of my kids do 
 and so they get the socialization with other kids you know and not really school but a different authority than mom once in a while you know kind of learning how to deal with society
 Yeah 
 I think they do too
 And I need it for the break 
 Uh-huh
 And enjoy it 
 that's the whole thing
 Yeah
 I think that's the thing that were going to see 
 well I think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next ten year {A even now they're starting to do it 
 but I think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years } is that there's going to be a lot of women 
 and they're going to have to work it out to working part time
 Because if I had been allowed to work you know maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week I might still be working basically full time or part time if there had been some way to work it out 
 because I liked my job really well
 But I was just pulled in so many different directions 
 it was just driving me crazy 
 And now with the photography you know it's working 
 that's what I'm doing is working part time because I can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the week and use those hours to do 
 The thing that I'm doing is taking school pictures in day cares and in Mother's Day Out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that
 So my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week 
 or my husband you know when he's at home can take care of them
 I think they're really going to have to and not just for mothers for fathers as well
 It's going to have to be both
 Yeah
 It's just convincing your husband that it's important enough for him to do it
 Because if he saw mom doing only that you know all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it that I should do it or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it 
 I know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if I wanted my husband to do something to help {A and even though we were both working the same number of hours and doing things } I had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done 
 this is what you do it now
 Yes 
 and 
 Yeah 
 and it's just they don't look at things 
 Most of the men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it
 They you know just scoot it on another spot on the sink and put the next plate down and in a while get around to it 
 And I think most women walk in and with got to clean all this up Got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this is the time this needs to be done 
 but 
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 And I think that's going to show up a lot more now in the next generation of boys and girls 
 the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know 
 they were both working at whatever things needed to be done
 They're going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be clean
 And It's going to 
 yeah 
 some kids are really having it 
 If they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't 
 yeah 
 the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases young college
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that was one of the main reasons that I quit was because I wanted my kids to have my values 
 and I felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it That it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little you know 
 this is the way I feel about this 
 and this is the way because that you know 
 if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you add onto it as they get older
 But if no one does anything when they're little then it's twice as hard I think as they get older
 Yes 
 I understand 
 I wait until I put mine in bed before I make my calls 
 That's the thing 
 like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too
 And a lot of it's for the better 
 some of the women's roles I think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things going back to work 
 but I think if we can expand the men's roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably didn't very often 
 I know mine almost never did
