 Okay
 Okay
 Yes 
 it is 
 It's one we all hold dear and near I'm sure
 Yeah 
 most of mine's been pretty good although I guess I'm like a lot of other people now 
 I'm trying to pay off my credit cards 
 and I've done pretty good at it 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 there is a big difference <>
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I do that 
 I do that 
 but like I said the rest of them I've been trying to pay off and get back on a cash basis except for gas 
 It's too easy to run into the gas station
 And 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 So 
 Yeah 
 well that's 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well I've been pretty lucky in that respect 
 like I say I've been trying to not charge except for emergencies
 but I haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards 
 There's you know 
 they have wonderful features 
 they're there when you need them You know like in emergencies or whatever
 Yeah 
 it's awfully easy 
 That's true 
 that's true
 I try to 
 I did switch to one sponsored by the credit union though That seems to be a pretty low interest Yeah compared to some of the other ones
 And you don't have an annual fee there 
 and that helps
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's one way to do it because that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well I'll just pay on it this month 
 and 
 Yeah
 Takes a long time 
 that's right
 And now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off your income tax that's you know 
 Of course it's been going down for a number of years 
 but this is the last year you can take anything 
 So 
 So 
 Well I've enjoyed talking to you
 Okay
 Bye-bye
