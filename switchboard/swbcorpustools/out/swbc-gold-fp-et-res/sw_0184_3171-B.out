 Well we haven't traveled outside the United States that much 
 we usually take family type vacations 
 We're looking forward to one in October to Disneyworld in Florida
 We have a nine year old
 when both of my kids were much younger 
 And this time we're going to be going with just one daughter 
 and she's nine 
 so it ought to just be a ball
 Uh-huh
 I think so too
 wonderful
 So you travel a lot
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 that will be fun too
 Yes 
 We went years ago 
 We haven't been lately 
 and I know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything 
 but we used to have a lot of fun there
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 if you don't like the night life and the antique shopping there isn't much there 
 but that can be fun
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I know this is a real good time to go because they are having so many activities and special shows
 Yes
 Be excited about all of it
 Well not really 
 we're doing the same thing Tying it in with my husband's business trip 
 and I just save vacation for things like that And just travel whenever we can
 How easy

 Our last big trip we drove through New Mexico and Colorado and went to the Grand Canyon and back through Silverton and Durango 
 and it was fun 
 It was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country 
 and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it
