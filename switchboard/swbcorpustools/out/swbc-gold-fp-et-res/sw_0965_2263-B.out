 Okay
 Yeah 
 where do you like to camp 
 How do you like to camp
 I used to live in the Ozarks and liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods
 Yeah
 I haven't done it in quite awhile since I moved down here 
 But I used to do it quite a bit
 Yeah 
 yeah
 it was real hilly
 Take a twenty-two 
 and go out
 Take a twenty-two 
 and find a creek
 I used to go with my brother
 We just lived up there
 Yeah
 it gets kind of 
 we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in get out of the rain
 But I don't know much about camping in Texas
 You live in Pennsylvania 
 I didn't know they did this
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I'm down here at T I
 I used to be in Ohio 
 it's some pretty country up there
 So 
 Yeah 
 they have some nice camping grounds you know that have the water piped out
 just set it up 
 and get out of the city for awhile
 Tell you what 
 I'm losing you
 I said I'm losing you 
 you're fading out
 Yeah
 So what 
 you try to go and take a vacation every year and go out and camp
 Yeah
 I know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the Ozarks
 That's kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping
 copperheads mostly
 No 
 they're 
 Yeah 
 One year they were just everywhere
 I don't know what it was 
 we had a real rainy spring
 and then it was all year 
 there was just copperheads everywhere
 Yeah 
 Well I lived down in the bottom of a big hollow 
 and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time
 If it rained we were stuck back in there 
 Had a four wheel drive
 You just get used to it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 This cave that we used to go in was little 
 it was small 
 it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out
 Yeah 
 He's about a year and a half younger
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 it was 
 Saw a few bears things like that
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 the first couple of times it's pretty scary 
 but after that you realize they are just as afraid of you too
 But 
 really
 I don't know if 
 they don't have them up there do they
 Yeah 
 do they 
 Yeah 
 down here they stopped for awhile 
 or they really made it hard to hunt them
 I don't know what it's like now 
 I haven't been back up there in awhile
 Well it's good to get out and smell some fresh air too
 So 
 Yeah
 Well I think we're about to run out of our time
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I'm sure I will
 You too
 Bye
