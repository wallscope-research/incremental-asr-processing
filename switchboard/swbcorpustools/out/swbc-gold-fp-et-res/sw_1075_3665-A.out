 Okay 
 some of the T V shows I like to watch are mostly evening shows 
 and like for instance the one I'm looking forward to tonight is TWENTY TWENTY 
 I usually watch those prime time programs
 I like to watch FORTY-EIGHT HOURS 
 Never miss that and sometimes PRIME TIME LIVE 
 and then the week goes by 
 and I don't think I ever watch anything else
 You know the Sunday night movies I watch those kind of things but basically a lot of documentary things and you know what's going on and that kind of thing
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's hard to follow
 I've never seen that one
 Okay 
 yeah
 I've seen the previews for that
 Uh-huh
 we never miss that 
 or we try not to miss that
 we think it is so funny
 just part of it 
 Uh-huh
 No
 Uh-huh 
 that's right 
 and the neighbor 
 they thought it was the neighbor
 Yeah
 And then it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor

 I've never seen that program
 Uh-huh

 I don't know why 
 I just 
 if I can catch them I do Or if I remember
