 I guess I've had to return something 
 but can't decide 
 mostly it's been because I didn't like the color
 or I'm not sure whether I've had to return that many things 
 are you
 Okay 
 good 
 so we'll talk about that some
 Right 
 Okay 
 I'm going to let you kind of lead the pack because you sound like you're 
 I- 
 let me tell you just a little bit about myself 
 for years I did all that shopping and whatnot 
 but for the last four or five years I've had eye problem
 and I've had two cornea transplants 
 Shopping is no fun anymore 
 I can't see good enough you know 
 and it's hard to tell what I'm doing 
 and it's just aggrav- 
 I just thought of something we have to return 
 All right 
 it'll come to us 
 okay 
 Are you ready
 Laurie all right 
 All right 
 tell me about your computer Laurie 
 I think that sounds fascinating
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yes
 Uh-huh
 lovely
 
 no 
 the computer was supposed to have two
 I see
 I see 
 In some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it 
 They probably didn't know what they were talking about
 Right
 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 jeez 
 
 Yeah 
 it really is
 Right 
 and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction
 I think that's the worst part 
 I 
 Now that's an advantage isn't it
 It really is 
 I think there's a lot not to be said for credit 
 but that's one thing to be said for credit 
 how it gets you some muscle where you need it
 And I think that's really important
 Yeah 
 That's right 
 <> That's right
 That's right 
 No 
 Yeah 
 they will 
 That's right 
 They will
 they will put the kind of clout on them that you can't really do
 Yeah
 We 
 Hal bought me small well little jam box kind of thing 
 so I'd 
 I have my ninety-three year old mother living with us 
 and so she doesn't remember anything 
 but to keep her entertained music and some of these things do help
 And I thought well if I had a nice little tape recorder you know so that I could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while And then also so that I do some musicals and things like this and if I can copy sections off that I can use someplace I figured well this will be good
 Well the first time I turned it on I was recording 
 and the next thing I knew the tape was chewed up in the thing 
 Okay 
 so after that then you couldn't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side
 And then on the other side when I loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to videotaping they were doing 
 and she says it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far 
 and so you can't get it to run the right way either 
 so 
 Yeah 
 so I wish I could tell you 
 I really don't know which brand it is 
 It's 
 Yeah 
 No 
 I think this is maybe a name brand 
 and I suspect that it's probably just a fluke you know 
 I have the papers and everything 
 and we're going to just take it back 
 but 
 Yeah 
 I think it was you know like a Highlands or something like this
 Do they have Highlands up there
 Don't they 
 Well this was a regular electronics store you know
 So I don't think there will be too much problem 
 but I guess I'm not sure whether I think things are not made as well 
 I think they deliberately sometimes 
 Don't you 
 what are you 
 Yeah 
 That's good 
 they're getting a kind of a attitude of not 
 Yeah 
 Well 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 I think that's right 
 The fact that 
 Right 
 The fact that they have competition with the Japanese and whatnot sometimes dwells on a fact that you know 
 I've known people who have had Toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them
 Well they may cost a little more 
 but they don't have to take them to the shop every other day
 Yeah
 it did a good job 
 so part of it is that we need to develop more of a pride in the kinds of things we do so we make them better
 And it kind of has to start from the top or from the bottom maybe and go clear up 
 People 
 No 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Attitude is just get me my dollar so I can go do what I want to do and on 
 what I'm doing right 
 I think that's too bad 
 And it's a shame too because when you get right down to it most things if you do a good job nobody can pay you enough 
 There isn't any way to get paid enough 
 But if you do a good job you feel enough satisfaction 
 so whatever you're paid is enough
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 I think they underestimate how much value the satisfaction 
 is Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 No 
 it probably basically goes right back into the home though unfortunately 
 Starts with the one person that you know 
 and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay you know
 Yeah 
 that the value is in doing it well 
 and
