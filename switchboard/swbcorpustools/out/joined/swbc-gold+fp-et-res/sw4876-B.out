Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I am a working mother I have three children and my children uh since they were very young I've had various um different alternatives child care arrangements and like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it I personally feel uh in our particular situation I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home and my kids I think are very secure well raised children My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities So I e- you know it is a problem but as you pointed out I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities and that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford When our children were very young we had a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful And then as they got older they went to uh I preferred to call them schools and they were really all day preschools and they were wonderful And I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things But we really truly did pay a fortune we were paying at one point well close about five hundred dollars a week for two children So Well I mus- I'm a physician Uh as is my husband and I felt uh very good about working I'm a pediatrician actually uh but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for I think Oh Well I think it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in And we had a really wonderful arrangement uh I'm with the university actually and they had a wonderful uh program that started at age three and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work And so many times at lunchtime I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing And they had wonderful they had things like gardens and lots of pets and they had a four to one uh teacher student ratio So that sort of an most of the teachers had degrees Uh Yeah It was incredible actually But it was good it at that time there were two children and they were in special programs and each one was a little over two hundred a week and then in addition I paid a little bit extra But the kids were they really had some great opportunities But tha- what you were alluding to earlier is you know women who work for minimal wage and really feel they have to put their children sometimes they do put them in uh fairly low paying situations Uh-huh Uh-huh No even that really I think I don't it's been awhile since I've looked at my youngest child is eight So it's been a little while since I've looked into actually daycare centers But they are you know the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since Uh-huh Something like that Well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children it has been a real uh there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences And I think they have captured a certain market Again the but then there are baby-sitting groups As a pediatrician one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections As you start putting lots of little kids together the infection rates that go around
