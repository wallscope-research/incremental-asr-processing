Uh I don't go to the movies a whole lot but uh I went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw DANCES WITH WOLVES which turned out to be an extremely good movie Yeah it's something that uh my brother lives over in Fort Worth and I was telling him about a couple of weeks ago and he said Well I'll wait until it comes out on uh tape and rent the video And I said no this is not one that you want to do that with uh the scenery and the landscape and the country that they're in needs a big screen It's just beautiful country with the hills and the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing it's uh just amazing amazing picture No it's one I think but you know every now and then you find one that you say yeah this is my favorite movie Well this is the one for me this time Yeah What have you been to lately Yeah Oh yeah Is that right Yeah Uh-huh How's his karate well they do they get well I remember when GRAND PRIX came out when I was a kid and some other movies like that We wanted to jump in the cars and race And I suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it Is that right I did see GHOSTS Yeah I think that GHOSTS was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good And it turned out to be an excellent movie I've forgotten the guy's name who was in it who had the lead role Yeah and I especially like him He's a really good guy Other than that DANCES WITH WOLVES seems like to be the only thing I've seen in the past several months to have any Is that right I've seen the ads for it but I'm not real sure what it's about Yeah That is a strange combination Yeah Oh yeah Both of them Oh Yeah years ago Oh Oh yeah And then defend it Well I guess that's where the title comes from then Yeah it is It's funny we've got a couple of movies out recently GHOSTS and DEFENDING YOUR LIFE that have to do with uh after life I guess And it kind of makes you wonder besides working at T I I'm a graduate student at North Texas and working on master's in communication It's the behavioral science part of communication and I think about these things and people trying to define their own world view and uh what exactly you know do we see about this world or why are we so fascinated with the other world Is it supposed to be better Sometimes I think we think it is We like those things that way Well it has All the way through history there's I guess if you want to call its mysticism or the occult or whatever It's always fascinated I guess because we don't know and there's no real way of finding out There's only one way of finding it No I uh did not The girl next to me saw it and she really liked it Yeah it is Yeah Yeah she said that this was almost believable that could really happen You know you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things and you never know Yeah Yeah I like it when they will do something and not get too silly I've been disappointed in some movies that they don't know how to end it it seems like so then they get crazy and it doesn't end like the story has been going Well I guess that covers our topic Nice talking to you Bye
