Well it's been very windy and it's uh probably unseasonably hot for time right now Yeah we've already had to use that and we've had like this is probably typical though uh we like tornado weather and tornado warnings and uh so uh you know I forget from year to year I'm getting too old But the wind's blowing very hard but I guess you know we're just out of March and uh will bring the rain in uh April Yes it is Seems very high It hasn't bothered me but I know that people that have allergies it seems to be pretty high A little bit warm and a little bit blowy I think Really hard to make too big of different comparisons right Yeah Yes I could stand this all summer I don't think we can either let's cut off You too Bye-bye
