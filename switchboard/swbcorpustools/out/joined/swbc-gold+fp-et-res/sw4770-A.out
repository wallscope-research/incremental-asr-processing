Uh I don't know My personal perception of government and uh the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted And I don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to uh be self-serving to the community I think that they have their own uh wishes to uh be in the limelight and to kind of say hey you know I'm a public official I don't have to do uh certain things and they just stand out more Involving themselves more and more with politics but it's really after all the things that I've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts uh of checks uh before that it was the wonderful uh escapade that they had with uh the new uh oh God chief of uh well Supreme Court I'm trying to think of his name and uh what they put uh him through in regards to Yeah Thomas The sexual harassment that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that I just think it's very corrupt and <> whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor and send them into government versus people that are rich But it's always the rich person that gets into government That has the money to advertise the money to do this There's no more Abraham Lincolns out there uh that can get into government even if they were poor So I know that's my personal viewpoint of things Now uh they've already put through the health bill Yes It just went through and it was passed and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical Uh I don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people You know what I'm saying it's right now every little state around here is thinking about oh we need to reform the health uh system and of course they think uh Minnesota our neighbor passed a state law the health bill and it's kind of like we're the first to do it So I don't know if it's done because we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for uh you know a real good purpose to help people that can't afford uh health insurance that kind of thing Uh-huh Oh sure Oh sure Uh-huh it sure does And I think it is reflecting Like you said I think society as a whole uh you can't expect uh when we have T Vs and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for uh you know immorality and this and this and this that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be totally clean And come into government Uh but down the line it does hurt when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something uh you know it does hurt each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or you know the other things that have occurred so uh Uh-huh Exactly Yeah Well that's exactly what happens in government all the time They blow the whistle on each other Oh I hear that you're doing this I've done it but oh boy and it's not going to get out Ex- yeah exactly It's uh there's no secrets in the government Uh I don't think anymore Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh sure I don't think uh
