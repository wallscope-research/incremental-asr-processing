Uh well you know uh I think public service is a worthy thing and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs uh such as Peace Corps that promote that Probably the most popular one but uh one that is not typically recognized as such is the Boy Scouts Uh I know that because my son is a scout now and uh is thinking about his Eagle and uh in order to get Eagle you have to have merit badges in uh citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world and you have to do a public service project Uh in which leadership is the key element uh <> I think the question is posed somewhat strangely because uh it's talking about a requirement for public service and of course the Peace Corps the Boy Scouts is a voluntary activity Uh Right of course uh uh military service falls under the category uh of a public service And so uh one of the things that would fulfill at least the nominal uh qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft Uh but I agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended There are other things such as civil service uh which many people uh are lifelong employees of but I suspect that was not what they had in mind either More of a voluntary kind of thing or uh Uh-huh Why Why is that Oh no no no It's to defend the nation against external evils Well it depends on whether we figure that we have a defense oriented military or an aggression oriented military
