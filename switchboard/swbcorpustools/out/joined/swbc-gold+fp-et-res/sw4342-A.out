So how do you uh so it sounds like you've got a television going on there so I can assume that you probably watch the T V news Is that Really Wow I Uh what station do you listen to Cliff I see so uh it's not affiliated with anything is it it's not a network station Okay yeah because I listen to uh public radio a lot and they have K C R W which I saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable TV outlet I guess They're getting a little feisty now Uh Yeah so you have a paper or something or Uh-huh Yeah How do you like it it's been a while since I read the Dallas news uh fact last time I read the Dallas news I was in Arkansas I uh Oh yeah Well that must be pretty bad So how did that happen anyway No not how when did they Yeah Oh really Um Oh me uh good grief I read the TIMES LOS ANGELES TIMES There's quite a task if you've ever run into one They're uh speci- Yeah they're thick Uh if there's something you want to know it's in the TIMES  and then +  and  in detail repair bracketing wrong Uh we used to have two papers here in town and then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of oh I don't know just nobody was buying it really Yeah pretty much Uh there used to be fact I think there still is uh the DAILY NEWS which runs out of the San Fernando Valley and uh they're not bad uh you know as far as a local paper goes In fact it was kind of weird because I met the editor uh uh while I was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time It was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff He was a really cool guy Uh you know went to Columbia University and all this stuff And uh it's a pretty good paper but uh you know it's not the TIMES Although you know I'm sorry to see some of their uh there's a daily uh news rack right around the corner from where I live which means that they're expanding I guess and occasionally I pick up like TIME magazine or something I think uh if they've got an interesting lead story but you know it's I don't have time Yeah that's kind of a problem for them There's a lot of people who fall into that category Uh-huh I see Yeah the big dailies don't like to step much uh out of their home turf I have to admit the TIMES is kind of provincial too It's basically anything that's south of downtown they don't bother to cover Uh-huh Yeah I know it was a big discovery when the TIMES found out there was a place called Orange County the way they've been handling it before they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the L A county border Oh really Yeah yeah I find that attitude kind of arrogant though It's like you're taking our money but you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us
