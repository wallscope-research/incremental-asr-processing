Well right now the place where I'm living the yard was basically neglected for about the last twenty-five years so I've been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn and after three years of working at it I've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing <> help out things to the lawn has really brought it back Instead of mowing in the same direction every time changing one time you'll cut the lawn the long way then you'll go the opposite way instead of going lengthways you go width and it helps the grass come back for three years Killing lots of fire ants I was firmly convinced the entire front yard was nothing but one gigantic ant mound Because it was like you couldn't even stand still out there Is this better It was like you'd go out in the yard to water something you'd just be standing still And the ants would start crawling up your legs It's like I'm not standing in a mound though Uh Dursban Two A chemical called Dursban Two it's a crystal Um not bad Every once in a while you'll have a mound pop up but that's to be expected Um as far as I can tell it hasn't killed anything it wasn't supposed to Even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds it didn't kill it Well you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard Uh I found one thing that it's kind of a weird thing to say to put out on the lawn but every time I've done it drives the fleas completely out of the area Powdered sulphur you don't have to put a whole lot out just if you've got a broadcast spreader I think it comes in a forty-pound bag and it's real fine like flour and you just go out and do the entire yard and you don't have to put clumps of it just very lightly cover the entire yard Oh I love it My wife can't understand it'd be a hundred degrees outside I'll be out there <> But it's too hot to be working in the yard I'm under the trees I'm having fun <> and I'm stopping to drink water so what's the problem I've got the this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at Sitting on about a two acre lot now and half of it's the back half is my garden Uh in Missouri City southwest side of Houston Southwest Houston Uh no it's just I've had an very enjoyable conversation with you Okay you too Okay Bye
