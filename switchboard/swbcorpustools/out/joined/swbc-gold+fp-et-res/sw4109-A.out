Uh guy uh some of my things I'd like to have a short work week you know and we need you know better health insurance and you know cau- Okay Okay Okay so I just press one then right Okay ready Okay Well well right now I'm just a student I only work part time but I've work in the job force before and forty hours is just too long You just don't have any time to do anything It seems like Saturday you get off but Sunday you're getting ready for Monday And if we could have a thirty-two hour work week with that happen is that for every four people we could give another job And then that way everybody would have a three day holiday okay And that would make a bigger market We'd have uh more recreation People would have time to do it There would be less of a stress level we'd have less crime we'd have to build less prisons you know less police force that's a possibility one of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the small business can't offer health insurance and it's too costly and what is happening is that they're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it okay So they get a specific rate Well what happens is that if people start having chronic illness and things like that what happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money for one particular it's called a group well what happens then is that they cancel because they just can't cancel an individual So they have to cancel just like life insurance They have to cancel everything So what they do is that they cancel the insurance and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage But I'm satisfied with my job I'm an engineering student And I work for my instructor and I'm not a typical student I'm older I'm in my thirties okay And so I have a lot of job experience and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose but in the same token it's really enjoyable for me because I don't have to have you know nobody breathing down my back and one of the things that I really hate about jobs I don't like bosses that you know want to yell at you and you know are down on your back and all this and that I just really can't deal with that so what kind of jobs have you done Uh-huh Yeah that's just great You have what you might call knowledge power you know when you work at a company whether you know it or not is that you're categorized Some people can be let go and replaced like uh say uh a typist uh somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist But if you're a person that's doing computer type things and you have the knowledge you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system well then you're vital to the company and you get more benefits so That's where I'm like I'm into computers too and that's one of the things that I've found in any one of these jobs and anything I've done is that to have knowledge When you have the knowledge you're not going to uh you know be let go be one of the last ones to let go anyway So what I
