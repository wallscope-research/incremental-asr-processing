Uh I think I am it's been a while now Yeah I've uh oh just recently I got married and we bought a house We're about fifty yards from the golf course but unfortunately the house is taking up my time So uh it's been almost a year I guess since I've actually uh swung a club for a purpose Yeah Yeah yeah Right Right Yeah that's great Yeah Now uh like I say it's been a while for me too uh I've got my wife motivated about it um and uh I think that's probably going to be one of the next investments is get her a set of clubs and uh we'll get out of the driving range and get some interest built up and hopefully uh we can start in Really Well great That's good Yeah same thing here Right right Uh-huh yeah That's I've got the same attitude uh I tell you I started I guess the first time I played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when I was in college And uh uh I took it as a P E course and then kind of left it alone for a while and then finally got into it while I was still in school and since then uh we've made it um as the friends start getting married and things like that we've made a tradition of uh having a Thursday um well have probably like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding uh so it that's back in South Dakota where I grew up uh so uh that's been my main involvement is it seems like I go home and play golf more than I do around here but uh eventually I get people to come and visit me in Dallas and then I'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home Yeah Yep yep Oh okay Uh-huh Yeah that's right Oh it's a lot of fun especially if you can find somebody uh that's got the same level of interest That seem to be the hardest thing Well about that's true of any sport you know If you want to play tennis or racquetball Right and people don't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time you know and uh Uh-huh Right That's right yeah That's true That's true Well that's so Yeah that's absolutely right and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if you know you get in a rut if you do play a lot but you play with the same people you aren't going to learn anything After a short period once you learn everything they've got to offer then you've basically tapped your resources there But uh uh eventually I'd like to work up if my wife does get interested and maybe get involved in a mixed doubles league or something like that Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Sure Right Well that's good that's sounds like a lot of fun Yeah Yeah it sounds like we've got real similar situations uh I've gone home every year now since I've moved to Dallas to go pheasant hunting and uh um the last time I took my wife along and uh kind of the same situation she's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff but uh she'll make the trip for fishing if that comes along but uh it's interesting That's right Uh-huh That's right well yeah I've kind of formed the attitude that you know if I could pick two or three shots uh out of my game every time and put them together on one hole then I do pretty good and I keep rationalizing that well you know I can do it I just got to do it all on the same hole and then it will get better and you just keep going and in the meantime just enjoy what you're doing it really works that way Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Sure Sure And well that's great Well you bet Okay sounds like it Okay Bye
