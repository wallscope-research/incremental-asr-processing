Well I guess um I'll start out and that is um I don't know what section of the public school system they're talking about whether it's the first eight grades the high school or colleges I have mixed views on all three of them Well I should imagine the lower grades what's certainly drawn everyone's attention to that is the fact that uh many of the inner city and uh I guess what we'd call uh ghetto or poorer districts including rural districts don't seem to be able to produce the students that indeed many uh manufacturing and other enterprises want they can't seem to read properly do math properly and conform to what employers want So that's got everybody excited High schools I'm not too sure It seems that high schools at least produce candidates although I have great misgivings about the S A Ts that go on to a variety of colleges It seems a great deal of our public colleges have foreign students in them uh from um a myriad of nations uh and also um uh I think that uh a certain percentage of uh the uh public colleges produce a fairly decent student or fairly decent graduate I should say Oh I didn't realize it was that high Wow Yeah well that's what I was going to point out I think it mostly is that technical Yeah Wow Yeah Yeah Yeah that yeah that must be an inner school I just read an amazing article I guess in this week's NEW YORKER about Baltimore uh which uh went on to talk about I don't know I thought it was rather slanted in favor of the mayor or the politicians in there I do know a few people and have done some business up in Baltimore but it seemed to me that the inner city school system was the one thing that didn't flower too well They talked about individual cases of people trying hard but it was very difficult I think if I was going to fault it now if I'm looking to carry on a conversation that way there's a couple of things that really bother me I think when I learned the other day uh uh that uh the average American now watches seven point two hours of television a day and that school children are not far off that mark with six point eight Now I don't know what school children what year that is that's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube Well I Yeah Really Oh so you're close to the subject And yet you know I have grandchildren I have uh nine grandchildren in various parts of the country and of course you know I can't speak to the rural or poorer inner city schools these kids go to a f- they live in a fairly nice upper scale neighborhood and they seem to be doing extraordinarily well I I quiz them and I talk to them and they read well they do everything well But I I think that's part of the environment Yeah that could be very well true Yeah Right Yes Really Yeah No kidding Oh I yeah I guess I can understand that However I'm a product of the New York City public school system from fifty years ago uh maybe not that long ago but um and so I always felt I didn't get a real good education in the grammar schools and part of high school so I lived in New England at the time I sent all my children to prep school I was f- I didn't have that much money but we struggled and we did it and I thought a great deal of the success that they had in their education was due to the low student teacher ratio And I think that's a formula that could be applied everywhere except it must cost a heck of a lot of money if you do it in public school Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Well that must be then if that's uh I think we both agree on that then a parental involvement has to be there And I guess you got to take them away from the tube also another problem I have is uh I don't really know how to resolve this but is the incredible at least in the high school and college level emphasis on sports where enormous amounts of money are spent and it seems to me that money could be more well spent somewhere else Yeah Oh yeah Yeah Right Right right right Yeah Yeah yeah Right Ri- but uh right uh to you say other things than sports though Yeah I know but they don't just send it to the new stadium or Really well I guess they're Right right right Yeah Well I never thought of that benefit yeah Yeah Well I never thought of that benefit but the consequence then I guess what I'd have to say about that is there can only be one champion Isn't that something though I didn't realize that No Yeah Yeah yeah Well Mark Spitz made a lot of money on it and he came back this year didn't he but he didn't make it No Yeah Yeah Yeah Well Right Right right Right Well I also read I we're getting off the subject here a bit but I do want to add this to that because I was quite interested in that myself but I read where the reason that he had to do this in the sprint events is that national television wouldn't pay for the distance events and they didn't think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors if you brought just the f- here he comes down the finish line right So it had to be where they could put it in one segment and I guess capture the whole thing for some sponsor Let me ask you another question Yeah Well if you teach uh college and I know when I went to college I went to summer school and I thought uh in fact that my idea of it was uh rather than finish early I just enjoyed some of the subjects that I was taking and I had the ability to go in summer school and I did take those subjects so what that leads me my next thought is I understand there's a lot of talk now about extending the school year which seems inordinately short anyway compared to the Japanese or the Germans Well how do you think that would work in grammar schools and Yeah yeah that's right Yeah
