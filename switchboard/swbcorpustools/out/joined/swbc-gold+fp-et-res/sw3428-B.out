Well I guess I stand uh on probably ten for no uh restrictions I uh recently just moved to Texas from uh South Dakota and Nebraska and I guess in terms of gun control I've always uh been raised with the uh idea in the Constitution that uh citizens had a right to bear arms and I realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded uh more uh of a national defense uh than anything else but uh on the other hand too uh people then uh needed to use firearms for um survival in terms of uh food and uh I was raised uh you know hunting all the time I lived on the farm and uh you know enjoy hunting and I guess I have uh some problems with uh being restricted to um owning a gun for you know hunting purposes mainly And um it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where um eventually we may not be able to have that right any more Yeah uh moving to this area of course it happens everywhere but uh I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns uh in the midwest and then uh moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings and uh there seems like killing for no reason at all and uh I think so and there's always uh the old uh saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll get one uh and then uh Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah that's for sure Yeah uh and you know uh I suppose uh years ago way back uh when uh they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they uh were fed up with the government uh and if they didn't have a way uh to fight back they would have been in big trouble Well the way things are going Well you know they introduced some gun control back when I was a teenager I believe in terms of uh every gun you bought had to be licensed I believe And uh you know that didn't bother me uh too much and so I guess it depends um if there are some statistics that show uh that people uh commit crimes on the spur of the moment
