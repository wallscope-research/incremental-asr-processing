Hey Steve Uh uh they just started a recycling program here I think Actually this is my first experience with recycling program but uh instead of just like tossing everything away which I always felt bad about uh I am starting to split stuff up The only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb They make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there What are they doing up there the deposits only on like drink stuff Okay Okay Oh okay So did they are you giving these products to the handicapped group and the handicapped group is getting the uh the money or are some home distributing the funds back to you Oh Okay That's very cool You know I heard about a similar program in New York City where uh a thing called like Homeless Incorporated or something like that but what they do is employ uh I think mostly men but homeless people to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans and I think it's mostly cans There may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not and they uh bring them up to one centralized location and uh are able to collect the money from the various beer and soda manufacturers uh and get more money to these people that desperately need it Yeah Do they do it with news papers as well Huh
