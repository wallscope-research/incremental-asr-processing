Here we go Well the changes that's occurred like how was it maybe ten twenty thirty years ago as opposed to what it is today how we're living socially in comparison to maybe from that time period from ten twenty or whatever you remember it to be Yeah we are uh somewhat conservative but uh socially our crime rate has increased and although it's more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like violent crime is on the increase from what I've seen and um our prison population has significantly increased I would say Um our economy too it's just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what I've read and uh even the well it started spiraling down I suppose in the seventies and uh our recovery uh economically has not been like it used to be To me also our nuclear family is not the same because more people are living together that aren't married uh I don't know if uh can't make any judgments of that nature but uh I don't really want to either because I have no problems about it either way and um kids are I suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to women are more on the rise too so far as getting their careers established and uh they no longer feel dependent upon men That's probably true they are a lot of them that have to put their kids into day care or having more with baby sitters and especially if they don't have boy friends or husbands and uh I guess that's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected Uh in fact uh there was one lady in this area she was caught going to work and leaving her daughter in her car all day Not a baby she was old enough to uh I would say she was five to eight years old somewhere along that range but that's just an extreme example I would imagine you know the situations are out there Um I agree there Yeah um I could agree with that because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age Uh-huh that's an agreeable topic there Um what else considering beside family economics um our transportation system has changed for us we can now travel around the world in no time It's just a hop skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast and uh well I think what's happened too is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day and to keep abreast of the knowledge out there we got to constantly read go to school uh T V watching hasn't gone too much out the door because T V is still well the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular T V programming and watch a variety of programs out there as well as use of the V C R so that I don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education system Do you watch L A LAW I like that Uh-huh Well that's good at least you're hitting the books right Uh-huh Well that's a change then oh of course going to school too it's different from the home environment Um I agree with your parents because uh T V kind of ruined me because that's all that we had well not really but it's uh for the top medium of entertainment Even at your age Uh-huh Uh-huh I see Uh-huh Oh Is there anything else Um Work ethics oh it's maybe getting better Um a little of course we're having to weather through the savings and loans all the other scandalous items that well the greed that overwhelmed us in the eighties and uh I I think it's going to have to have it's patchwork put on us because we have so much to pay for now It's going to be really passed on to your generation and maybe a few others including what's left of ours Well it was nice talking to you And uh what are majoring in
