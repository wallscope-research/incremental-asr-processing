Hi Kay I uh was thinking about salaries and benefits and uh was wondering what's the most important thing to you besides a salary in a job Yeah Uh-huh Sure Yeah I don't ever want to have to worry about that That's real important to me Um you know we have that Aetna that's the insurance that we have right now When we were in Colorado they had um a different type of H M O there that I really liked a lot It was um not that kind of H M Os where you have to go to their sort of like clinics you know but this was just an H M O where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular hospitals and all that but it was with a certain list of doctors that you know participated in the H M O and um you know then you only had to pay the for us it was a five dollar co-payment every time you went to the doctor and uh three dollars for the prescriptions And uh I especially liked the prescription especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time those prescriptions can be very expensive Oh I know especially if you get what is it Seclor <> I think that just about breaks the bank right there Uh-huh Do you have the basic plan or do you have the other one Right The one that's like you get additional they'll pay a little bit more I think for the different procedures We just have the basic right now and for most things it tends to cover it We don't too many major um expenses at this point but we have been able to find dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays A couple of times we've had to pay oh I don't know three to five dollars but that's not that bad Uh-huh No we don't like that either Is his office in Plano Uh-huh uh-huh Oh that's not bad Right Oh yes you're not kidding That's right Well those are some of the things that are very important to us too Um we'd like you know other benefits that are provided um the athletic facilities that you sometimes take advantage of I think that's pretty nice but I have to say that since we've come here we haven't done it too much though we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or any of that But that's a nice benefit to have Right Yeah that's one of I think the hard things right now they're going through some tough times to say the least I know many of us are thankful that he still has a job Uh one of the drawbacks I think of working for a big company is often times you do have to follow pretty rigid um guidelines um if an employee is especially exemplary I think it's often in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say Hey you know this person did a wonderful job give him a big bonus kind of thing A lot of times smaller companies have bonus plans where I think in a large company it's hard to do that because there're just so many people to deal with and you have to have guidelines you know for salary increases and things like that that's one of the things that happens when you're dealing with a large company But Uh-huh Right slash error How long has he been in his present position Uh-huh Well I was going to say it sounds like you picked out a lot of good things you know for him uh to choose in a position and have a lot of thought put into it In a big company though you also get moved around a lot He may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some time Or we may be having to drive to Plano you never know Uh-huh Right Yeah We're very We're very far from our families and it's really hard I have little children and um they were the only grandchildren and so our families are really far away In fact this is a little off the topic but yesterday my mother happened to be on a train going from Phoenix back to Chicago and it stopped in Dallas for half an hour so I loaded the kids in the car and we went downtown and met her train for half an hour and brought her a little snack and an Easter basket and I think it made her trip a little bit nicer Yeah and it's hard just for us to snatch a half hour like that is a special occasion for us So um It's nice that you can have your family close like that Yeah sometimes it can be That's good Okay Well I have too Okay you too Bye-bye
