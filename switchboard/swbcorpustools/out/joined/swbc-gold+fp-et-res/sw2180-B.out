Okay um have you ever been involved in any trials Wow Sounds like it Oh it sounds like it I haven't had any actual real life experience but uh my father-in-law's been involved in uh several trials including uh a couple murders And uh you know talking to other people who have been there and so I don't have any real experience with trials but I do you know I took a little business law in college and I've you know try to keep abreast of things But uh m- I think that the uh trial by jury is a great idea at it's inception back two hundred years ago Um right now though it's so difficult because there's so few courts to get anything really done as you know you spent you know a whole summer on one trial and it's just that I think they're just tieing up the um whole judicial process typo> tying Um there's a lot of things they could do to uh make things easier and uh you know like uh the suggestion that uh maybe uh a judge should be the one who decides on what the sentence should be rather than the jury Uh-huh Uh-huh Jeez Uh-huh Uh-huh Gee Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yes yes I agree Uh would surprise me that uh when I was in Texas I had the uh displeasure of getting a uh traffic ticket And um I went to court and you can even get a trial by jury for a traffic ticket No And I thought my God talk about tieing up things for typo> tying Yes that's extremely expensive the first thing you had to do when you came before the judge was waive your right to a jury trial I'm like God this is ridiculous Uh-huh Oh my God Yes I think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that uh you know people would get a fair trial and not have to go through this process some things are just so cut and dry Um in you know the level of evidence that they come up with now you know when you start thinking about well they've got video tape and audio tapes and you know they've got ways to nail people to the point where they really shouldn't even be going to trial Yes Oh that was horrible That it Yeah Yes I know I only heard portions of that but it's absolutely terrible And you know if you beat a dog like that they'll put you in jail you know Jeez Huh Yes I believe that too Well it's been nice talking with you Okay thank you you do the same Bye-bye
