Hi What do you think about gun control Well I guess that I would like to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or uh have a legitimate use for the weapon I suppose because also living in this area the problems in D C come home very quickly Well I'm not so sure about that but I think somehow uh safety courses or I don't know whether this could be something that was done in school but somehow people I'd like to know that the people who had them at least knew what the responsibilities were whether they followed them or not You know at least there's the moral issue that they knew better Which is sort of you know flaky but still Uh-huh Yeah I don't know this morning in our paper there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license so he went over there and got a driver's license the same day bought three guns and went up to New York and sold them for you know very high markups Now in a sense that's a legal way of getting the guns but certainly the the purpose is not very legal Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Right And I suppose uh you know total ban would lead to more illegal weapons Uh-huh uh-huh Right Uh-huh But that's true some people grew up with guns in the house We never had any in the house so to me you know the first time I saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing And I'm not sure that's good either Uh-huh Uh-huh
