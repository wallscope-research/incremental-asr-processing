So do you have any hobbies Yeah uh I'm an avid gardener oh Um I consider that a hobby I don't know they were like suggesting like handcraft things which I guess that's a really true hobby but I think anything that you enjoy um it doesn't really have to matter it could be working on cars could be your hobby really slash error Yeah slash error should be 'b' well I don't know I told my husband I said you go out some to work on the car it's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong I says you go pay to have someone do it Because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something Oh yeah Um well right now we um start our seeds inside We'll start them inside and uh Yeah well we usually start them right in the house My sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck and a wind storm come and knock it down But she's had really good luck ca- next month well actually if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside pretty much the end of May you can leave them outside You might put them in the ground just the first week of June but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of May Oh Yeah well we live really close to Lake Champlain which is in the Champlain Valley so we're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts so Yeah We are a little lucky Well my brother lives ten miles from here and he gets frost and his crop gets killed Yeah from Plattsburgh Air Force Base But um Yeah Plattsburgh's kind of a uh it's uh depressed economically When you go across the lake um I don't know why we have so much going for us I really don't I'm just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at Digital and well they've had layoffs recently but when we got hired here no no never any layoffs never never and now we're looking at serious I'm a technician When they start getting rid of technicians Well I interviewed with them But I didn't want to go to Texas Even though my um mother's people are from Georgia Yeah Well I guess we have to get back to hobbies since Stick on the subject Well interesting thing that I do is with gardening uh my sister grows flowers that you can dry and you can make uh dried flower arrangements and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun And we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with uh dried red flowers and dried white flowers and uh eucalyptus you know what eucalyptus is It's Yeah it's got a s- Yeah at first I'm like oh why do people like this but it is kind of a nice smell after a while People put them in slash error Yeah slash error should be 'b' it's uh like a fad thing I don't know I've never heard of it in the last five years I've used so much of it that I hate Yeah it is Yeah it looks really potent stuff But uh yeah I think it's the greatest stuff in the world though It's jeez I make all kinds of things with it We make all kinds of things just with dried flowers I almost want to start a business doing it but I'm so uh timid when it comes to starting a business Yeah it is especially with being in on the creative aspect and the crafty end You know after a while you make some stuff then you start looking at it go boy this is kind of ugly But I know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby Um he does it believe it or not I wouldn't imagine why but to get out of the house away from his wife because he's a seasonal worker he works in the construction And up here it's almost a pattern and you see your fathers do it then their sons do it What they do is they work construction then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter And uh this guy was going nuts and his uh son built him a garage and got him some uh oh I don't know what the equipment's called but planers and things and set him up and he makes all kinds of furniture for um his kids and he makes uh uh like little kids' furniture He gets right into it and uh Yeah it's a really good thing because it's keeping him sane plus it's keeping his marriage so plus he's getting on in his years now he's not that old but he's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost to do something like that And uh it's uh hard work I couldn't imagine taking raw lumber and trying to make something out of it He dowels everything And it's all got to line up It's and uh I don't think he goofs too much I don't see too much scrap around God I'm envious Is it going to be really dry Uh are you now I always plant trees in the fall I don't know why so the cold weather can kill them but I guess Oh that's good I guess they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall all Yeah Yeah and uh when you have time to do it My sister does uh flower gardens She gets right into it She spends lots of money on them And I guess a lot of people do do that They landscape their whole house with flower gardens She's got like just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch tree bark all over her lawn It gets ya- Do you have a lot of shade trees around your house or is it So you don't have a lot of tree coverage Because going to make Yeah See um uh uh well my grandmother passed away but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees and they just shade everything Uh it's in Georgia yeah it's right outside of Macon and it's just a I like the way that idea of the south is but when I think of Texas I think of nothing but no trees and just grass Yeah So it's that dry heat Well where is it wasn't it Houston's humid Yeah It's humid
