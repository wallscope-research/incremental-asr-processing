What do you think about the uh Peace Corps or public service commitment Well I think it was uh thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft and people said well uh young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from um some sort of public service like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or uh various other things of that sort And it seems to me that it's not a totally bad idea but I don't quite see how they'd make it work How would they decide who goes into uh building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who goes to Saudi Arabia Yeah the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary And the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be like a draft And some people would get military service and some people would get civilian uh service like working in hospitals This I assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the Army they were allowed to do hospital service or uh things like that and if they re- or farm work in World War One I remember uh reading about and I suppose that there is uh justification for taking everybody if you take anybody But I just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them uh sorting them out assigning them training them would be insurmountable Yeah well it's a possibility Well I think that in the cases like that uh they had to be uh pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war It was uh something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life Oh yeah Sure and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something for their room and board and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend uh even if it's like the Peace Corps where they don't get most of it until they come home you have to pay them something Oh yeah Yeah Now I had a lot of friends who went to the Peace Corps uh back in the mid sixties and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization but on the other hand I'm not sure what the permanent value of it was I don't know what we got for all the money We had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to uh what was then East Pakistan is now Bangladesh and to uh Algeria and to uh Southeast Asia and lots of uh out-of-the-way places But I don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure And it was definitely voluntary too They were not drafting you and sending you against your will Yeah Well what about a voluntary program Do you think that would be a good idea I don't either Yeah out here in California there's a program like that for uh juvenile delinquents the ones that are not dangerous and they don't have to be locked up go to these uh camps And they do forestry work They maintain trails and they uh put up signs and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort And that I know is run by the State but there may be other things I'm not so sure what kind of uh training that is for the future for those kids It's probably a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble but whether it's something that they can put to economic use later on is a different subject That's true Good point oh Yeah Yeah I'm sorry I'm going to have to go but my other line is blinking But it was good to talk to you
