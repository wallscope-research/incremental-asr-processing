I have ambivalent feelings because I don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is But on the other hand it is very expensive to maintain you know Texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country And it's eating us alive budget wise and uh Yes we do practice capital punishment but the nature of the uh courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed Yeah And then I was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because I had forgotten I guess that I wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them Because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know Well I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people You know who would see it Yeah but I'm not sure how successful that is Quicker maybe yeah Uh-huh what kind of work do you do Um well see I'm a school principal Elementary school And in a very poor section of town with predominantly Anglo kids And I see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do and see I'm afraid I think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people that course you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there but I think we would make a bigger investment in kids we'd have fewer decisions to make Down the road you know Oh yeah Well I'm not talking about just in the school system See I'm talking about like in uh I'm afraid I think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared Uh I know the institutions don't work that well but it's a bad day because I get all these kids through my office I have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids Five hundred of them are good solid kids and I have the same thirty-seven in my office every day And a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible Some of them in the penal system And you know you just see those kids going down the road Now not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment but some of them have already been in youth centers And that kind of thing and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals and I'm not talking about necessarily in the school system I'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action I think that's one reason we have problems in schools uh and some of them are our problems but a lot of it's because everything society wants we are supposed to do But that's another subject but Anyway I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody making a decision what to do with them Uh-huh I don't know that there is an easy solution but if you could find a way to prevent some of it and I'm not sure what it would be It would be money better spent than do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard That's true Statistically that's true Uh-huh Are you for it I'm for it in some cases Yeah What kind of crimes would you use it for Uh-huh I would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going You know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children Well you know somebody elected that recently And all the civil rights people are up in arms about it you know But uh
