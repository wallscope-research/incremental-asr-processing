Well I don't know My grandfather is ninety-two years old And he is still living by himself My grandmother died a couple of years ago <> But he doesn't want to move away He lives in a little farmhouse on a farm And he recently had to have an operation but he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home Well he was until this operation He has arthritis And now I don't really think he's doing that well And a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him And I have one aunt that really looks after him a lot But uh my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three And uh died six weeks after they put him in the home Uh-huh Uh-huh But I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job Uh-huh Uh-huh But I don't at least I think some nursing homes do that But I think a lot of nursing homes really uh are guilty of neglect Uh-huh
