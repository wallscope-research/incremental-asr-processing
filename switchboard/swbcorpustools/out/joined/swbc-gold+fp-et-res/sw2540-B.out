Well on a scale of one to ten uh being ten no kind of legislation and zero being uh total ban I probably would lean more towards six or seven Um I feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals Um I lived in Massachusetts for two years and they have a total ban on guns and I saw that it didn't stop crime in that state any kind of firearms Yeah Uh it's there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught um with a firearm and also I think there was a fine No I don't the crime is not any better or any worse it's I shouldn't say I don't know if it was any worse but it certainly didn't get any better Uh-huh Yeah I agree with that I think that the law on who can buy a gun are way too lax I think that the Yeah Um I Yeah I'm not really sure personally I don't own a gun um and I don't think I probably ever would um although I would like to know how to handle one and I think everybody should learn how to handle one Um you just never know when you might come into contact with one Um No Uh nobody in my family hunted uh my father had guns when I was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in Massachusetts We lived in New Hampshire at the time And he lived in Massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns so we ended up uh with these guns and really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere And so that was really the only experience that I've had with guns and it kind of scared me But I think that if I learn how to use one I would feel better Yeah Yeah that's true Uh-huh I would definitely support that Yeah I agree the thing that scares me uh though about where I would definitely want some sort of legislation and coming from the north east I'm just not used to seeing um these and I know this may sound kind of stereo typical but <> the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks That's kind of scary to me that kind of to me it is more like vigilantism You know and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on in L A on the freeways and then you come here in the Dallas area um I don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles Um especially not in the back window for everybody to see Sure you're welcome Okay bye-bye
