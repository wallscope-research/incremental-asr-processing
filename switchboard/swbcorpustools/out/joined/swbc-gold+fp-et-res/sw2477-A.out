Okay so uh what basketball teams are you interested in Uh-huh Uh-huh No they're more of a football team than they are basketball team Yeah You know that's true I don't think I've ever seen them nationally on basketball Uh-huh Huh Um That's not too bad Uh-huh Well I'm uh originally from the Saint Louis area so the only basketball team pro anyway in that part of the country is Chicago So I do pull for Chicago of course this year is a good year to be a Chicago fan I guess because they're doing pretty good Yeah yeah Um as far as college teams uh I know it's really easy to say but I've been pulling for uh Duke for about four years now uh so I finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams Although I've really you know again being from Saint Louis I pull for Missouri Uh but they're on uh probation this year so you can't do much about that But uh Oh yeah uh I watched all three games of that And uh I was very pleased with all three games because Kansas uh you know I was pulling for Kansas on the other side so it was real nice to have the teams that were there Of course I wasn't really I U N L V kind of gave me the impression of being uh uh oh I don't know a macho team you know they seemed to think they were better than everybody else and maybe they were but um I was real happy to see them get knocked off So Uh-huh Oh yeah Yeah Uh-huh U N L V yeah they play the pro style is what I've always called it And uh yeah the fast breaks and Right And uh U N L V wasn't used to that Of course I knew whenever U N L V went in at half time see I don't know if they were necessarily behind but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are Uh and you know that meant that they had to play a second half and they've not had to do that all year and uh That's right Duke's schedule was so much harder than U N L V's that uh it just made them a much tougher team overall and uh that had to help them a lot Uh-huh So do I take it that you think though that the Lakers uh will win or Portland's pretty good Um Yeah Yeah No Well he's uh I don't I he to me is not a center he's more of a real tall forward Uh I think Magic does a Oh yeah That sure is It I think that's going to be one of those uh that's won by the home team you know whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one I think Detroit's in uh that same uh division No but as I heard Isaiah came back this week So uh that might help them Oh yeah Oh yeah That's true Uh-huh yeah but he's been kind of up and down all year uh one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in and then the next time you know he can't seem to hit the side of a barn So I don't know I'm not sure about him this year Uh-huh Well that's when you do it Yeah Well the dark horses Yeah that's Yeah Well anybody who has David Robinson has got to have a chance anyway Uh-huh That's right Uh-huh Huh That's true Yeah Well then he's gone now so they don't have to worry about that Well I thought he was gone period I didn't read the story but I read that uh Well that might have been what it was but I guess the headlines said something about him you know that the Mavericks released him or something maybe I misunderstood what they meant Well yeah you never know Yeah but Yeah That's what I think Yeah Yeah It's coming up isn't it Portland Yeah Portland Uh-huh They've got the two Johnson brothers or they're not brothers but I mean there's two guys named Johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something I forget how that works But um like I said they're doing extremely good right now Phoenix isn't doing too bad So it ought to be a real interesting play-off Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh When it's on the line Uh-huh Yeah that's true Well it's been nice talking to you All right Take care
