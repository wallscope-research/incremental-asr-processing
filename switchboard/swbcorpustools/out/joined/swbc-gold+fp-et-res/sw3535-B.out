Uh on Rutherford It's uh corner of New York uh just west of Mayfield Uh Oh okay Oh they're little ones Oh Let's see we're on government whether we think it's honest or can be I don't think under the way the system is right now it is The ultimate power ultimately corrupts I don't know if there is enough money that you could pay them just you know X amount of money to keep them honest I just don't uh Right uh here in Oklahoma we had a few years ago a major uh corruption on our county commissioners and there were several counties uh including the one I was in that lost every one of their county commissioners and it was to the point of not just losing their job but going to jail Oh they were taking kickbacks Yeah Just a little here a little there Major amount here a major amount there But I think there was something like you know thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail Uh that's small scale I don't know you know I really don't know what could be done Uh That's right The cover-ups and uh I don't know uh I'd like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests I think that's what upsets me worse than that they're getting a little you know uh on the side that it seems that when they get up there it's if I vote your way what it'll do for me rather than this is the way my constituents want it run Maybe and then you think well if it was longer terms then they would never have to try to please the people at home I don't think that anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government Well I wonder if they really were or if we just really didn't
