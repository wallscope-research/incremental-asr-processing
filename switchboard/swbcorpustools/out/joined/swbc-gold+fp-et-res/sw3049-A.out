What was one of the latest ones that you've seen actually Uh Right The last two years I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home I've uh uh become available to come and go more often so I said "hey it's worth it I'll just go at the matinee hour and I can see what I please" It's no more costly than renting one The last see I went about two or three weeks ago and saw F X TWO and that is a really good movie if you like special effects kind of gory and lots of you know action Um do you know that I don't follow performers I don't follow actors Some I know some I don't Uh and he was he was not the star but the one that played in it that I liked best was the one who was in uh oh the one about the old people COCOON uh-huh He was a blond haired heavyset alien in COCOON I don't know what his name is Yeah At any rate I also saw not long ago ONCE AROUND That was with Richard Dreyfuss And that one was just a very poignant story it had people you know a lot of people said it was a really funny movie but it was a poignant humor and it was like uh uh STEEL MAGNOLIAS The characters played very well off one another And there was humor involved but the story was a very dramatic story and I enjoyed it very much What are some others that you have seen lately Oh whoa yes That's one I can watch over and over and over again It sure was And you know the second time you see it you understand more subtleties in it There are a number of good movies like that Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right You don't work Okay Well you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day That's right There's nothing wrong with that Go in the early hours it's a matinee it's not crowded and the price is as reasonable as renting a video And that's the way I do it and I go quite frequently If you are going to be planning on doing that now I was WARLOCK too which is supposed to be the story of a uh witch hunt that is you know magically shot into the present time And the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie I was very well persuaded to walk out Very well persuaded there was more gore than I was interested in seeing But as the movie settles down to a comfortable action uh I can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either But uh the action was comfortable and of course I enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things So I enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore And there were some others but they were done a little more tastefully But uh in the first scene the warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet and I could not handle that I said "whoa I'm glad I have not had dinner" Then uh I saw AWAKENING that's a wonderful wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro uh I uh Robert De Niro what did I say Peter I said Robert De Niro And he has done a really good job of characterizing the uh disabled person And of course Robin Williams always just has an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing Even when he's sad you know you great faith that he will get happy again And then oh let's see there's a couple or three that I would like to go see before they go into videos I guess I can wait another month and they will be videos One is SILENCE OF THE LAMBS I've heard a lot about that one They say if uh you really want some suspense that's the one to see And I understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television Uh Uh-huh And then THELMA AND LOUISE I think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie It's about time for one of those I want to go see that And I'm going to try to get in DANCES WITH WOLVES Uh-huh I've heard it's wonderful too but it's just that they are both very long uh movies and the matinee starts before I can get away from work And after that I get involved in other things and don't want to go back Uh-huh You know I saw that and I cannot remember too much about it Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh that's right I remember now Yeah I remember Uh-huh Well I've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies I think he ought to stay Indiana Jones I realize that he would like his career to develop but I don't want to see him in other things But uh I tell you Sean Connery in the HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER I never did care for him in the James Bond movies I don't know he was too Yeah I didn't care for the type of movie but he was always slick and greasy and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed and I didn't like him But he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older Oh yeah yeah he does and there's a I don't know uh I think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning whether he is or not And he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time And I enjoy those and I enjoy some of the Michael J Fox movies I didn't care too much for the last one either It just was not enough to it Uh No no no it was called uh HARD WAY where he was an actor trying to portray a policeman And that
