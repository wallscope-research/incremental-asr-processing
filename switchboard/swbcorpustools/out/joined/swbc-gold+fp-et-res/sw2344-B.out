Hello Hi Hi Ken my name's Diane Yes I'm in San Antonio Oh Okay Yes I think they'll always represent a threat whether or not there's an active cold war or not Uh it's a totally different economy based on different beliefs and uh different priorities and uh given the uh military powers on both sides I think it's always a threat Probably not no Right Uh-huh and it's recognized that the two great powers are us and them and the great powers are always pitted against each other I don't know they're going downhill pretty steady But I agree right now they're not I don't believe they're a large threat right now I think there's always some threat Yeah Actually I feel kind of sorry for them right now because the people are uh wanting things that we have that they're not allow- just some basic freedoms and their government is not allowing it and Gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying to push Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah See I'm concerned that since he's banned demonstrations altogether that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in Tiananmen Square and he's going to wipe out no telling how many of his own countrymen uh right in the middle of Red Square and uh it's going to cause more civil war than is already occurring I don't know and it might be something that he wouldn't be able to control Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah we've got our own worries at the moment I guess as long as uh they're fighting each other we don't have to worry about them wasting their time with us Well sure but that's an impossibility I think given the differences in the world and people are just too different But unfortunately people aren't that insightful They just see that this guy prays differently and to someone else than I do So therefore he's wrong and he's bad and we have to wipe him out Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh No I haven't read it I've heard all about it though Yeah Yes but people grow up and they forget Well That's one of the places I would most like to go Not right now of course but at some point I would like to go to Moscow just to see all these things that you can see on television now and can read about ten years ago we didn't have this kind of information and we didn't know what things were like So Yeah the people I just feel so sorry for the people in the country that they can't do any- they can't change it They try and there's nothing that they can do Uh-huh Yeah Yeah it's probably not dissimilar from I'm trying to think of the name of the the something like that in Northern Iraq who are actually countrymen of some of them were split off into Israel I believe and some of them are in Turkey when actually they're their own people and their beliefs and their own culture system And they were split up into three different countries and they're very dissatisfied and they're causing wars right now and I don't think it's that different from what the Baltic states are going through Yeah Uh-huh Yeah the one that I think one of the women that I work for is married to an Iranian and so she has a lot of insight because she knows a lot of the history of the countries over there and within five or six countries there are probably ten cultures of people And they don't all have their own country and some of them are mad about it Oh Oh uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah and I don't think the people here two hundred years ago were that different I really don't they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs they might The Baltic states might be feeling the same way that our forefathers felt when they were leaving to come here
