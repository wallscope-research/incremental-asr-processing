Wow that's okay So tell me about your home Uh-huh Oh really what kind of square footage Uh That's okay that's okay Uh-huh Uh-huh okay So where do you live at what part of town here in Denison Or down here in Denison yeah Okay up here then I was going to say you didn't have the typical you have a southern accent but you don't have a Texas accent Well I'm originally from uh Ohio Cincinnati so I'm uh familiar with uh Right right Also I lived in Georgia for about four years so the uh there's a difference too between east and west in the south And uh the way in which people speak Anyway my home um I guess it's about twenty-five hundred square foot and I have uh four bedrooms at the present We're busting out walls and things like that We have two we have two Yeah we'll have enough bedroom space it's we're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small And so we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it And then shuffle the rooms around a little bit Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right there's they uh I know what you're saying there ours is the same and they tend to put windows in the strangest places You know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for Uh-huh you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything so No we don't have a lot of that yeah Uh-huh I figured I'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean Ours are the double pane and you can't really clean them on the inside you know Right I do the house is about um I'd say almost thirty years old So it's not a new home it's seen some wear and tear You know Uh-huh Oh Um that is awful Uh-huh he did it in that The normal tiles right Uh-huh Oh and also they're very heavy and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier Um Oh wow I that's one of the things we've been fortunate with is our uh wiring is okay we don't have enough power um or our breakers aren't powerful enough to really help with the load in the house we need to redo some rewiring ourselves but our plumbing is awful there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house so if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main in the street you know and oh it can be really bizarre And we never know where it's going to flood Uh-huh Uh-huh Um Um Oh boy you do have a strange wiring problem there Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that's something my husband's in construction and he won't even touch electrical stuff He i- he'll do a little things but he won't do any major rewiring He says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it Pardon That's right Well that's the way mine is you know well he said he went up in the attic and looked around and he was like oh my God he says looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there And we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry The roof was really sorry when we moved in we had no idea how bad it was It was a wood shingle roof and we the first year we were living there we had to replace the roof He probably knows I don't know what it is off hand Yeah he must not of we stripped ours off We didn't put it over 'cause we put composition roof on And we completely stripped all the old wood shingles off put decking up put the paper down and just started from scratch Unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain we had almost I'd say about half of the roof off and it did this And a house full of snow and rain and it came down it did this in the middle of the night We have plastic you know just tied down on everything you know as best we could real thick edge stuff and the wind came in from the north and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night and we were asleep and I woke up and I got up and it was about four o'clock in the morning and I heard all these drips drip drip drip drip drip drip I had water coming in every light fixture I had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling everywhere And it filled up my light fixtures because they're the old kind And I would go in and I'd turn on a light in the room you know and the light would come on and the whole thing would be full of water And the light would still come on It didn't blow up or anything Uh-huh Oh Oh yeah that will happen Oh my lord But it's quite a bit quite a bit you know that Oh several of our rooms got ruined we have um we are on pier and beam we don't have concrete slab underneath our house so it got into the carpeting got into the floor The carpeting was already awful anyway but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink s- Oh really Yeah they came in and they had it one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it We had to call the insurance company the insurance company was paying for the new roof but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof was being repaired You know which really wasn't our fault we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather You know and stuff and Oh yeah it Uh the roof Oh yeah yeah it's been done for quite some time We're really glad with all the rain we've had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof Uh see it's three it's just been at three years We've been in the house just the three years We've been doing a lot of remodeling it had a detached garage and my husband's built a walkway across and we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that so we What uh the walk Oh yeah yeah he see he does this for a living this is what
