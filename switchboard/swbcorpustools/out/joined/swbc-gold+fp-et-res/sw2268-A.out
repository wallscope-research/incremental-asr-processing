what kind of fishing do you enjoy So you like fresh water Uh-huh Oh I see Well I was raised on the Texas gulf coast in the summers and during the Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast and so I thought fish came out of the ocean and anything that was fresh water was muddy so I didn't learn to fish in a lake until I was well into my twenties so I had always been a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun There's so many different ways to catch fish You know at night you can go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that Which isn't technically fishing but it's a lot of fun So I grew up fishing What area of lakes do you like Oh I see Oh oh oh uh I think I know where uh Lake Caddo or something like that If it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places They hold tournaments there and everything I would love to do that but they have snakes over there and I'm not too welcome around I really don't want to share a boat with a snake I don't see it I think that I perhaps would let them have the boat or something I'd make some quick arrangements and I've told so many stories about the snakes you know when they pull in there's a snake instead of a fish and things like that I'm just I don't know What's the largest fish you ever caught Oh on a lake yeah On a like that's not a bad size fish listen; transcript should probably read "lake" not "like" I would be impressed I've never done that I've seen it uh and I have no problem going out in a boat uh it's just so dreadfully expensive and there's just so many other ways live down there It's not a treat it's what you do every day You know Uh one of my favorite things was we were forever catching crab and steaming them you know out on the beach and you know just uh pitching them out uh on uh what am I trying to say newspaper and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know and that's it uh but the other little creatures would take care of what was left So going out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because you know there was so much else to do No no I live in Dallas I lived in Dallas We had a house in Port Aransas It's a little fishing village that is Corpus Well uh South Padre is on down the bend it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down it would be in that region Small island Uh Oh okay Was it bad Oh I hate to hear that Huh-uh No no no You went to Galveston Uh I have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water uh what is it the Flagship Is it still there I like that place I didn't realize that had happened for some reason Well of course being raised on the water I'd never swim in it Huh-uh Swimming is for swimming pool That's why they call them swimming pools That's where you swim You do not swim in the ocean No I've seen what comes out of the ocean and I have no desire to share any space with anything like that but huge sharks are down there I mean incredibly large sharks Uh some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night it was incredible the size of them the next morning they would have them strung up across the getties and it you know so just strung up their tails would still hang on the bottom of the getties yeah just I won't have anything to do with Well it certainly was uh Maybe you can get how many have you had very many of these calls How wonderful Maybe I'll just be so lucky Okay I enjoyed talking to you Bye-bye
