That's true Uh-huh I agree with you in the sense that uh I think that it's important for people to uh also share give something of themselves and uh I think that there's too much in a way of self-gratification today and there's not enough sharing Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah and I think the Peace Corps is great too because uh you go to different countries and you see uh in fact I saw an interview on T V the other night with uh Patrick Swayze and he's making a movie in I think it's uh Calcutta or either India somewhere where it's a very poor poor country and he said that people in the west he said since being there and I guess he's been there about six months he said that his whole idea of what's important has changed and he said that people have no idea he said of what human sacrifice is you know since being there he's learned what it is to be poor and have nothing and yet those people have uh such uh a happy uh Yeah in other words they don't dwell on what they don't have they dwell on what they do have and they're happy with each other type of thing he said that when he comes back he knows that it it's completely changed his life Right Exactly Uh-huh Exactly right Yeah Right Uh-huh Well I know that that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of uh you know helping them learn how to survive how to plant how to find water and I've seen so many uh extraordinary things on T V that people have done working in the Peace Corps and how you know uh the people of the community they worked in is so much better it's like one person can make a difference and I really believe that they can in something like that Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh I know and how do yo- Yeah Right Uh-huh I know It's true it really is It's the sad life I think today it's not like it used to be even in the years of my growing up I'm fifty-three years old and I have seen a town change from a town to a city and its uh people you know grow from a small town to a large town and you would think that more people would be better you know share more do more you know be more community oriented and all but if they just get more uh unto themselves kind of right and it's not the sharing of uh a neighbor to a neighbor and we would go out and not even lock our doors and not even worry about it But today you know it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that If you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah In Dallas I I was going to say cause in fact I was talking to someone from Dallas uh just last week and they was saying that uh in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for T I and she had gone overseas to Tokyo and she asked them there if there was anywhere that she shouldn't go because she was alone you know being a girl from another country and everything and she said they thought for a few seconds and they said uh no there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid They said to her that even if she left her purse on the subway okay that she would have that purse returned to her this is how confident they were okay with nothing missing okay this is a foreign country and you would think you know uh being uh an American or whatever you know a foreigner there that that would be all the more reason that they'd take advantage of you Okay And she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in and around Dallas and that's where she was from She said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone You know she had there are certain Uh-huh Oh yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah And that's why I think if people were more exposed to uh especially uh young kids getting out of high school I mean at one time they would go into the service to have the same exposure and you know uh to further their worldliness so to speak And go to see uh foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see it was like they said join the Navy to see the world type of thing you know but nowadays they don't do that anymore It's not a thing a a lot of young men don't even uh have the desire to go into the service Or to uh you know do something for someone else And I don't know I attributed I think a lot of that to women working You know to mothers not being at home the bonding process yeah It very definitely is That's right Yeah And the thing is like I think a man can afford to support a woman but the woman affords the luxuries in other words like anyone can live on a certain income no matter what it is you have to so to speak Okay it's what's important to you Now a family I think that like girls today have children and six weeks later they're back to work They don't even have a bonding with that child they don't ever see the it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child The first like say six years of life So much happens in that period of time and I mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three big deal they're in school you're at work That's great But it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and
