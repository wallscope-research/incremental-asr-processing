Well in a normal route of way we do things how about the ladies go first All right I live in Plano Texas and uh uh today we're not even suppose to be in school because uh the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally isn't any funding for the school systems in Texas today So uh when you take uh uh professionals and put them in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education and they can't get their finger out of their ear long enough to get that major subject in line something's wrong So I think here in Texas mainly that they're not serious they're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for how the level of education should be for children I have a one year old so I'm more opinionated about the observations than the true facts but it's just a shame to me that our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well-being I have a real issue with that Um I think that if from every year when they pull in the uh test that the last three years you know ten eleven twelve uh graders take and then you see that their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states They're not saying that something's wrong with the educational system here in Texas I have a real concern about that um as a matter of fact I'm very content to spend my daughter out of state to college in Virginia uh verses having her go down here and not learn anything uh so I think there's a big concern hopefully the new uh secretary of education will do something to fix the problem but uh I don't know they've got to quit worrying about uh the uh religious uh overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product Uh-huh Exactly I was astonished to find out that across the United States in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed uh the kids nowadays don't even know what the president's fitness education program is all about they don't have to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school And yeah and uh I talked to a thirteen year old last night who uh goes to uh one of the Plano high schools or junior highs I guess and she said that she had a choice she could either have taken tennis or weight lifting so she choice to take weight lifting over the regular gym give me a break the kids sit there and they drink cokes and eat popcorn for lunch and then go out there and lift weights and don't learn anything I have a real problem with the whole system They need to put some sternness back into the teachers and let them be able to uh get the old whip out and get some discipline Uh-huh I used to date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level I was absolutely flabbergasted at what she was paid True she was young you know but still it's the principle Of course if she got her Masters degree it would all be different But uh Oh taxes Lord forbid taxes Goodness gracious if we would uh plan our expressways a little better that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads we'd cut that in half and get some teachers we might have us a problem Maybe I should run for office huh That's true That's funny that's funny Well that's about all I have here Yes one utt ma'am Surely I've enjoyed it Bye bye
