Generally I don't think they are Uh my personal opinion is that uh the politicians are out for their own good because they're entrenched They don't ever have to go out and get a real job They just stay in their current job you know what I mean I think by putting term limitations on you could slow down some of the problems Uh but it has to be not just at the national level but at you know the state and the local level too I know some senators and I don't know which ones but they've been in office since the nineteen forties and I they've never had a job they've never gone out in the real world and paid normal taxes I know they pay taxes but they don't you know they get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and you know I'm going like I don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than I am and they work you know less than I do I think that's true however I think that's always been true that's true of the Presidency too and we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover ever eight years or four years And uh They there is a lot to learn but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up I think two years is too short I think it would have to be extended uh you know a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms or you would increase the length of each term of a Congressman Uh but maybe standardizing on a four year term for Congress Senate and the Presidency and then uh staggering them so that you don't we aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years Uh-huh I think that that's true but then you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin Uh the C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency the action isn't in West Virginia I hate to tell the senator from West Virginia this information but it really doesn't the world does not revolve around West Virginia uh as far as this country is concerned the world does revolve around D C you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics and the C I A is a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia yeah you know it might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive and uh you know I think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that or is it the F B I I don't remember but I think there's Yeah that's officially we all know that that's not necessarily true But I think that there are advantages to having seniority uh or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years I think there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain But I think that uh with all the perks that we've given them I heard on the radio back a few weeks ago uh during the incidents where you know like they aren't paying their restaurant bills and they're bouncing checks all over the place uh one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
