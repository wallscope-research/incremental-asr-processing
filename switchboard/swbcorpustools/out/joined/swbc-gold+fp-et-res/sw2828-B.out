Well Kathleen do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system And what do you think that problem is Huh That seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before That's interesting Do you <> uh yourself Do youself have children who are or have been through the public school system I see So if you were to improve it what would you do to improve it Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Sure Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh That's uh some pretty good ideas Why don't you do something with those Uh-huh Well you should uh run for a school board position Uh-huh That Well my mother was on the school board As we were coming up And uh that basically is the extent to which our family has been directly you know they've always been involved My parents through the P T A organization And my mother was on the school board for eight years But uh that's the extent of which I guess that's more than some people less than others I would uh tend to agree with you that there is a problem The methods of correcting it I haven't thought through quite to the detail which you have But I believe that there's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of even being a teacher And if there was a way through the public mind set that image to be a little higher esteem uh uh a little more prestige to being a teacher And with that of course you know you have to pay them accordingly If we paid them more it would attract more the higher educated people to either move into that field or to continue in that field And then if you paid them more you'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them Sure Sure Uh-huh and it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible as other ones so it's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one other than I guess you kn- how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class You know if there's some gauge that they could make Uh also I've thought about the idea of making teaching and the before you can get a certificate you have a certain residency period much like a doctor Maybe not the four years definitely But some certain type of position where you're overseen to begin with Uh just something to i- rather than throw someone into that environment uh you know it I thought that maybe something Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Sure Sure Uh-huh Sure Sure That's good as a teaching aid But more you see these commercials that have Jimmy walking into class late and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who is in New York while Jimmy's in Rome And you know the whole electronic classroom idea I don't know if I I'm yeah in favor of yeah I think especially in the younger years you need to have more of the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to learn how to learn Huh Is that because that's where the two biggest markets are or I see Uh-huh Huh Sure Sure Right I see Well definitely is a national problem that they need to address Definitely is Right right Well I've enjoyed speaking with you All righty Good-bye
