I have a personal computer at home It's an A T compatible I don't use it very much any more I used to use it quite a bit I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal I do some P C stand alone work on it and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame What about you Do you own a computer Are you leasing them Loaners from work Do you work for T I What brand are they Uh-huh I'm jealous What kind of consulting do you do Uh-huh What kind of work do you do when you're consulting Is it programming related Uh-huh Word processing No I'm not familiar with that Uh-huh So you've got a modem in it then At home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them Uh and so it's an external modem when I got mine I had an internal modem in it I used it uh quite a bit when I was uh uh looking at uh information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in Fort Worth but uh went out of town for a while and sort of got off the uh bulletin board and off of my micro completely and after a while the modem started making noises on its own uh even without using it on the computer I could turn a computer on it'd start squawking So I finally opened up the box and took it out I think that's the thirty second warning Yes Okay Where are you and uh Are you at home now So you've got a lot of traffic noise real close What time is it now where you are So you're an hour ahead of where I am I'm in Central time zone No I haven't done that Uh I know someone who has and she's uh very uh pleased with it She told me some of the things you can do and it's just a very handy tool to have Yeah and you can do a l- it makes things very convenient You can save a lot of money too Certainly cut down on long distance charges if that's what you have in mind I have used Lotus I have used uh Word Perfect uh I not heavy use I've used uh D Base and uh I've used a substantial amount of shareware Um I haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job I've been through three classes and I have a great deal of respect for it Um I haven't done much word processing work with my job I do some and I and the D Base work I've done was strictly class related Well it's probably the granddaddy of most uh data base management systems It's got some pretty strong competitors Some of them have reviews that are better than D Base so I think by now it's a matter of uh personal taste I can understand that very easily I've had a class on um R Base and also in Paradox and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base Um I wouldn't say compatible but certainly comparable Uh-huh I'm a computer programmer on the I B M main frames I do uh mainly business data processing I also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility Um sometimes I get called late at night at home because there's a production problem and that gives me the opportunity to uh come in to work and fix it if I can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone Um I also uh handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected
