Hi One of the interesting things that I have considered about the role change for women is that women of my generation were trained and taught and brought up to be the LEAVE IT TO BEAVER housewives But we are not living in that world Uh-huh families uh-huh Oh yeah sure Uh-huh That's one of the and it makes you really concerned I am glad I raised guys You know let the world train them what to do But characteristically you know the women are trained or have been in the past trained in the home And I really would be at a loss to raise and train a girl I think I would Oh sure Uh-huh Oh sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah I did very much the same thing until my boys got into high school and said Mom please do not be involved Then I went back to work Yeah Sure Right Right Well you know there's a lot of things that have happened actually and it's like oil on top of water it changes but it's never different in a lot of ways Uh women at one time did very heavy physical labor and were expected to maintain a household Then as times changed uh as it is today we do not do a lot of physical labor even in housekeeping and homemaking there's not a lot of physical labor because there are Uh-huh Right And in that respect we have to make ourselves become involved in physical exertion or we really do develop some health problems So in that respect I am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit And uh Oh absolutely true that's true with society in general but specifically the woman's role in society has changed And you know medical reports tell us that women are developing diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases Heart disease was characteristic of men now there's almost equally predominant in women And I Uh-huh Uh-huh Right and I think that that's a symptom of our society it's a symptom that there's a general illness that needs to be healed I do not know what the healing process would be or what was causing the problem I am not God But I do know that in raising my boys I really did meet a lot of pressures saying you know you need to get them into music lessons you need to get them into sports you need to get them into this they need to be busy and they need to be active And I fought all of those things I said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me and they will say Mom this is important to me I want to do it otherwise I will guard their ability to have quiet time I refused to cram their lives full And that's the way it is with a woman too Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Well Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Of course Uh-huh Well I just am very much a believer in quiet personal time If you do not have the time to talk to yourself who are you going to talk to Right And I guarded my children's rights for that and I think that that's one of the things that women are sacrificing that they should not do They are sacrificing their time with themselves There's nothing wrong with sitting and being bored if you thinking internally and you are working on your own self You are finding out who you are Well I think Um Well in the first place it's not your homework it's your children's homework And I was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help I helped them with exactly what they asked for and that's all That's a part of the problem that women have always had and that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other people's responsibilities They That's right That way husbands are crippled they are intellectual cripples and so are children They do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible for themselves I do not know why God made women brilliant I Yes but I do not know they tend to look at the mother as the one who solves all problems They are all things to all people and that's never changed Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh That's right You know I think that's one of the things that we have today that is very useful and I think every woman ought to deal with it or ought to at least be exposed to it and that is mediation training Uh we are not talking about strikes or things we are talking about mediators who get involved in family crises parents and children husbands and wives uh you know boss and employee Those kinds of things Interpersonal mediation because the mediator is an unbiased bystander who
