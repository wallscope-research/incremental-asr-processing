Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh It doesn't matter to me Uh-huh Uh-huh Well how did they feel about uh the United States intervening with Patriot missiles did they Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I live in San Antonio and fifty percent of the population is minority Uh-huh That's the barrios but I don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city It's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks I grew up outside of Houston and uh as far as gang violence and things I don't think it's any worse here than in Houston Houston is not at all Yes there's quite a bit of crime Uh-huh Huh I think it's unfortunate uh as far as the Kurds are concerned it <> I thi- Yeah yeah we can't get involved in their civil war um unfortunately but we've kind of driven these people out Sure Well I think the war ended too soon Yeah we didn't damage enough of their arsenal We damaged most of it but we should have made sure we got everything Unfortunately though the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of Kuwait And once that was accomplished <> it Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Uh-huh I just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet That I still feel like there's more to come I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned They've got sixty or so of Iraq's planes Uh-huh There are some Kurds living in Iran I was real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as much as they did Uh-huh Yeah and from what I can tell if they had gotten into it it would have started a whole new war
