Uh Robert what substances do you think are the most uh likely causes of air pollution Right uh do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from uh industrial areas factories and so on I was going to say so you understand smog Uh-huh Wow My word And that was a few years ago I wonder if it's any better now Because uh California has such strict rules um about emissions and so on Um I don't know if you heard about the uh recent legislation in uh Colorado uh against a power company uh that's actually on Indian land I believe but uh it has been ruled against uh regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon And um particularly in the winter months So they it was uh a landmark case because it's unusual to um I can they were talking about shutting it down if it didn't comply and so on I don't know that the information is one of those wire services kind of pieces of news you know so it's hard I never did see the full story so I don't know But they said that it really caused so much smog over uh the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the uh piloting uh you know the helicopter trips and that sort of thing Which would be horrible because there's nothing that's such a spectacle It would be a shame to ruin it Uh what do you think individuals could do or society could do to alleviate this problem Right Uh-huh you think it's more to society Well I guess I kind of agree there I uh on an individual basis there isn't a lot we can do about a lot of things but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can uh force uh government uh that we elect to deal more seriously with it And I do think that we have a responsibility there I must admit I'm not always real politically active but I do think that um Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards And it's brought the they uh really listen to the uh lobbyist and uh the car manufacturing companies uh you know have really pushed they all those restrictions are really too hard we can't quite make that go and they don't and then we still live with air pollution Um so I suspect that that's one thing that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators But um as a society I think we can do more and that's probably how we ought to do it Uh being individually responsible in order to be group responsible Right Uh-huh I suspect that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure uh come to bear on the companies that deal with it and probably the only way that can happen is for um governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't And uh I don't know how long that will take Sure Exactly yeah right Right Well it's just the same thing with uh uh the gasoline now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline so that we don't uh run into the kind of problems we recently had and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent and they don't want to pay for it So instead we spend billions of dollars going to war Uh you know wha- however it might have had other causes Certainly oil was a big factor Um and I think that's probably going to happen with such things as air pollution when we get serious about our motors in our automobiles uh then maybe you know we'll have a little bit of help Um uh do you have any air pollution in your area Oh no Your talking about from uh the middle states that have more factories and so on Yeah we really don't have that either I lived in this area for about twenty-five years and I think I can tell a difference in the comfort level uh particularly in the summer Uh you know when it gets hot and you have that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air uh usually they say caused by exhaust It seems to me that I'm more uncomfortable and you know my eyes sting more and so on and so on So I suspect that it's an ever growing problem Well I suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here It was nice talking to you So did I Bye bye
