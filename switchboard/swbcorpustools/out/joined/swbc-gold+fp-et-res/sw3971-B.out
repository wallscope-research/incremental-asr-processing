All right Uh I like the Giants They got uh I probably didn't get into baseball until maybe three years ago really so uh but I just like the Giants I don't know why I really got into them I read uh Dave Dreveki's book his autobiography and Yeah that was incredible The way he handled that entire situation there But I just think the Giants have a good team they got all you know they're real balanced out They got real good pitching and they got the hitting to go along with it So Yeah I think they just need that one element to push them over the top you know I don't really know what it is but every team that's really good seems you know like the As they just had it all that one year So Yeah Yeah Yeah if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way you know good and the bad but it's kind of hard I still basically the me and all my friends around here since we don't have anywhere we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams but since no- of me and my friends are really like either one of those teams so we uh about the most baseball we get is either T V or we play it on Nintendo We play R B I baseball on Nintendo So you know that's small town trying to make it through not being around it really but Yeah Yeah so do I but baseball is still you got to do something when football ain't on So Yeah exactly This is America so But Uh I don't know it's hard to say I haven't really you have to just keep up with everything in the off- season It's kind of hard to do at least you know you have to read the paper and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and all that but like I say if they can get that one element that they were missing I think the Giants can do it They just I don't yeah I don't really know about the A s I don't like the As uh matter of fact I can't stand the Oakland As Just because uh you know they've got their Jose Canseco and all the attitude that goes along with that you know They kind of Yeah you hear what he did He ramming his wife's car and I was like yeah Yeah he's just a little boy with a lot of money So That's just you know but Yeah I've heard talk about that Yeah they're not going to be happy about it But I hope they can do good that's just I think they're a good team That just need that one little thing to push them over I don't know exactly what it is They got they're pretty balanced out all the way through It just might be the drive you know more than anything else they probably just need something to push them because that's the only thing I can see that's holding them back is the ambition to do it Or somebody basically maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it Maybe you know that's what some teams need Look at the Twins going from worst to first Yeah my roommate's a Twins fan for forever so he had his year this year so we got into that a whole bunch that was a series to remember for sure So I saw all seven games of that so That was definitely worth watching Yeah Yeah they every team with the Indians been doing that now I can't figure out why You have to figure out why they're all doing that I'm like it's doesn't work it's obvious it doesn't work because you know the Braves didn't win so uh why keep on doing something that didn't work but I don't know I was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball and I get a woman's voice I was thinking uh-huh I talked to a guy named Vinny last night about fixing your car so Yeah I got a call the other night about uh fixing your automobile up so Well baseball's baseball It's kind of I don't know it's kind of odd they pick do you pick the topic or does the computer
