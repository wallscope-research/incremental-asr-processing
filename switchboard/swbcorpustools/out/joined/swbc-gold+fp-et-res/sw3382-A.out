Uh I guess uh I've always been kind of interested in space and stuff I've read a lot of the uh astronomy books and stuff like that Uh Uh to a degree I haven't kept up as uh much as I would like I've just been so busy uh I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then so Yeah Well I wouldn't even mind uh being a pilot on one or right now but I'm probably getting a little too old for that Right Yeah Well they just made leaps and jumps I think a lot of our technology we have is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel uh uh equipment and stuff that Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I don't know if you ever watch Gallagher you know he's one of the comedians and you know he talks a lot on Velcro what would we do without it Yeah Yeah Yeah there's a lot of little things that have come up I know maybe some of the big things that uh uh concentrated foods for one maybe Uh I don't know it's also just I've often pictured uh in my mind you know what would you find if you just kept on going Uh I guess our minds are so uh uh what is it Uh finite when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object and it's hard to see you know I always thought well what do you do hit a brick wall eventually It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely Yeah But Yeah I think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something And I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like you know Yeah Huh I think that's what made us uh progress to the state we are is our curiosity There must be some better way of doing this A better place to be or whatever you know it's So you are always looking for something better I know at work uh people always complain to me well you are always whining and it's I'm always looking for something better Uh There's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it Yeah Well they are always finding easier ways and you know just because they don't talk about it or something like that And they are doing it you know unconsciously Uh-huh Right
