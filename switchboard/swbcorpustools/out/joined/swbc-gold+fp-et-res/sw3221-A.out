Yes we are talking about computers this morning you have four machines around you boy well uh you've got me beat I have a Zenith here and at home I have a Commodore and a Zenith and my wife has an A T and T Twelve Hundred I believe it is Well actually on my Commodore I mainly study lottery numbers would you believe I have written some uh programs in Basic whereby I can select any number of uh drawings and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the most I have another program in which I can look at the cyclical uh appearance of these numbers to see if there's anything that's consistent on that I have another program that allows me to add all the numbers I want and then it generates a complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered so this is what I do most of the time uh On my Commodore on my Commodore uh-huh And of course I have uh word processors and I write all my letters it's wonderful uh my uh thoughts in my head come in bursts of about a paragraph at a time and I get them all down and naturally on a computer if you make a mistake who cares you can go back and uh correct it very easily so that makes it very very nice I get all my thoughts down and go back and clean it up very very readily So how about you Charles Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah So may I ask where you work sir I know you work for the government I just wondering are you an or what section of it Oh uh-huh because see that's my type of work too I work at the Applied Research Lab here on campus and my field is underwater acoustics and there's a lot of things we can do with computers into uh studying how uh things vary in the water you know and uh taking advantage of them and so forth so it's a very nice field and I am retiring at the End of December Yes I'm an associate professor but I'm a full time researcher and it's uh been a very very interesting career believe me Well uh the ones here in the laboratory obviously they're going to stay but I have similar machines at home I would consider doing some more consulting when I get home but I have a very very busy extra life anyway I'm also a musician and I play in several symphony orchestras and uh I run a concert band and so I have a lot of external uh interests but I do want to get much more deeply into computer work because obviously the world is going to be controlled run and operated by computers in the future There's no doubt about it because it is really taking over and the amount of work that we're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers because uh it's so much involved and it sounds as though you're probably more aware of that than I am because uh I don't get to use it in my daily work as much as I would like to Here again let's say I'm starting to getting ready in preparation for retirement uh so basically what I'm doing is slowly getting rid of my things For many many years I had a full size acoustics uh study laboratory where I could take recordings and uh perform experiments with them and so forth and so that's gone now and so I'm sort of out of business Uh as I say I worked with fellow named Steve Blazey was the fellow I worked with for many many years and he is now retired So it's been an interesting life and computers have come in towards the latter end of that I wish we had had computers in the very beginning It would have been
