Go ahead So Ken how do you do your family budget Huh-uh Huh-uh Oh yeah Huh-uh Well then you just pay it off at the end of the month Huh-uh Huh-uh Oh That's a real good idea Yeah See now I'd never get my wife to be able to follow that Before we got married I had money in the bank I owned my own home I put in so much money each you know month towards long term savings you know like in uh mutual funds and things you know and uh after I got married no it just didn't work anymore She spends a lot She likes to spend on anything and everything With body lotion everything So we don't have a good organized system yet Maybe after awhile I'll rub off on her or something I don't think Yeah Huh-uh Yeah Yes So am I Well uh in information systems I'm a voice researcher Huh-uh Yeah So does mine Huh-uh Yeah See I think we might have to do that Of course she looks at what she brings home each week It's going to be hard for her to uh not have her own money Because like now you know I put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years And now she wants to go back to school but she saved enough maybe to get her through August You know and that's it And I keep saying now Laura you're going to have to save a little money I don't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through It doesn't work Ken My mother always said "now don't argue about money" so we don't But you know there goes my savings But you know it's one of those things Yeah Now see my wife will do things like make clothes one of our big investments that you know I was wholeheartedly in favor of was to buy a sewing machine Because she makes clothes And you know a descent sewing machine will really help her out and she's already made you know presents and gifts and shorts for me and things for the summer You know so I guess I can't you know we've probably almost paid off the sewing uh yeah with the savings from that So I can't complain too much you know she's good about that And also we dine at home a lot You know she likes to cook So that saves us from restaurants or whatever but she does have things where she likes to pamper herself that just to me seem like money dumped down a drain You know Yeah Huh-uh You know but you need a hobby Yeah That's true I know and those nails are so expensive Oh gosh I was so excited when she decided she wasn't going to do her nails anymore I guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow And then she waits for them to get their color back And then she'll polish them again I don't know whatever So she stopped for awhile Boy what a difference They buy nail polish every two weeks it's uh my gosh And lotion oh my goodness body lotion we spend more on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things than uh must spend more on one application of body lotion than I do on soap for an entire year Yeah It's funny Oh I think so she's always soft That's true Yeah But I think um I don't know maybe after we're not in school anymore we'll be much better at saving uh I think that's uh I sold my house And that's what's really paying for my time unemployed or whatever Because the ten thousand dollars in tuition really doesn't cover living expenses Um we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job So that makes it hard with uh you know we're paying double rent double utilities and that makes it sort of expensive but see I live within my very menial income and she doesn't She doesn't live within her professional income you know So I just get a yeah and then even if we want to see each other on weekends it's twenty-five thirty dollars in gas every weekend and that really adds up too you know so it gets tough I think we'll do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent and one telephone You know it will cut our telephone bills you know by four-fifths you know if she's here so it's actually tough this year but it will be better in June She will move in with me in June so hopefully our budget will in increase then No Just since December Yeah We're very newlyweds but that's the we're together probably for um uh very close for about six months before we got married So you know we lived within though I had my own house and things you know uh we're still pretty close I knew her spending habits and they're about the same they haven't changed at all you know My mother always said to me "Tom now the best thing to do is be like you're father Never say a word when you're wife spends money" And I was like well that's true my dad never said a word you know So Yeah I don't argue with her but I just get all it must show in my face must be cringes or something you know especially yesterday or this past weekend We met half way between at her parents house and um she had on a new pair of jeans and she'd gotten all new underwear and I was like Laura How did you get all this stuff <> "Well I just got paid" and I was like oh It was there It was burning It had to be spent You know and I'm like and she said everything was on sale Oh oh that's good at least it was on sale That's good honey I'm glad you bought it on sale What else can you say Yeah I think Yeah You don't notice it I think that's probably a really good idea Huh-uh Yeah Yeah see I was when I was living alone and I had my own house and things uh I was paid twice a month one paycheck went into savings and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage and the food bills and it and I was even able you know to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account because I'm pretty thrifty you know But my wife likes to spend She enjoys so that's fine But a for savings I'll have to look into that Huh-uh Huh-uh Yeah Oh really because of the heavy ice It broke the limbs Huh-uh Right Yeah Huh-uh Yeah Yeah I can see that I can that I keep trying to say to her Laura don't spend so much What happens if something happens to a car you know Oh well nothing will happen Oh
