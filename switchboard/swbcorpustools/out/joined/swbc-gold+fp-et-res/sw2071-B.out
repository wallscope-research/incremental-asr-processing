Well as a matter of fact I was thinking about that the other day and uh I really don't know the answer uh I would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but not you know a luxury type sporty one But um something that still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things Yeah well yeah I like some of those things They come in really handy <> Amenities Yeah well of course I guess uh price is always the big consideration but yeah Well that's a big one in my book but uh um I have preferences uh for some uh makers over others um and I would sort of like to buy American but you know I'm not so totally hung up on that that <> I wouldn't buy something else how about you Oh really Uh-huh Oh Yeah Yeah Yeah I wouldn't have thought so either Oh Yeah I guess there's a lot to think about when you're trying to make that decision Right No but then No but on the other hand I guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune Yeah I've uh worked with a couple of people who have owned uh various years uh Mercedes and even though they do a lot of the work themself just buying the parts and everything is pretty expensive But for them it's sort of a hobby too to own them Well I haven't really gotten that far with it um I've always sort of liked General Motors a little bit better than some of the others but uh oh I guess I really don't know Yeah Yeah that I think that's Uh-huh My uh daughter has owned two different ones/ and uh you know we've had some work done on them but it's not too bad and the reason one of the reasons we um bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years and he lived way out in the country so he put a lot of miles on it and you knew it had been through a whole lot and yet you know it held up pretty doggone good so I thought they would Yeah Yeah Well and I guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know you Yeah <> Yeah that's one of the big throwing cards for some of the foreign ones <> <> Well we talked long enough Okay well enjoyed it Bye-bye
