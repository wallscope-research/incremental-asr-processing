All right That's a real different topic I'm not sure I'm familiar with with what they mean of invasion of privacy Yeah Yeah I think personally you know I'm I used to be a college student ten years ago but uh now I think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says Mrs Miller have we got a deal for you It's like how do you know my name where did you get my phone number and why do you think it's a deal for me I mean those people they'll call you any time of the day or night with try to solicit and that's an invasion of my privacy I think Oh they do already Well and I've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays too Uh-huh But I do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls Don't answer your phone Hello The computer's geared to to start talking to you on the on the word Hello Uh-huh Oh yeah Are you and your roommate a similar size And she still goes through your clothes Uh-huh Ooh Oh yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah I agree Uh-huh Oh yeah Yeah Uh-huh My mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets I mean we're all grown all her kids are grown and we have our own families and now if we go through her cabinets she's like Well what are you digging for Like what are you doing Don't you have your own house to dig through Yeah so I guess privacy is really and at the work place I suppose oh well actually yes I can say definitely privacy at the work place I hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk because that was that was where I kept all my stuff and I could tell I mean even if a pen was turned the wrong way  It would drive it drove me batty for a while Yeah well I worked a second shift and everybody else in my area worked first shift and our shifts overlapped so I would come in and there would be people sitting at my desk working and I'm wondering you know um what is this it's my vitamins I wonder what is you know yeah what is why are they working at my desk and can I have it back Can I have it back soon maybe Oh yeah no mommy is going to take the vitamins I'm sorry I have  Oh yeah Well you know how you left it the day before Oh yeah so that's child_talking yeah I agree it's it's pretty tough that way and I know even like with your school books and papers Do you miss your papers sometimes Uh-huh Yeah well actually I do know and I have used it once and it it really is an invasion of privacy but in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live their street address Yeah And that I mean I've I've used it once
