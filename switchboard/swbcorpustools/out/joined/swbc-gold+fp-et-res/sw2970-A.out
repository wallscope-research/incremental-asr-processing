Well I do not know How big a city is Rome you have heard about Dallas and the crime here is pretty bad Yeah I was going to say Uh-huh Yeah Have you ever been there That is uh probably enough to see Um are you in college right now Oh okay Are base that's interesting concept Are bases safe you know Yeah they uh minimize the access Uh-huh Oh no Sure Oh great That is wonderful Yeah Well Dallas uh we lived in Minneapolis Uh we moved here about ten months ago And Dallas is pretty uh well we live in north Dallas which is near a suburb called Plano So we are out of the city but uh it is bad everywhere in terms of uh you know the handgun situation um the number of rapes the number of muggings Just it is I would not say it is not as bad as New York but it is pretty scary You know people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods and you know They call them ornamental grates But they are still bars Yeah It really does And if you are a little bit claustrophobic but uh I do not know the jails are crowded I am not a criminal justice specialist so I do not know you know what can be done I am you know Uh-huh Yeah Oh Were they teenagers or Like that girl in New York that got beat up by you know when she was jogging in Central Park a couple of years ago Yeah Yeah But so they weren't you know And were they obviously poor or depri- you know That is really stra- Like I say s- Yeah Unless they stole it And that is one big thing down here they have like uh and they are not all young they are eighteen to twenty-four some of the young men and women But you can see the Crime Stoppers ads on television And they are sometimes it is the same people that have been observed and they still can't catch them And you are wondering how you know Um we lived in Minneapolis and Wisconsin there was all kind of I know it is getting worse I do not know what the world is or is not Uh the dimi- in a small town in Wisconsin near Madison um a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun And killed his parents and his three brothers and sisters And the child had and they said that he was twelve years old and uh he had not uh displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever you know And you are thinking to yourself um I know That and I do not think a lot of parents I do not know how it is in the Air Force base But uh I just do not think a lot of people because of the economy both need to work you know I just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more Uh Right And discipline I do not know how your folks were but I sure knew as heck when I was growing up that uh my parents were the superior and I was the subordinate And you know It was sort of like there were boundaries And I do not know I think today a lot of parents um are ruled by their kids I Yeah Right they are not learning how to uh well like boundaries I see it in work place too sometimes I do not know how old you are but you sound a little bit younger than me But I am in my thirties and uh I see uh even people that work with me that are ten years younger That you know they kind of have an attitude that I hate to say it but that's just what it is It is an attitude like the world owes them something Do you Are you in the Air Force Okay Sure Huh Right Right right And the Air Force is one of the better military experiences  Pardon me that is are you going to be a career person I'm digressing but I do not talk to many people in the military So I am That is the way to do it and that's you know at least the Air Force is I do not know uh I am nervous in Dallas you know I go to like an aerobics class or something And you know uh seventy women in a Jazzercise class in a public uh parks and rec building And you are supposed to feel safe but then there are all these does not matter race but you know it is an inter racial mix And you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards And I do not even think that way but you just think to yourself you just nobody can think that it can't happen to them No matter who they are or where they are at you know did you I do not know I was in the grocery store this morning We uh went to New Orleans for four days and came back late last night driving And it is about seven hours Um and that is a very we had never been there That is a very very neat town to visit Uh in terms of the French Quarter and all of the things you hear about But the crime is so bad there in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do How to carry your wallet uh New Orleans yeah I would never yeah You just do not Do not even bother It is not worth it Uh when we came back I do not know if you have seen I was in the super market this morning and on the cover of TIME magazine there is a girl she is in Boston She is on the east coast somewhere Real attractive young girl College freshman college coed I think she is a freshman She had been dating a fellow for several weeks They went back to her dorm room and date rape and it just she looked anguished it was really just sad did not pick it up and read it but I should have But I just looked at the picture and thought what a world I do not yeah I do not have any uh cure No you really can't we lease out a really nice two story town home in north Dallas And they have a real big thing here People even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting everybody wants your business kind of thing And my husband is the kind of guy he's sometime he was raised on a farm in southern Ohio near Dayton And I think sometimes it is just he and I are very different in terms of that I basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts And uh he opened the door I came downstairs and I was real upset and I probably got more nasty than I should have But I just said Howard you know oh my God I would not Oh yeah And it is not a reason I have been to New York You should not deny yourself going to visit and all that Uh but it is not any worse I used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by uh are you from Boston Home Owners Savings and Loan in Boston And I know I never felt I have been to downtown New York City and I have been to downtown Boston And I never felt any safer on Milk Street in Boston staying at the Meridian I did not pay for But I never felt any safer there than I did in any other city I have been in you know So I would say one thing Do not deny yourself the New York experience but go with people that you know No uh But yeah I do not know I guess I could go on and on about what to do about criminals {F Uh } I think the handgun I am not real big on guns myself So  uh are the New York I do not know how the New York state prison system is but Are they booked up That is a way to put it they are booked up Are they paroling uh like murderers and here it is just a real big deal They parole people that have killed police officers and then they are out doing it again Uh-huh Uh-huh I know And then you think I can remember I have not been out of school that long but it has been at least ten years And you think to yourself was it that bad back then Or is it just I think that like you said television Is it just that more people think there is like excitement in it you know people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh god yeah isn't it something I am originally from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and I have a niece and nephew And I just uh my ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of that I am just going Michael how did you hear about that You know it is just I think kids get too much too fast And all those sort of things In Atlanta where my inlaws live uh they had that thing you know the high top sneakers the Air Jordans et cetera Kids killing each other and beating their brains out Right or the jackets the team like the Raiders and the caps You know stealing the hundred dollar jackets Uh it is I guess it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that in Boston That is crime where they videoed That is probably one of the most bizarre I have heard of Where they videotape themselves
