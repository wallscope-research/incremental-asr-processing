Are you going to tell me what you've been doing lately in the okay Oh my You are experienced I would say Well I agree I have done something uh like that too only not nearly as extensive But it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch style home Uh after having a one that was historical looking Yes Uh-huh Well maybe you can uh make that one charming and make a little bit money uh Yes Well we just moved to Charlotte from Enid Oklahoma So I know of what you're talking about as far as the market was concerned and I'll tell you uh we had kind of a charming house It was a cedar shake house and very weathered And uh it was about fifty years old but not really uh traditional looking particularly uh so I tried to make it after I sold my business I in I spent almost three years redoing And I considered it a full time job and when we did uh we kind of had planned this uh trek to the east because we're both originally from this part of the country And so I think some of the things that I did paid off For instance one thing that I did that might even be a good suggestion for you uh was something I did on the outside I love old estate sales I happened to go to just a little estate sale just a little white frame house where the couple uh was very old and had gone into nursing homes and uh all the men started going down to the barn And so I th- well shoot I'm going Yes I'm going to the barn too They uh auctioned some tools and things like that but then they went over and started uh auctioning this big stack of bricks And so well I thought gee I've been wanting to do some brick uh walkways for a time Anyway it ended up after some pretty uh heavy bidding that I got all those bricks for forty dollars And so my husband and I loaded bricks in his pickup truck for days But what we ended up with was about four thousand For forty dollars And so what we did we had built a deck on the back of that house but it needed and it was quite large into the yard but on either side of it to the ends of the house it just needed to be all tied together So we made brick patios and walkways And so for and he did the digging which was about six inches but I figured the sand and all had that delivered and leveled it and placed most all the bricks And it turned out beautifully Yes Well it nearly killed me I hated to leave it Uh-huh No we Well I Well no I didn't have that trouble because uh we laid the I did get some material and studied every bit of material that I could study but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them because when you start and we put them on a base of four inches of sand and then uh we swept sand in between but it was an error to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever You just put them together as close as you can Uh-huh Yeah well and I also used a rubber hammer a lot to uh you know if it wasn't quite level or something I'd just get that rubber hammer and prob- you know I think that they could if they have problems with uh sand bugs of some kind I think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on oh a fairly regular basis for a while anyway Well I think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are and yeah is it diazinon or what is it that will uh Dursban or something like that Dursban I think in this area or most all areas they use you know for ticks and fleas And you know they're awful hard to do anything with Yeah I bet Dursban would do it Yeah I think uh you probably just need to make sure that it dries very very uh well before she lets her cats out or something like that Well gosh Deb we could talk all day couldn't we Yes Wow Oh Oh good Uh-huh Yes
