Okay Uh generally I get uh you know most of my news uh in the you know weekly magazines like TIME NEWSWEEK and uh U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT with occasional smatterings of uh you know THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and of course the local paper But uh my only complaint is I really don't enough time to look at the articles every day and go through a paper you know exhaust the details So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines Well yes I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article and so I like the weekly magazines uh because it gives me you know the high points of what's going on Uh but many times uh you know uh the local news kind of suffers you know But here I am you know cheek by jowl with our nation's capital and Yeah Yes exactly Well when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway I'm saying to myself hey guys I'm inside the beltway But uh it turns out that the C N N I think is great And for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events but generally they're more sound bitish you know kind of thing and uh you know I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient uh you know dose of news that way Uh-huh Yes Well the MERCURY and the CHRONICLE are the only things that are really can stand up there Uh Redwood City I use to work at Anteks Anteks Amdahl and places like that Yeah Uh-huh Yes I enjoy see uh we have both C SPANS here but really on the public T V you know MACNEIL LEHRER is an hour's program that I always if I watch any news program it will be MACNEIL LEHRER and occasionally C SPAN I saw the tapes that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust the whole thing was run on that and also they have uh the uh uh PARLIAMENT'S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD It uh you know when it first tuned in on that I you know it's one that's I think it was somebody was just ripping the hell out of another person And I and everybody was you know making noise in the background And then needs slash mark Yeah Here's this dude in a wig and I said to myself it's another Monty Python that I didn't know about and then up jumps Margaret Thatcher off her green bench and I said oh it's Parliament Yeah So I thought to myself I can't wait I'm going over to Britain you know in mid-May I'm going to uh you know approach my uh you know this is how I discovered you know the Prime Minister's you know question and answer period you know P- Yeah
