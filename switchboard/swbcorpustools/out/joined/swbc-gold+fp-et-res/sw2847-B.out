Oh boy Well um I haven't been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately I read uh one book a friend recommended to me I can't even remember the guy's name It was a science fiction Dean Cole or something like that And it was so frightening and it had so much violence in it I just could hardly stand it Yeah I didn't think it was so great She thought it was riveting you know but I couldn't deal with that But um mostly I read I'm a marriage and family counselor and mostly I read things to do with raising kids and now I have two little kids or co-dependency or you know fifty thousand things like John Bradshaw's books on uh THE FAMILY and HOMECOMING and INNER CHILD and so I read usually that kind of stuff If and right now I'm reading um Judith Viorst's book called NECESSARY LOSSES where she talks about different losses that we've had in our lives that we have to get past if we're going to mature and so in my spare time with a two and a half and a three and a half year old I read Yeah That's really changed my reading habits because I used to read so much especially when I was in school You know but gosh uh it's getting pathetic now If I get through a magazine I've been Yeah Later you're probably looking for your kids so you can talk to them when they're out running around with friends Yeah What do you read You do Who Oh well how interesting What kind of books Um Oh my goodness Yeah Well that sounds like a fascinating job Yeah Yeah That's true That's true Well you probably I seem to remember that uh little byline on a lot of things I've read Um is that um do they have a mail kind of campaign that they send to professionals in the social No Um That sounds so familiar Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Oh that sounds interesting Yeah Oh I thought that was going to be some- Oh Oh my goodness Huh Uh-huh Nursing or Yeah Secretaries I bet that used to be mostly men who were secretaries of any type for business Yeah Oh Yeah Then you were important Yeah Yeah Like the scribes who did the old documents you know for churches and stu- yeah Well that's interesting Uh-huh Um Gosh Really So are you reading these in the form of just like printed manuscripts that have not been pub- Huh Yeah My goodness Well that's fascinating Gosh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah  I never have gotten into any of the romantic novels or any of that kind of stuff My husband reads a lot of the um well he did before we had kids the STAR TREK and all those kind of sci-fi kinds of things you know But he's got quite a collection of those But uh my stuff revolves around uh one thou- let's see I've got one called ONE THOUSAND PRACTICAL PARENTING TIPS which teaches you to put elastic instead of shoelaces in your kid's shoes Hey I've done that to every pair my three year old has You know really And uh Oh yeah Yeah but there's a surprising number that are still around that don't have those so that's an alternate means of dealing with but um I'm trying to think of what else I've got Uh since I'm um a therapist and all I've done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step groups So I've got all the different alcoholics what they call the blue book the big book and all the O A literature and all the CODA literature so I'm trying to get more familiarized with that because I refer clients and different groups and uh well let's see I'm trying to think of the Um Oh I have a love affair with John Bradshaw I just have found everything I've read of his to be fabulous um he started out with one called THE FAMILY which does the family systems and people's roles in the family And then he did uh HEALING THE SHAME THAT BINDS YOU about how shame can just be so paralyzing and people isolate and withdraw And then the third one that he came out with is now called HOMECOMING Uh and uh there's a subtitle to it I never can remember what it is It's something like um A JOURNEY IN YOUR INNER CHILD or something like that Oh he's just great And now he's had the first one and the third one put into a ten session uh P B S series Yeah Oh I know Yeah so people can just tape them I guess you know But I definitely have gotten a lot out of his lately He's just probably been one of the most there's an author um that's in uh Arizona who used to be in Dallas It seems like we have a lot of these that have been in Texas called P M Melody who does a lot of writing on co-dependency And she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and uh a workbook called BREAKING FREE and just some real uh helpful practical things for co-dependency So that's been another one that I've thought was real helpful But other than that uh my reading centers on PADDINGTON BEAR and WINNIE THE POOH and DOCTOR SEUSS But I really have enjoyed exploring children's literature because there's so much more uh new things out that you know I'd pull out the classics once in a while for my kids but there's such cute things out for kids Oh I know And I just go to the library because they're expensive it and they go through them so fast you know So I really have been going to the library and getting my ten books out and they just love to sit and read And now finally the littlest one is oldest to sit you know and watch the pictures instead of grabbing it and trying to rip the pages out So that has been fun to do that you know go through the children's literature and uh uh Uh-huh Oh wonderful Gosh Really Well I'm going to have to look for those Yeah Oh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
