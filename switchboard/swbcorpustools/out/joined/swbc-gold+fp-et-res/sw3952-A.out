I'm ready Do you exercise uh during the day time or go to a gym or anything Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I try to do it at night before I go to bed Um it's really weird because I'll get down on the floor and I'll holler and tell my cat Nikki I'll say Nikki I'm going to do my exercises now And she can be upstairs in the bedroom and I don't know She knows what I'm talking about You know pretty soon here she comes So I lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises you know Uh I had a problem with my back so when I went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back So I just try to keep that up because it seems like if I don't then my back gives me a problem again So I try to do it every night and uh Yeah it seems like it's you know I can tell when I do it and when I don't do it you know so you know it's got to be good for you But um a long time ago I belonged to a gym but uh now I notice that in this small city that I live in they do have a gym that just opened up here about a month ago So I was kind of thinking about joining it but I haven't even gone down there and talked to them yet But uh it does really make you feel good and I like to bicycle too So that gives you you know lots of exercise So Uh-huh Oh my goodness Yeah otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far huh Oh really Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah well like I say I just do it at night you know and um try to get my stomach muscles toned up You know because boy they seem like they really get out of shape and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape you know So I try to do it every night you know like I say I'd rather do that than watch television anyhow you know So it's just kind of nice and especially when I have my cat that comes down and joins me You know so Well I guess that's about all I can tell you about my exercising I wish I knew how to swim but I don't so I don't go swimming Uh-huh but they do say that swimming is really really good for you you know for every part of your body So I wished I did know how to do that If they had a pool here in Patterson I'd probably you know put my bathing suit on and go down there but they don't have a pool in this small city either So Well listen then it's been nice talking to you Okay then Bye-bye
