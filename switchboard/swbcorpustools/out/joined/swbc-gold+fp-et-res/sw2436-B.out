Well I haven't had too much of a chance to watch T V lately So probably everything I going to say is kind of dated Yeah Oh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah I think when you're in college you have more of a regular schedule in terms of you can watch every week So yeah I used to when my kids were real little and I was home I watched where I was home where I watched things on a more regular basis But right now the last things I watched regularly was THIRTY SOMETHING when it first came out Did you all ever watch that Yeah Yeah Yeah Right right I know but I tell you what um we're really strict with our kids about television and one night couple weeks ago it was just happened that we were exhausted and they wanted to watch and we said okay well we'll sit down and we'll you know look at what you want to see Let's just turn it on and see what's on We could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it So you know it was prime time it was what eight o'clock on a week night and we have cable and there wasn't anything on any channel and the stuff that was on the prime the networks you know A B C N B C C B S was it was just um dribble you know it wasn't even funny it wasn't creative it was the worst I've seen I have not watched prime time week night T V I guess in a real long time because I was shocked You know what I'm saying Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Right Oh Yeah Right it's just uh like a necessary evil when our children were younger when they were like four years old three years old five years old we just had Sesame Street and that was about it you know But now in order to seem you know humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff But it's just one of those things you know you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if you're in the room But it's such a shame because it could be so good I don't understand why first of all the public puts up with it Second of all why the networks think that you know we enjoy that kind of stuff It's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that That can't be the problem It must be the marketing pressures and you know their demographic studies that they do that show you know that everybody's I Q has dropped dramatically or something I know Why do you do this I know I'm trying to think if there's anything I do uh I like stuff that's on Great Performances and we used to watch mystery quite a bit and things like that Stuff I guess that mostly public on public T V As a matter of fact you know when I was a kid my parents used to have we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular T V that we watched we had to watch an hour of public T V That was just the rule And if they saw us watching something they'd say all right what did you see on WHAT'S NEW or there was some other the children's program I think at the time was called WHAT'S NEW So we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program do you watch sports on T V Are you a sports fan Yeah Right yeah Yeah Yeah that's true the traffic Uh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I enjoy that but do you get that come- You don't have cable now I was going to say they have a comedy channel now But again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly uh commercials and then you're you know trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up You know what I did There was a time there where I could tape things and then I'd fast forward through the commercials Saved a lot of time that way But that takes too much planning Now yeah is that still real good It used to be real good But Is it Oh Oh okay Yeah Yeah Right right Isn't it such a long running program Yeah they do have good writers for that Oh that makes me think do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE at all Yeah we try to stay up too It's getting harder and harder Ten years ago wasn't so hard to stay up Yeah it was we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there but we started watching again But it's real different show than it was when it started It's funny now and it's better but it's real different than what it used to be But you can't be outrageous You know if you keep that same format There's only so long that you can be outrageous So Yeah but you have to hunt hard for them Yeah I guess so Well Yeah good talking to you Take care Bye
