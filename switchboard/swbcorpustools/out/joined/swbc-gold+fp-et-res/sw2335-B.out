So what do you think Yeah What about I agree with the upper and lower level you know because that's the lowest thing for themselves plus there's nobody for them to look up to But I also blame some of it on parents because parents aren't parents Because I remember even when I was growing up I'm thirty-five I remember when I was growing up and I had friends they used to do stuff like you know go over to a store and steal stuff My mother warned us it's like I don't care what your friends do If you do it then that was it And I knew that I would get in more trouble from my mother than from from anybody else And I think that's the basic is they have no morals any more so they don't care So But now as far as what they can do about it I don't know You can't make parents be parents You know I guess if you gave the gave them jobs that's another problem with the United States there's no jobs any more But That would work to a point Well that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway I don't care what you do to them You know so I think it depends on how much trouble that kid has been in you know Because a a a child can get into anything regar- I don't care how good you they are Eventu- at least one time but now if this is a repeated thing here with this child in juvenile and or to me yeah both of them Because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do Because I just watched it on T V one night on one of them um Twenty Twenty Forty-eight hours one of them shows where this boy had been stealing cars I don't know if you seen this it was a little it was a little gang of them stealing cars you know And then when they caught him you know his mother sitting there now they going to take me away from you That meaned she was warned But see by that I think sometimes it's a little late You know but I'm sure there's something can be done Yeah start prosecuting they but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system Well they should start with the if they would get rid of Seems to me I know there's a lot about court that people don't understand There's more people in jail right now for child support okay then there are for people doing drugs You ought to take all them little misdemeanor people let them go let them go you know give them a fine whatever make them do civic duty whatever Put them fools in there I call them all fools idiots whatever Little rock stars put all them in there You know the murderers the drug dealers the user put them all in jail you know and let all the normal people go you know because okay if you write a bad check you go to jail right Let them people go Not let them go and get out of it Let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else you know like cleaning up the city or however they do their community time you know whatever that is But pu- don't put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals Uh-huh So I don't know some people boy they got I think the United States has got too many problems to be worrying about everybody else Now how they going to fix it I don't know I don't think there is a ready solution Because the economy is down people you know the the the low man on the pole is getting more of the I guess the bulk of it And he's got to work extra hard just to make ends meet Uh-huh Yeah That's it So you know they I I I know that's bad but you know just like Texas now They could have had a lottery They don't want a lottery Why not I would rather pay for a lottery a dollar two three dollars whatever I'm paying you know a week or whatever and never see any of that money than to have them take a portion of my paycheck Because you know they take and Uncle Sam takes his the Social Security which probably won't be here when I get that old you know Because we're paying for Social Security they using now Who's going to pay for mine But it's it's No you don't count on Social Security But it's it's that's what I'm saying they need to do something else But Crime is going to go up as long as the economy stays down And it's going to get worse That's just like last night they killed them people in that store Where you at Oh No wonder you don't know that I'm in Dallas But last night they killed uh uh four people in a chain food And killed them well it was two stores side by side One was a store and one was like a a fast food place chicken or something I don't know Anyway they raped the women beat them all up including the women I mean they just beat them Stuck them in the freezer and then shot them all Why was you know why you know why didn't they just if they was going to lock them just lock them in the freezer take the money you know They didn't have to kill them or rape them or anything Uh-huh It's just getting really ridiculous down here I wish I could move somewhere where this you know you got to like in the country Well I think if it's the town is smaller and everybody knows everybody it's harder to come in there and do something Where is and and and see that's another thing Neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods any more There's nobody is next door to you you don't know your neighbors and stuff like that It's just huh-uh you know because I moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers And you didn't even and what the manager the manager won't even do anything Uh-huh You don't And so I moved because I moved the day probably a week after one of the apartments blew up you know and this is like across the street This was a nice part of town and there across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that making that um crack stuff and then the other time I saw the cops break down somebody's apartment around the corner I say See this is it That's it and I moved And you know now I live in like a fam- a neighborhood in a town house but it's nice I don't you know But I don't know how they can live a neighborhood or apartment complex That's what happen that's what wrong you know I don't think don't rent to them Or rent to them and evict them because they drug dealers Put it on the lease If you deal drugs you can't live here Uh-huh That's it All righty And I thank you Bye-bye
