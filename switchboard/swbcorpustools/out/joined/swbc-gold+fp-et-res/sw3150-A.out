Well it's I am pretty much against it Yeah How about you Oh good we can have a debate Well like um I don't know I think that I one of the reasons that I'm against it is that uh um I'm afraid of someone losing their life for um wrongly Right and uh another reason but one of the arguments that really uh made me feel kind of strongly against it is that uh you know someone said to me once well imagine if the person you love most in the world like your mother or something if someone killed her wouldn't you want to see them killed for the punishment But then I thought about it and I thought well the loss that I would feel at losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person no matter how rotten they were somebody loves them How about you Yeah that's true Uh-hum Right Well you know that's true because um a lot of um these conversations I've had on this program these telephone conversations have revolved around um criminal you know justice Uh-huh Uh-huh Or whatever and most of the time I hear myself saying well you know we don't have enough room left in the jails and people crime is still climbing and we need to have different punishments you know but I just am scared of capital punishment I guess Uh-huh Right Especially when it's so far removed If it's no one that I know then you have to think about the taxpayers paying the shelter and feed and clothe them for the rest of their life Letting him out again Uh-huh Uh-huh That's true You know I just recently moved to Massachusetts I'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment and that was one of the questions but uh I do know that they are notorious for paroling people Yeah when and then having them reconvicted for violent crimes And I guess they said you know do you think it should be restricted I guess if because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment I guess violent crimes would be the crimes where I can see it making the most sense You know violent crimes uh with just malicious intent Yeah Hang And what is he going to do prison to the other people Right Well I saw on a human interest story or whatever today there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back she was off drugs and everything but she said uh you know in prison you can get anything You can any drugs you want There's it's just like being outside You know people find ways around And there's a power structure that you have bow to and for some people who have been there for over and over and over it really isn't uh as bad there's it's not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect But the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation and maybe that's one of the reasons why crime has gone up because it's not so scary anymore Right And what they're going to be doing when they get out Handed it to you <> Oh oh I see Well maybe if they could uh if they had more money or more resources to work more on rehabilitation deep down I think every human
