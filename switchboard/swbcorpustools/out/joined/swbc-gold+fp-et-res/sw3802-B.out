Oh okay great I'm in Addison here Right I do uh quite a bit of sailing I own a sailboat that I keep parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop and we take it out and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts but I haven't really been taking it out recreationally too much lately It's just I don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore/ so it's hard for me to get it somewhere but Yeah this one is not that big It's a day sailer It does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of stuck your body out the hole back into the main part of the sailboat/ but it's they're they can be black holes to throw money into Boats are kind of expensive to maintain Especially a bigger one The bigger they are if you get a big cabin cruiser or or a big ski boat power boat then there's always uh stuff to go wrong with it A sailboat at least doesn't have an engine to mess up but you still have to worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging uh everything that's in it It takes a a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up but  Oh come on--this if followed by a 14-utterance turn by speaker A; it must be an incomplete slash unit  Well  See note on B40 utt 3  it's a lot of fun I think uh just from the standpoint of getting away from the dodge here and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation uh especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever uh or a cabin or something depending on how much you like to rough it but it's uh Use the boat for transportation They just go across the boat and tie it up and go in huh That would be fun I've just never I've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat Uh once I get my son into and through with college he's going to be starting uh Rice next year so he's going off but uh once I get to that stage where I'm not paying for something else and uh I don't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things where I've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it uh I might do something differently I might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them keep it and maybe consider getting a better one for me Uh Yeah I think I would Uh the sailing part of it I like because it's so quiet And if you get a big enough one then you've got a little motor on it also where if it's light wind you can still putt around a little bit and have fun or if the wind dies you're not stuck in the middle of the lake I've with my little one I've been out there many times on a calm summer day where all of a sudden the wind stops and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in and that gets hot and wearisome doing that And if you're a big enough boat to have the little auxiliary motor on there at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in But it's fun I own an insurance agency a managing general a wholesaler of insurance uh out in Addison and uh I'm a scout leader though so I'm out with
