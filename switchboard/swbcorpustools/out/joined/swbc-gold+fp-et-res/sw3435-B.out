Okay So are you a golfer or are you a spectator Well I'm the same way I go out there and hit the ball Yeah Um uh well in the Carolina's it's just you know we've got a bunch of golf courses around here Uh well I'm not a serious golfer at all uh uh a friend of mine goes golfing a lot and he drags me out every now and then and I don't really even have a game I usually when I go out and play golf it's usually like at one of these par threes that you know you but um I like watching it on T V Uh Well if I can hit a great deal like um my friends to get me they say I hit worm burners because I can't hit it up in the air So I'm pretty bad but I get great distance hitting it you know across the ground and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I'm but I'm getting better I've got where now I can hit it in the air some of the time Yeah Uh so I'm kind of a novice at it Well I guess that's what I need to do is get some kind of lessons or something Because my tee off is not bad I'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that it's just that initial tee Just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really you know checking the ground and so forth you know See how it's going to break or whatever Yeah if you get down on the ground you really can Um well you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's you know because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction Yeah Yeah Yeah But I the it's like I said once I get up on the green I'm fine but that tee shot uh it you know when teeing off I'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground so it takes me awhile to get to the hole but I'm all set that sounds good to me Well it usually takes me about probably two or three to get it there and then that's according to the hole and it ju- uh uh maybe one or two putts It's according to where I'm at on the green But the friends I play with uh they play all the time and they're really good Uh they're not Joe Pros but they golf in the high sixties low seventies so I guess they're pretty good Yeah For eighteen Yeah No no no that's not my golf That's my friends mine I'm usually in the eighties or nineties so I'm not good Well teeing off I either slice it or I hook it ever single time and I alternate
