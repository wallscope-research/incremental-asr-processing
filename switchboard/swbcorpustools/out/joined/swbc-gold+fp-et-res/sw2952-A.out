Okay what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Oh I uh like sports type things too We like to get out and walk and we like the water sports too But like you unless you have a pool in your backyard it is kind of hard to get to do that very often Yeah Well part time We are going to have a baby in July So part of my big hobby has been trying to put together a nursery and all that kind of stuff lately Yeah it does I have been Yes Uh-huh I have been doing some cross-stitch for something I wanted to put in the nursery So I have not done that in years but I have kind of enjoyed that It is just hard to find the time to sit there and do it Right yeah And I guess I kind of consider shopping a hobby I just go out just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes just look Yeah yeah we bought some baby clothes yeah last weekend at a garage sale Yeah Uh-huh Oh Wow Yeah Yeah it is kind of a hobby that is time consuming too really to find the things that you want sometimes you have to stop  Looks like including A61 there are 3 slash units here  at a lot of places Right yeah I think that is important too I am not going to work after the baby comes So I guess hopefully I will have more time for hobbies I do not know Right Yeah Wow Yeah Yeah So that is good A whole fam- your whole family can enjoy those hobbies Oh Oh wow That will make the summer go by in a hurry Keep the kids busy Right Yeah Yeah Uh do you consider yard work a hobby at all or is that just a chore Uh-huh Yeah Oh no Huh Oh well we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it I like to put flowers out and you know a few little things like that But as far as mowing every week and finding time to get all that stuff done it gets to be a chore Seems like sometimes hobbies do that They kind of take over and turn into work instead of fun Yeah If it does not go quite quite right Oh no Oh that is nice Yeah Your How funny I think I will enjoy cooking more when I am not working when I do not get home until five-thirty or six and I have to cook and clean up it is not fun But I think I will like it better Yeah Uh-huh Uh yeah we have done a little bit of camping We like that It's there again it is just so hard to find time to get away for a whole weekend Oh That sounds fun Yeah Well that sounds nice I think that would be a good family thing to start doing more often Uh-huh Yeah we have camped with some friends who have young children and uh if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a line Oh they have so much fun doing that And they think they are really great fishermen because they are catching so many Oh Yeah Skip this tournament Right Yeah Do you do any other crafts or anything besides your sewing It is not too hard It is I do not think it is as hard as like knitting or crochet or something like that Yeah Yeah I started to knit a sweater And I got off on my rows somehow and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front And then I tore it out and threw it down And I never have picked it back up again and now I can't remember anything about it Oh uh-huh Yeah Forget it Yeah Yeah I remember that Yeah Yeah yeah They are pretty easy Well it has been real good talking to you And I hope you enjoy your camping trip Uh-huh used to mean "you're welcome" Bye
