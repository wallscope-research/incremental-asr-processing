Well none at the moment No no no I currently drive a Ford Taurus And I would imagine that if I change or if I get a new car I will go with the Taurus or something similar uh in that regard Absolutely I have had it for about two years now and uh it's everything it's supposed to be Uh I haven't had a minutes trouble with it and uh the only thing I have against it in that's it's a Taurus but even after two years I still feel uncomfortable driving it because I had a Honda before that and so it's a little bit larger But that's the only difference that I see really But I would my criteria at the moment it would be uh American uh personally an- Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well my wife still has a Honda Accord and it's an excellent automobile you know price and so forth I'm not a real car fan So I do not uh opt for uh something that would be you know expensive you know I want something that's serviceable something that I can use uh and I and with the Taurus I have a Taurus uh L X and it's you know you're talking when you think about price it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines And as I said as far I'm concerned it has been extremely uh uh serviceable and everything I wanted Uh-huh Oh I think so too Now I you know in travel and renting automobiles uh in I've driven you know Chevrolet automobiles and Dodge and I if it's Chevrolet I just will not touch it Uh I had a Chevrolet before I bought my Taurus I purchased a Chevy um Citation And uh I was ready to get rid of it two months after I bought it uh so I shopped around and if I had thought I uh wanted to pay the amount of money I probably would have gone with uh uh an Accord or even a Civic or something comparable from Nissan or Toyota uh but it was just I have a friend who uh has uh an auto shop and he purchased one of the first Sables that was uh manufactured for his wife a Sable station wagon and he just absolutely swore by it And it was upon his recommendation and so forth for you know comparably equipped you know with cruise control and air conditioning and A M F M radio and all these other things uh it was just there was no comparison Uh the only thing that I find you know if I would have anything against it is that it still has that soft American ride Uh not uh that's about the only thing I find you know disadvantageous to it But my criteria is simply something that looks good something that's serviceable and you know I drive around a lot but uh and you know it's very comfortable on the highway I can drive for you know ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way But those are my criteria and I probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again and if there's something out there that uh is comparable to what I have now I'll go ahead and get it Uh-huh I yeah In our parking lots uh two or three days ago I saw one of the new Honda sports cars Uh I can't remember what the name is It's the thirty-five or forty thousand dollar one whatever it is and it resembled a Mazaratti <> very very closely And it's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth but to pay that much money for an automobile uh is just I can't conceive of doing that Uh-huh That's true Well The difference there between us is that I am not really crazy about driving I never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when I was young when I was sixteen So I've never really cared Now what I was you know before I was married and before I went to graduate school I used to do little sports car racing it was never my own car it was always someone else's And that sort of thing I enjoy but to go out and drive uh never has really had any appeal to me in that regard So Well I guess we've discussed that enough don't you think we won't get the recorder or the uh system to shut us off uh tonight That's happened to me almost every time I've Well it's very easy when you get on a topic that you know you enjoy Oh yeah Well I was talking to a lady last evening and we were talking about fishing and uh we were cut off well we were told to quit Okay Well you have a pleasant evening Take care Good-bye
