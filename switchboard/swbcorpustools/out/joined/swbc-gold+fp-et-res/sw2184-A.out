Uh being a former drug user I guess I have to say at this point that I do approve of it Uh because I know that uh in using drugs I was not a good employee And so I can see from the company's standpoint that there uh whenever you are an employee of the company you are using it's assets uh b- you are also under their liability under the Workmen's Comp Uh on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases and I work for a tire company Modern Tire And uh it's also a retreading plant and that's where most of our uh injuries occur And what we do is we'll have a drug test if a break or a man uh has an accident Then he's automatically uh given a drug test Yes when he goes to the doctor the first time And so that kind of uh I don't know if it's been a deterrent or not because we have uh just started using it oh for the past year or so Now we've let some people go uh that we found that drugs were used in their system Now I don't know how T E C would handle it They haven't pursued it you know Uh if there's some uh problem I know there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines and he went to a separate drug testing firm and they showed it negative So I think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried you know Uh-huh really And then I also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine And he tested positive on cocaine Now then you always wonder well is he just saying that Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah because you're endangering everybody's lives if it's something like that Uh-huh You're kidding The executives right The executives Yeah Wouldn't that be awful if you were using and oh lose your job and everything I can't believe I was so <> brazen before like I say I'm a former drug user but uh I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior and so I don't use drugs any more Uh marijuana cocaine and amphetamines Um yes uh-huh And all on the job too You know it had gotten that bad Really it's life is so much more enjoyable Uh-huh And I was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know you know there's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing Uh-huh that's right Yeah That's right Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Oh goodness Yeah Yeah Oh my gosh Yeah Uh-huh Right I would think there would be But they weren't Isn't that awful Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah Huh Yeah That reminds me of uh I have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time and I have just casually asked her what he did for a living And she said Oh he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff And I just you know went Oh where Let me move as far away as possible Yeah But I'm proud though that um you know I grew up in the sixties and back then it was popular you know but people have really you know become wise about drugs and they really have a good campaign for the young people you know They know it's not smart So I guess it was just a generational thing That's right and that's good That's the best way to stop it Yeah well I think we did it So it's good talking to you Yeah bye-bye
