Right I am very much for capital punishment My Dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus And I've been raised around prisons all my life And I believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime there's not any deterrent That's right Especially not a federal prison Well see uh the states prisons were under a mandate to uh it was over crowded and the federal came in and said hey you know you have either got to build more prisons or let people go And finally our governor at the time who is not in office now came in and said okay where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let loose Under early bail you know or early uh get out But uh we have the death penalty is not given often But there have been w- And you know I maybe uh well it should be given you know I won't say sparingly but I do believe it should be befitting the crime Right Of course you know they're entitled to a speedy trial But then they're also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals So somehow you know it doesn't really balance out too much And it seems even though you know that they got the prisoner himself can come to the point that hey I'm tired I just want out You know I'm tired of fighting it Then the system just keeps on And at that point you know I really think there needs to be maybe a shorter appeal process Well part of that is the overcrowding of the court system Uh it doesn't help them any at all and of course your court system when you get into the appeals I don't believe criminal is in a court by itself And the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldn't be in there We've gotten into a very litigious uh type of life Well I just I just feel like their crime and punishment and if you don't have the punishment you double your crime And you know that is just personal feeling It's not going on facts I think the facts would probably back it up but What Well yes I
