Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Well that I know wh- the things that we kind of looked at is you want to see how many teachers you have and how many kids they have and how they break it up Because we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in it was a really good one and in fact it worked out for us because we kind of bartered My wife did artwork for them you know so we got our day care free But they didn't have enough teachers and Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh Yeah did they separate them by age group Because you know I think that's one thing that was important Uh-huh Yeah it sound yeah It sounds like to me your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people Affectionate people that they're may be parents themselves or something Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff but if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good Yeah Yeah An- the other group that we had was kind of interesting The other one we went to it was a husband and wife team and we knew them from other associations but uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one and I think you know she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff you know but he was actually um the more uh what demonstrative type The more loving he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids and it was kind of interesting to see that it was actually the man in the group that did that side of it An- Yeah so they had a really nice balance We liked that one In fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something but they also did some of the teaching things and then they had um you know obedience was important you know so uh oh I think they used the you probably heard you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself And it's one Uh I can't remember what they call it actually but you just stand them in front of a clock and you know it has a second-hand that goes around And they have to stand there
