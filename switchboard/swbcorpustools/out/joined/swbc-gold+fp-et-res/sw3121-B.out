Well I think for me I'm from Alabama South Alabama and so I grew up in the midst of civil rights movement Uh in a pretty liberal family for that area at the time And so I was very much a part of uh you know what was going on there Uh my parents are pretty active and uh it was very scary but now we've seen you know uh black people have a lot more civil rights in that area and I guess all over than they did you know twenty years ago There's still a lot you know to be accomplished but for me when I think about social change that's what I first think of because I can remember you know separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well that's true That's a good one right there Right And I grew up out in the country too basically in a rural area and with lots of family And so we were always at family in different family members' homes But even now you know they don't even do that Well and they're so busy people's personal schedules are so busy a lot of it has to do I think with more women working in our family you know twenty years ago not that many of the women worked And now uh almost all the women work And so that means you know a lot of the social visiting and all was I think probably instigated by women at that time Right And now That's right And now uh my mother does not work and you know she's finds herself pretty alone a lot because most of her friends are working women But even just social visits people don't do that anymore You're right And people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore There's a real Right you know You want to make sure it's okay or I guess we don't not to invade people's privacy or whatever Well out of fifteen grandchildren in my family only two of us don't live within fifty miles and most live within ten or twenty but it's a rural family and most people didn't go away I'm just one of the two out of fifteen that don't live you know even in the same state Yeah There is in that area Uh-huh And I guess you know that would greatly affect social i e social change Probably the job market and the economy has always affected uh social change Probably Well I think just also you know the women's movement too has affected a lot of social change Uh people marry Yeah People marry later basically I think now again where I'm from in Alabama that's not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school But now out here in Texas where I am now that's very unusual Most people go to college or at least get a job and even you know a lot of people seem to be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up Right But probably uh you know more women being in the work force also greatly greatly affects social change Because it affects child care and Uh Right Well and they're saying right now we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties They are the first generation that basically grew up with day care And so you know it remained to be seen exactly what that does Uh-huh Where do they live Well they're not too far though Uh-huh Well I live like fourteen hours from home In fact I'm driving home tomorrow so To go be there for the Fourth of July No I can drive it all It's just me So I can make it I'm thirty-five Although it is pretty I don't know I don't enjoy it that much It's pretty much like get there and It's just not that pleasant Even with other people I basically just don't like to drive that far Uh-huh When you say you're in the second phase of this project what is the second phase of it Oh
