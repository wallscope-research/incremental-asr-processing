Uh-huh Well we have it just opposite here My wife works    in you know at  + at  + at  the T I and she's uh sedentary all day long so when she gets home she likes to mow And we have about ten acres and she tries to mow about half of it Well yeah it keeps uh well it's doing real well because when we got this place the dirt was just overgrazed you know it was bare dirt in a lot of places and now you know since we've been mowing it and you know of course we water a little bit that's just too much to water all at once but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in we've reclaimed a lot of it Yeah but we don't do much in the way of uh flowers We have one little flower garden that we work with The rest of it is just like wild flowers and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers They're about oh I guess a third the size of palm of your hand and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush Yeah Well my wife and I really enjoy that sort of thing Uh she enjoys mowing I can't believe it I hate it Right We don't even have any concrete or asphalt Uh-huh Yeah but you know we do everything together this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the actually this fall I was talking about two weeks ago we got a thousand pine trees from the you know soil and conservation people and uh we're in the process of planting and we're building a stand uh just to the north of our house and along the east uh property line and uh I think what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because I tell you in the winter time when that wind comes out of the north it just cuts right through you like you're not even there So On the other side of the house though that's where we have all the delicate flowers and the mums and we have morning glory and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers and we planted those out by the septic so that uh they get plenty of water and we get hummingbirds come in the spring you know all summer long And well when we leave the doors open they fly in the house Well yeah they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat and when you're as busy as one of those babies you've got to eat most of the time And we got a few you know we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders But you know for the most part gardening for us is well we got asparagus and uh we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries Man we get the best strawberries that you just can't believe We just got our last tomatoes Yeah Well these are accidental tomatos Well last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes of course you're going to lose some that way and the seeds go right through them And wherever they pooped
