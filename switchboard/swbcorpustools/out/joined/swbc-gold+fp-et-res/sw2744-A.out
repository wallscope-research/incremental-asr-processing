Uh-huh Um I think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system as far as uh people dropping out of school uh grades on test scores being low uh more and more people taking G E Ds trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school You know something must be wrong as far as uh not just the teaching techniques but just motivation within the schools themselves Uh-huh Oh it's okay Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right and I know uh I work around you know a lot of teachers and I understand how uh supportive they are of their students and how excited they are but some how I don't think the students are getting excited Oh yes definitely uh-huh Uh-huh Right right Uh-huh Progress uh-huh Yeah not even that much probably Yeah uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh And speaking of doing what you want uh just in society today being that it's nineteen ninety-one um a lot of teenagers and young people have a lot more freedom as far as what they do as far as you know even something as simple as staying up late um watching television late um going out late start dating you start dating too early you know just little things like that that do start in the home that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day or more in school and so any other part of your life that's going to definitely affect your school life because you spend so much time there Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right I talked to a guy the other day and he is now in a program that's trying to get him out of high school because he fell back several years ago and he will have gone to school five years Um and the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died and he was having to uh support his entire family take care of his brothers and sisters you know and all that had an adverse affect on his school life And yeah and that's a perfect example of how your home life you know plays a definite part And you know any other aspect of your life but now that he's in this program and you know he's I guess okay he's making straight As and you know I guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time Uh-huh uh-huh Right exactly Uh-huh exactly Um Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh When people start talking about programs that help for me I don't care if it's socialist or I don't care as long as it's something that's going to do some good or that looks like it could be beneficial that's the point I'm at now that's the point we all should be at is like finding some solution you know nothing totally radical but if it's something that you know might help you know because there's not a lot being done Uh-huh uh-huh Right Uh-huh Take them out Yeah not very far at all Uh-huh I mean it's almost like Right right Right An a lot of the parents now are so young You know they still don't know what's going on and how are they supposed to you know teach their kids that are coming up you know what's going on it's a vicious cycle that we're you know smack dead in the center of and we have to try to swim out You know kind of like the Bermuda Triangle we're just sinking and it's almost impossible to swim back up But um yeah there's definitely problems its just the solutions you know they're going to be in our political system they're going to be on everyone's mind for quite a while too long Uh-huh uh-huh Right Uh-huh Um uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Right Yeah there's right There's definitely too much leeway as far as I've been out of college only two years and you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out and I really don't see myself going back to school or anything but I appreciate more what I had And I had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm and I just didn't take as much advantage of it as I should have No I went to U T at Austin uh-huh So I mean all kinds of resources and you know just there and I'd give anything to have that right now in my regular li- you have everything given to you I don't see why people wouldn't want that I don't know I but then if I was young I wouldn't see it But you know now that it's gone I Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right yeah I did a lot and I experienced a lot and I feel like I got a good college education but just when I got out I feel like I should have spent more time in the library I should have taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were you know the informal classes that you don't get credit for you know
