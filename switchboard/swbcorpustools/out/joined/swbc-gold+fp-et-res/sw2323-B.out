All righty So uh do you think Russia's still a threat There you go Well I think have you ever read the book NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR Okay you know like how uh there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other right and you could picture it as being Russia versus the U S during the whole time and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them because the people there could realize that they were the same as themselves you know the prisoners of wars were the same as the people living in that country And you didn't want that to happen And to me it had always been that way I mean what happens is you have a government right and this government controls everything right and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself And these people are the same as you are And what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country supposedly U S or Russia attacks a country it's not going to be within the borders of the U S or Russia itself Like I was telling people I'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on in Lithuania they were announced to be a separate country But yet the government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people and the U S didn't go in there and try to save those people You know It's like you're not going to go in there and say no listen there's a separate country Why because you're going into the border Right Once you get into the border then there's a threat But what happens is you don't mess with us we won't mess with you but let's mess with the neutral countries You know and now you know they're saying I guess other leaders were still crazier about it you know like other people you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there but Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere And the U S has You know it seems like their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do the job with uh you know less suffering You know but I think the thing like they were saying they go you know like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button But not the U S S R The U S S R wouldn't do it Because they got too much at stake Yeah Well my point of view to that is is that the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within you know three hours of when the weapon was shot Right And what happens is suppose they get Saddam Hussein which they eventually will he's got one less thing to go against him if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because he's going to be captured and you know But the U S also makes a lot of uh you know treaties with other people like saying okay if you give up then you can come live in our country and we'll take care of you like Marcos right We'll overthrow you but yet you can still come live here you know Uh no No Yeah Right Right And uh you know there's just you know like like the U S goes and goes into Panama and what see I don't believe in war That's my thing I don't believe that anybody should die you know and so then you know you have because what happens is suppose I go to war and I'm holding a gun and I'm just looking at myself holding a gun and whoever shoots first survives you know But that same person also has a family and you know his parents are going to cry and you know life ends there and to me that's ridiculous You know I just don't believe it I think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't but it's pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down and it's legal in a situation like that You know Yeah Yeah Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous and all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning and keep his power but well No I don't think so I think uh they're especially getting their life back together now because a lot of things that you saw on TV a lot of uh inhabitants of Russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to A lot of like dancers and stuff like that They said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete So it must be a beautiful country It's just that you know they won't let you get out and when you want to get out of the country that's what you want to do So oh well I got to go to class now Nice talking to you Bye-bye
