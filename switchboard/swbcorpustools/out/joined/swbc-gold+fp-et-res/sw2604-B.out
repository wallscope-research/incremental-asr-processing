Right Uh who wants to start this one Right right I'm not sure I want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision Uh that doesn't sound right Um I guess I see overall beneficial if we're going from that point of view Um you know in the past I don't know how old you are but when I was uh in high school it was the beginning of Vietnam and so forth And many of my peers were being drafted And I could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever But I felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that they could help the country in other ways Be it cleaning out uh lots in their neighborhood or whatever kind of community or public service might be available And I guess I see that as not so much a demand but a privilege uh uh It's something it's since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between uh there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest I just see that as maybe a good idea I wouldn't mind doing it at forty-four Uh and I find ways to turn some of that back to others Uh and I guess I can't see that as being something to really object to I could see a gamut of different kinds of opportunities Things that need to be done that could be done in an hour or two uh a day or several hours of the week Like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that In addition to what one does uh besides that I can't imagine what kind of uh uh bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time oh you're going to go to this camp and you're going to you know like um back in the Depression the C C C the construction corps that went out and did things That was great Why isn't "That was great" an independent slash unit  it was needed it gave some folks some jobs and we got some great public works out of it But um I don't see that as being necessary now I can see it being done uh on a regular schedule Uh everybody has to put in so many hours of uh public service in a given time perhaps Uh I guess I see all of us benefiting and I don't see it just relegated to the young But I see so much going on that that's bad And this would give them a chance to have some positive self-esteem Something that they turn back That's right You take pride in that and get some positive feedback from those who benefit besides yourself And I see it being most beneficial if it's in at least the area where the person lives It might not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county because then you're coming in contact with it It's not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there that I'll never be able to see again unless I happen to go on vacation up there it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual on going But as far as putting that into work I don't want to deal with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics of it Yeah I see a lot of things like uh scouting uh Boys Clubs Girls Clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship uh the uh looking after the environment sort of thing And I guess I don't see uh this being that different But even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in and would take a turn in Do you have kids Oh well good you'll have a little time think about that I guess I have uh when I was teaching school I saw so many kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose And I can see you know some really significant things coming out of it I know you've got to get past that grudge attitude that many have but that would be a part of selling it to the community The adults uh ahead of it would probably never serve and to each succeeding generation There definitely would have to be a major P R campaign in each community each county  This is clearly 2 slash units Why wasn't it parsed that way  uh parish or however the state was divided up Um I may well I don't know around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for Boy Scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will uh police uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee- and I've seen it in other states too I don't know um and there were those  that said No you can't do that I'm sure Yeah Oh And I hadn't even thought about the other end of that that's an interesting uh situation I hadn't thought of that We had visited relatives in Virginia not too long ago and I thought I had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up and And I don't know about your part of the country but uh down here in the last oh year plus it was beginning with last year's Earth Day There's just been more of a turn toward uh environmental concerns and I work for Texas Instruments And they've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said Well it's not feasible it's not a good idea And I see that as being a change uh for the positive Kind of along the same line as the mandatory thing It's just a part of everyone's consciousness I'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way Uh there have been too many other things that it's done that for just in my life And if you look at history at all you see that you know uh we go from one side to the other on just about any subject that one might care to bring up But it is comforting to me to see uh more concern about some of these things that cost us money Especially when we have dwindling uh resources such as oil that's burning out of control in the Persian Gulf and so forth just every little bit does it makes me feel better it makes me feel like well there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth that's right because Uh no no because if we what was it seventy-four when we had the last oil crisis And uh we started getting smart and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth And as soon as the oil prices came back down the pendulum swang the other way And we need those reminders Uh or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say Oh my goodness now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology Ah Well I thi- you know just about anybody you could name whether I voted for them or not uh makes um uh decisions that I just can't go along with But that's why they're there and not me I don't want the stress
