to see them play the Indians or the Red Sox uh uh that's about it we do a lot of little trips around here uh and uh Not that much We've gone out to um uh a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water Uh have you ever heard of it Yeah it's really neat It's this house built on a waterfall and it's uh really cool Um of course we keep picking crummy weather to go out there uh the first time we went out there was uh the day after hurricane Hugo had come through So they didn't have any power and it was really cold and rainy and uh we went up about a year later and it was better but not a whole lot better So uh where else did we go uh <> we've gone to Richland last year and uh had a good time down there Uh my girlfriend has with her sisters but I haven't been down there Uh I hear that's nice We're going to get down probably down Norfork sometime this Summer just to catch a football game actually Uh spend a day and a lot of money Yeah I've heard uh I'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of the price attached to it We just we I Uh Uh yeah we'll do that Oh okay so I can wander around without Oh okay I just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings Oh okay I didn't know that Yeah I think uh they do the whole with you know paying they really did throw away a lot of money getting one thing or another but they had a good time so Uh uh Yeah I was uh we use it live in California and uh my um up around San Francisco and uh there was one year when uh my father's company was starting to do stuff down in Los Angeles so my father was working down in Los Angeles

like that we went down to Los Angeles so I went to Disneyland about five times in one year and I really have no great urge to go back now Oh it was great because uh well the times that were really fun were when uh we had vacation but the kids in Los Angeles didn't so we basically had one of the parks Uh there's still a lot of people at Disneyland but there was um another amusement park down there
