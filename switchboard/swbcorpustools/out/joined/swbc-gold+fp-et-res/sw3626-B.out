Yes Uh yes um we own one Uh its an Emerson eighty eighty-six um two low density floppy drives and no hard drive yet But uh you know it comes in mighty handy Uh yeah a big chunk of it's word processing We're also taking programming classes and uh so there's a fair amount of programming getting done on it But uh uh the uh right now we got a project going where we're trying to put uh all my wife's stray recipes on the disk Uh it came with a menus program but uh that doesn't it basi- both mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive and hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured Eighty eighty-six Which Uh impoverished college student This one went on a credit card and we got a way out while to pay it off yet So it's  B's next turn is not a continuation of this  Oh that's sounds nice slash error E D P Okay that sounds like fun job Yes Uh Computer engineering Well computer engineering technology uh which uh all I can understand is it's a slightly more hands on version of computer engineering But I've got a ways to go yet So far most of what I've done is getting core classes out of the way taken some electronics classes and one class um with computer logic Oh yes I enjoy it myself The uh lab for that uh computer logic class was a lot of fun Yeah we got to hook up a few uh counters and uh encoders Yeah I've not had a chance to work with it although um my uh data structures teacher was telling us something about how fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it Now how you'd implement that software wise or mechanically I don't know but uh it sounds like a very impressive piece of work Yes In the fuzzy logic direction Yeah Entering bad information of one sort or another and Yeah Uh-huh Uh yeah well what the C E T program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from you get a fair amount of programming you get hardware uh you get basic electronics courses that uh deal with you know not only the digital circuitry but uh you know power supplies and uh just the whole gambit but mostly towards uh computer electronics So the idea is that um you can go in a variety of direction from C E T major but I have more with the hardware than I do with the software so yeah so far I'm planning to go in the engineering direction
