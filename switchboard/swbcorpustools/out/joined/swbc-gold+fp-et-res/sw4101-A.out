Uh-huh Well here in Saskatoon uh much the same thing There is no curb pick up of uh any of the recycled products Uh we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people Uh there are areas where we could uh actually we have a couple of the uh handicapped societies types of places where the uh one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers so uh we are able to uh have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there's a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers Well primarily soft drink bottles and so we are able uh to take it to one of the uh rehabilitation centers and then they recycle the containers They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container and then Right primarily on soft drink pops and that kind of thing uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers Uh we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those So uh it's fairly extensive but then again uh it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city Well actually there's the opportunity for both Generally uh the handicapped group takes care of the things that actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to recycle the bottle so that you get your money back and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as well Oh yeah Uh I guess partly because of our climate Here in Saskatoon at least the majority of central uh well I want to say Central Canada but Central Canada tends to referred more to Ontario and Quebec but uh we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people We certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing Uh there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although uh scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds uh regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes They have done it some uh but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers They are actually at virtually all of the shopping centers Like the shopping malls There are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins and then the bins are collected Uh some of the
