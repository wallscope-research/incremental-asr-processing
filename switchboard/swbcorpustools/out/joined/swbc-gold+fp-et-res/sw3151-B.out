Well how do you feel about spot testing for drugs Uh-huh Right Yeah it's refreshing to hear somebody that has a similar opinion as mine all these people that are against it you know they may not even be on drugs they call it an invasion of privacy And I don't see that To me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for and I believe that they have the right to know if you're using a dangerous substance But Uh-huh Right Right Yes No I agree that you know there needs to be a well thought out sane approach to how to administer that program Just because something can get mixed in the mail or uh the chemicals could react incorrectly than what you would expect them to And yeah you know <> Right Yeah Right and you know I've the company that I work for uh has just well you know within the last couple of years instituted for all new hired employees they submit to a urine test And they say that they've also implemented random testing And it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that you know it's been in progress but uh I fully agree with it and you know there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy and I agree with you if you feel it's an invasion of privacy you've probably got something you're trying to hide Yeah Right Or  the quality of their product Yeah Uh-huh Right because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing to get the same effect Um and one of the few that they don't have a cure for Yeah <> Yeah Yes I do And I'm down in the central but I don't know how familiar you are with Texas but we live uh near a town called Temple Which is right in between Waco and Austin on the freeway Right We're probably about two two and a half hours south of him So Oh my actually we got about two inches of rain in about three hours yesterday And it's cooled things down somewhat It's getting more humid now but Uh-huh <> Yeah <> It's been about three weeks since we've had any Um Wow How about that Well I hope you do get some rain up there I <> Yeah I guess being in agreement kind of tends to limit the conversation you know One of the things I found interesting it's funny that you mentioned that T I is pretty much a worldwide company and we have manufacturing plants all around the world including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal Yeah they don't have to submit to drug testing like they do here in the States and some places abroad Yeah I thought that was kind of interesting too Yeah uh uh from a quality standpoint just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way Yeah Right Yeah but like if you're going to do business in another country you've got to respect their rules I mean you know that's the trade off Yeah Huh Right Usually with you life in some places That's right Yeah from the Middle East Yeah Iraq Iran in that area Yeah Well in Saudi Arabia you know using uh alcohol and drugs and something like that you get the death penalty So it's pretty strict over there Well people tend to take the first amendment out of context which means you know I could do anything I want to and you can't stop me and you know Yeah Yeah Yeah So that's I don't know I'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy
