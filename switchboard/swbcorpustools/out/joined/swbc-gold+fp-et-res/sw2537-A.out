Okay Well how do you feel about uh drug testing Yeah Yeah I am too a little bit I don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing and you know obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth but I don't really like having to do it It And I don't like the idea of it makes too much of a big brother type of thing Yeah Huh-uh Yeah yeah I think so too But you know it's one of those things Yeah Plus I guess if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time then the company has lost what they've put into that employee and their expertise or whatever Yeah Well do you think that um it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it Well you know if they have time enough they can stay off of it Yeah Yeah I think so too uh I know the group I was in at the time this all came up they uh were quite vocal about it through electronic mail boy they just really you know let them have it from one end to the other vehemently but uh it has quieted down but I don't think they probably feel any differently and some of them did quit the company True Uh-huh Yeah I wouldn't like anything of that nature you know don't tell me what to do you know Yeah Yeah Well I guess too if I thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem then that would be one thing But I think it's too minor and too you know in the whole scope of things this isn't going to have any real affect on what's going on in the street Yeah Well yes That yes I think that could be a big problem you know I would just be irate if they said it was positive and I knew it wasn't you know that just really rubbed me the wrong way Yeah Yeah Right No I guess the one that really got me too was that uh let's say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine that's not allowed You know that's totally out Uh-huh Oh that's interesting Well I guess we've exhausted that one enjoyed talking to you Good-bye
