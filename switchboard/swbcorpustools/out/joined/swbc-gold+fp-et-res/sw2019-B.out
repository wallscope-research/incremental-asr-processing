Uh yeah currently we have a poodle Yeah uh it's uh miniature Yeah Well um uh I definitely wouldn't dispute that it's actually my wife's dog uh I became part owner six months ago when we got married but uh it uh definitely responds uh to authority and I've had dogs in the past and uh it seems to uh respond real well it it she's picked up a lot of things uh just by uh teaching by force I guess is what I'd like to say Well about a year I guess It just turned two I believe Pretty much yeah yeah Okay Oh that sounds interesting Oh that's neat about how big then Yeah yeah Most definitely Yeah Oh I wouldn't doubt it yeah Well that's understandable yeah it's uh Uh-huh Okay Oh Yeah Okay Yeah definitely Yeah I can honestly say we do uh we uh just recently put a security system in our house and so now uh in order uh to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her uh uh locked up in the master bedroom during the day and then she's got the bedroom and the bathroom for free run during the day but we've always uh got a nose and tongue pressed up against the window when we come walking up to the front door She's definitely ready to get out and run around/ Really Oh wow Yeah Okay Okay Okay Most definitely Yeah yeah yeah that's uh definite security involved uh in a dog like that Uh-huh Wow Yeah that's interesting Yeah I know our dog has had uh some different reactions she's never really been around children and uh if the child is pretty straight forward um she's fine if a child is a little intimidated she'll jump around and yip and bark quite a bit and if the child gets scared uh she's still trying to play but she doesn't completely understand what's going on and we've had a little confusion with uh with younger kids But uh you know that's it's a matter of exposure really Um we uh took her home to uh my family's place in South Dakota and she was the one that was intimidated then There was about seven kids ranging from about uh three years to ten years running around the house all at one time you know come to visit Grandpa and Grandma and the dog kind of felt out of place then because she was being fed and everything else from all directions She really didn't know how to handle herself She really did she just uh she was just inundated with all the attention Uh she kind of sat and it all in for a little while and then she'd go get back in and try to play and what not but uh it was just such a new experience for her She's only been around one and sometimes two people at the most so uh Uh pardon Oh it's uh Mitzi Yeah Oh okay Yeah I see Yeah yeah yeah I had uh a similar uh experience I grew up on a farm so I always had uh outdoor pets and uh the dog I had when I moved to Dallas about five years ago was a uh Springer Spaniel black Lab cross And he was a real lovable type but uh definitely not an apartment type animal so uh he had to stay home Yeah yeah it really was He uh apparently had a tough time with it for a little while and then he came to accept the fact that Mom and Dad were his company from then on but uh Yeah Okay Most definitely Well that's great That sounds real good You too
