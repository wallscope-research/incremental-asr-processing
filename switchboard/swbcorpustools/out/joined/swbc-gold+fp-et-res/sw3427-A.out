Well what kind of car uh are you thinking of buying next You like the Chrysler products do you Do you really What year is it And why don't you like the Mustang I'll be darned Well you know the old sayings about Fords what they stand for There you go Well uh Well uh we've always had Oldsmobiles and uh been very uh happy with Oldsmobiles but uh my wife thought she wanted to get a Ford Mustang and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks her next car ought to be one of those uh Mitsubishi Eclipses She uh likes those She has a sister that lives in uh Phoenix that has one and uh really uh enjoys it Well uh what things do you consider when you buy a car I see Yeah especially when you're in high traffic areas and have to mess with that all the time That makes it very frustrating Now this is a LeBaron I sure like uh those rag top LeBarons they really look sporty Well uh we always this last Oldsmobile we bought uh it's an eighty-seven but we bought it in eighty-eight you know right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them and uh uh we found a real good interest rate you know when they're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that they really come down on their prices and uh uh you know we looked around at used cars and we really couldn't uh afford the payments on a used car because uh if you go to the bank and try to get a loan they want to charge twelve thirteen percent you know and we ended up I think with like a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car and the payments Well that's great Uh-huh Well when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door Our first car was an Oldsmobile back in seventy-seven It was a two door Cutlass Supreme and uh it just happened that when we looked for our new car they had a thing going with Oldsmobile and if you'd buy a new Oldsmobile they'd give you four hundred rebate because it was their seventy-fifth anniversary I belie- yeah seventy-fifth anniversary So in addition to everything else we got off the car all we had to do is show them our uh papers on our first car and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it So we got a four door this time and I sort of went more for uh the comfort factor and uh I liked the smaller cars but I'm a bigger person and I really like comfort you know driving along the road and stuff Yeah And if you try to take anybody you know go to the show or go out for supper and you go as a foursome
