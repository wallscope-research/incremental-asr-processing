Well this is kind of ironic because I work in T Is legal department And although we don't have any criminal actions here we do have other um lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time And uh when was it a couple weeks ago I was asked to go to uh jury duty I wasn't selected but um for some of our cases in particular we have um very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents and such And it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just you know happen to be selected in our jury to understand what we're talking about Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah you know some I don't you always have the option now in criminal I guess you always have a jury but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not Yeah and in some incidences I think they ought not to have a jury um Uh-huh Uh-huh Um Oh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah well um I've never fully served I've been asked twice to go down but I didn't get elected on the panel but I know that um for a lot of the civil cases it's rare if your a lawyer um there you could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the courtroom there's a lot of attorneys like that that never get to the courtroom their kind of law doesn't get them to the courtroom but even in um litigation which is doing lawsuits is a lot of times that you never get to the courtroom itself and Yeah But it's a shame that oh it's not so bad for the court system because the money there isn't being spent but there's awful lot of money in time and effort spent in preparing for trial only to then finally get scared enough by going to the court and usually it's the scare kind of the jury because you really don't know one way or the other how that jury is going to feel You could feel that you really have a very strong case and that you're very much right but the jury may or may not see it that way so you get a little you know anxious there and go well you know I don't feel that sure and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes you know the juries come down with a result and you go gee Uh-huh Um Oh really Uh-huh Yeah Oh really Yeah and it seems a lot of times uh especially in criminals that their rights are so protected but what about the rights of you know the rest of society we're protecting this person's rights who has broken the law um and we protect him so much but what about the rest of the society you know what are we doing for them we're kind of you know forgetting about them and I think sometimes that a criminal should kind of if he breaks law especially it he's a repeater the law shouldn't just always cover for him that some of his rights as should be taken Yeah Yeah Yeah Um Jeez Um Yeah I'd even go for trying to get some truth out of the witness stand if they come up with some pretty reliable uh um lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the truth Yeah you know Yeah I witnessed one trial many years ago when I was first um studying to be a paralegal and uh uh they barred priors on this uh person and they never then told us I guess because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other And they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other and the crime was uh uh attempt to commit murder you know but they never told us why these people were mad at each other and gee you know that's Yeah you know because they told us in school that you know crime has to be an intent you know has to be not just the act but you have to intend to do it because there could be accidental kind of things you know but they never told us why these two people hated themselves or if one had done something to you know really aggravate the other there was never any motive given and I had a tough time with that and being a person who saw what the jury didn't plus what the jury did because we were just observing you know there in the courtroom at the end of it all I still didn't know I still have a lot of reasonable doubts and I've seen everything presented and you know they just haven't a real complete case here to my thinking I don't know that I want to sit on a jury like that and you'd still you know I want ask some questions here Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Yeah allow them to uh go back and deliberate and uh you know after each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like the next day bring those people back Right
