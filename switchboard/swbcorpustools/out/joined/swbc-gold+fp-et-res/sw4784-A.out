Yeah I guess uh uh it's an easy one for me I think uh there's something seriously wrong yeah Uh uh I think they've lost their compass and uh I'm not sure they know exactly what uh uh public education supposed to be for anymore But uh I voted with my feet and uh my kids go to parochial school So uh Well one hundred percent of the uh customers care That's one thing Everybody cares about the education the kids are getting And uh they uh take an relatively active part uh if you're uh sending two thousand dollars that way every year you uh watch what goes on and you uh uh pay attention and participate and you can influence the way things are Yeah The immediacy just isn't there And uh uh I also think that one of the problems and actually I think this is a cultural problem The uh problem with public education is uh really a problem with the culture And I guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school and you can't get a tax levy passed Uh people are uh reluctant to pass uh school tax levies even uh when the money is needed or would be well spent because uh they don't have kids in the schools I think that's a loss of civic virtue and a loss of uh uh the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids I think uh that's the principal problem is that uh people no longer see it uh as their problem and there's an immediate problem Right Yeah Yeah You know I believe that the original idea of public education in the United States which I guess was controversial at the time of the constitution Uh you know it barely made it I think it was added afterwards I think the principal was uh education for civic participation The idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes Well that's exactly what I was going to say Now there seem to be really three reasons for education One is education for civic duty One is education for economic reasons And one is education for civilization and I think that one That's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor and then I quit and got disabused of that notion But uh uh uh now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is uh an economic enterprise to train people for jobs And uh I'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is And I'm really sad to say this I never thought I would have but I really think that uh the educational establishment has become part of the problem And uh that's why I guess I'm sort of reluctantly uh in favor of these uh choice programs Right That's what
