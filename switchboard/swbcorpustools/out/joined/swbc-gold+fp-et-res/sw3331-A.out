Well what I believe is one of the major uh things that is wrong with our public school system is that um we do not have enough discipline and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now Uh when I went to school I know I was scared to death about being disciplined and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different You know I did not see anybody in my classrooms when I was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom Yeah that's right that's right my daughter's in the um fourth grade and um there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom where the teacher cannot teach and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with Uh-huh Well they just don't do that any more But the school system's afraid of getting sued and um all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that And I also believe even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money put in toward public school And um I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that could solve some of our problems Yes supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for and you know we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not You know I don't know your feelings toward that I guess we shouldn't get into that um and what else um I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire I have heard stories uh from other parents that I know of their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs Oh yeah I've heard some horrible stories about high school teachers and you know to be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school Um that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system with what they have to work with I think they're doing a pretty good job right now Uh-huh so You don't have any children in school Don't have any kids Yeah okay so this is probably a real hard subject for you Yeah Okay well I guess um we can discontinue our call now It was a joy in talking with you Okay thanks Bye
