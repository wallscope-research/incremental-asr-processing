So what gets you Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I that's exactly the kind of thing I would have said Although in my case it's my wife and I both work we come home and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings and it's one solicitation call after another and you know Yeah it's like you say very annoying and uh why do we let this happen would you if you could legislate something what would you legislate Yeah it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't want to receive calls like that sv And the people making these calls would be obliged to compare their lists that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to be called Uh And that way those who want it can have it and those who don't want it don't have to have it Sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself Except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers Uh automatically and Right Yeah Uh-huh Yeah <> Uh-huh Yes and these people may in fact be just looking to find an unoccupied house to rob Uh-huh Yeah What about these telephone callers Sometimes they're door-to-door but usually they're telephone callers who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire two utts Well I think these people were hired from different sources Uh with you know and so therefore there's no one answer but yeah basically it's a market survey but they never say who they're really working for or what questions are you know Yeah <> Yeah Yeah <> Yeah <> Right well and sometimes this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too Other times it's you know wasting your time to collect the data they want for their marketing purpose For which if they would just pay me enough money I would be willing to consider but a dollar isn't it you know it's Uh and I also sort of worry you know that sometimes people giveaway personal information Uh when the call comes and they uh you know sort of seductive to you know somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things and so I start answering and then you know you go down a path uh and you don't know where it's going to end Uh slash error In fact you don't even know you know the totality of what you've revealed sv and you know slash error This isn't you know most likely not going to be used against you but it could And that seems to be something that should really be outlawed Because it's subject to abuse and it
