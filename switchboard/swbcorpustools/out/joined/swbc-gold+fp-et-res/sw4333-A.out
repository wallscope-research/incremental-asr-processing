Steve uh with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them or what do you think Uh-huh See uh I never really thought that the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little I always that the real question is are we getting a reasonable return on investment For instance like Social Security tax or Soc- uh that's tax we're paying money and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us So that's yeah you know when I see that money taken out of my paycheck every other week I really think that money's history and you know as far as return investment that's nothing and we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back Uh someone was telling me that uh uh there's still an office uh you know staffed with people there and in D C that are researching to find a cure for polio I may be wrong but I believe that the cure for polio is already founded but supposedly once you have an office in D C you know and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down and they just haven't yet Uh-huh Well that might be the difference I don't know Uh the other thing that uh I remember seeing on T V lately uh had to do with it's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically for some reason historical sites with you know the full federal money and everything seem to appear almost as like political favors to very strong politicians Uh-huh So it sounds like uh you think that we'd be able to save some money by uh passing the line item veto Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Pork barrel politics Yeah but Massachusetts when Dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially Uh-huh I don't know I it's tough there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations I guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and whatnot
