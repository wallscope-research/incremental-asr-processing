Oh Oh after our last summer's vacation I am antibeach Uh-huh We went to uh Cape Hatteras Well we were out visiting one of our kids in Maryland and we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days And uh uh the waves were huge I've never quite seen waves like this one and uh I was standing in water not more than barely above my ankles and uh you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles And I was standing there talking to my daughter and this really big wave came and totally threw me and one foot did not come out of the sand and it tore the ligaments in my knee So I'm never going to another beach again ever I'm ma- Well I love to go and play around At least I always did although actually I like the mountains uh I don't really like hot weather that's my biggest gripe about living here And I basically don't want to go to a hot place on vacation Oh my dream vacation is Alaska This is just someplace I've always wanted to go and someday I hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there Uh-huh Yeah I'd like that Uh I haven't been to Yellowstone for a long long time and uh we've been talking about going there next summer Uh I don't know we'll have to It's been a long time But you know it seems when your family is different places a lot of trips involved going to visit Oh I'm we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and I are both from And my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here And uh we've got one of our kids lives out on the east coast and so we have to you know go to those Well I know but I'm tired of them I want to go someplace different up there Uh my idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with uh money be no object You know so just absolutely you know first class fly where I want to rent a car if I want to Uh you know just really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and not worry if somebody says well let's take this little side trip you know and not have to sit there and figure out um you know again we fit that in there or not And uh um you know that's what I would like to do I have no interest for example in taking a cruise To me why somebody would want to ride around on a boat for a few days is mind boggling Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I just uh that does absolutely nothing for me But uh I don't know I can say that I think my favorite spots are still to go where there's mountains and a lot of trees and wildlife to view and uh I like that kind of stuff I could just sit there all day and look at the scenery Uh-huh Yeah Uh I guess I've never really thought about it that way Our uh we have a daughter who's almost thirteen but she's uh a very picky eater and our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is you know gee Holly would starve to death if you know we took her into the country but I would like if you know it was anywhere in the world to go I guess even though it's hot I would like to go to Africa
