Um I guess we're supposed to talk about music And uh let me go ahead and push one here Uh do you ha- are you a musician yourself Uh-huh Uh-huh Where do you sing in a choir or a choral group Uh-huh What kind of singing do you like to do Yeah uh-huh Um have you been singing a long time or have you studied Uh-huh Right Oh really Oh great did you do that in uh Texas or somewhere else Oh Whereabouts Uh-huh Oh that's wonderful Um well I likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs and then I didn't sing in a choral group um until after I was uh married and I sang in a couple of uh community choirs and then um waited for a while and now for about the last eight years I've sung in a church choir here in Texas And um so I enjoy just the chorals singing a lot as well Um are you a soprano alto or A soprano Yeah so am I Do you and uh what kind of music do you like to sing Um you were saying you had classical training Do you have a particular composer that you like or a particular type Uh-huh I've been listening to um uh some advertisements for MADAM BUTTERFLY and I'm wondering if you have ever done anything like that if you had done MADAM BUTTERFLY Yes Uh-huh yes uh-huh Um MADAM BUTTERFLY was um in Dallas it's been two or three years ago now and then I went to see that and it was really wonderful It was particularly well the acting was particularly nice I thought and um so it was quite popular Um you don't play um an instrument so uh um have you ever wanted to like guitar or piano or Yeah yeah I think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does you know some other kind of instrument I think piano is always good background beginner Um I played piano well I guess from the time I was five until I graduated from college and uh then I was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school so um that was the instrument both of my children started on but neither of them stayed with it One of them um turned into a violist and the other one the boy is um guitar and percussion so Um but the I think that the piano background is very um useful and um I'm sure that for you it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself just for practicing and so on Uh-huh Do you have any other kind of music that you like Uh-huh I have a I used to work with a fellow who had um although this was a computer company he had his uh P H D in musical uh I guess it was in composition actually from University of North Texas and uh yet when I would go into his office every now and then you never knew what kind of music he'd be playing on the radio It may be country it might be classical it might be rock you know it was just he said that just about what you said that he just liked all kinds of music And that was neat for me to hear that somebody is Yeah yeah Um do you have any plans to uh do anything with your music in the near future or Uh-huh Yeah I know that there are if you're interested in choral singing I'm not sure where you are in Texas but I do know that some communities have uh community choruses and uh that's often a good way to get back into it again Um it's not terribly demanding You might have to audition but that probably wouldn't be a problem but um there usually you know that they take tours and things like that and you get to know you know people socially as well as in a musical setting so that's always fun I think well that's one reason why I have enjoyed my choir so much is that not only do we sing wonderful music but we've gotten to know each other quite well um on a social level and I think we sing better because of that you know I think we sing more like uh people who trust each other which is really nice So whereabouts in Texas are you if I could ask Flower Mound okay Well I'm in Plano so um we're just not too far apart actually Uh-huh It was funny um uh it's you know I talk to people all over uh Texas {F um and only one person outside uh of the state so I'm always asking where in the state you know the person is from if they're in Texas Um do you have a family Uh-huh I was wondering if your spouse or you know if you had uh other musical people in your family Uh if you have other people in your family who are also musical Uh-huh Do you come by it naturally were your parents that musical Yeah yeah That often is the case um the you know sometimes it will skip Like my husband is not musical at all but his mother is very musical um and his children are very musical so you never know where the talent is going to show up I guess sometimes So um well I'm not sure how long we've talked I haven't been paying attention to the clock But uh I'll bet we've done at least five minutes Well I've enjoyed talking with you uh Becky and um maybe we'll talk again Uh-huh Bye-bye
