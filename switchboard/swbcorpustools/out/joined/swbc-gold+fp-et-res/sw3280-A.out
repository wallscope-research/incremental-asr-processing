Okay Um I very seldom read a newspaper I get most of my news information from T V Mainly um if I'm really wanting an in-depth thing I'll watch C N N And I find it one of the best And uh otherwise it's just one of the regular uh channels eight or five And uh where do you get yours Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS and my husband uh he reads it cover to cover And uh if he thinks there's something that I need to know about he'll say you know here you need to read this and uh I don't know it I kind of quit reading it oh several years ago when the kids were teenagers It just seems like I was so busy all the time and if I wanted to read I wanted to read something light and relaxing and uh things like that and so I coul- and it got so depressing Seems like it wasn't anything but bad news Yes yes I will pick up if there's something really gruesome in there I'll go through and read it Uh but I find that I do better with oh remembering it and everything if I watch uh the T V you know and they kind of capsize it and everything and watch and I think sometimes it's you know maybe a little biased you know i- something and sometimes you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts You know Yes Yes should be two slash units You found some members of your church that had been murdered Oh the same type of church Uh-huh uh-huh Oh uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh I used to uh or I didn't used to but uh when my grandchildren uh have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level And I thought that was very interesting and I thought that was very important for kids Like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on uh in the war they would bring it down to a child's level in words you know that they could understand what was going on And uh I noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that The oldest one he's nine and uh he would particularly enjoy this been a couple of years ago And uh I think that's really interesting Actually I even understood it better Yeah Yeah you know uh but as I said uh I ten- you know I have kind of a blas3e attitude about uh news and news reporting which is not good you know typo in word 8 Nobody should get that way about the news And what's going on in the world Yes We like channel eight We like it It's the best Is that been your favorite Uh-huh Yeah I very sel- and I thought it was very interesting uh channel nine watching it when the murders were in Killeen and going on They were having news coverage and No it was channel nine And you know they have that hour that nine to ten of an evening And so we had the T V on and we were trying to catch all of it and they were showing some and I was watching my husband and I were watching it and then we switched over to channel eight and the difference in coverage was unbelievable I can understand uh you know why they're kind of behind Did I say channel nine to begin with No Okay No channel eleven I meant I was thinking nine to ten But channel eleven Uh-huh It uh but the coverage wasn't near as good as when we you know switched over to channel eight and they didn't e-
