pretty good pretty good So we're talking about drug testing in the work place huh listen Yeah we have random drug testing in my business but I've uh never had to do it Yeah yeah they started that about a year ago and I think it's mostly for the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff But uh they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time at least that's Pardon Yeah yeah they'll check for alcohol No once you start doing that stuff you're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole thing Yeah it's a I'm in the oil business Yeah Yeah I work in the office so uh it's pretty safe environment Uh-huh uh-huh Well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on Yeah yeah well I agree I think that uh you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in high risk uh uh industries where you can really hurt other people that you need to have that kind of stuff You know if it's as long as it's not abused uh you know random you know as long as it's random and the individual's rights uh are protected I don't have that big a problem with it Well see this is it this is where I start having my problems with my company I work for a private company and the policy is something like see if I can state this correctly now If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling But if they catch you if you test positive for a controlled substance then you get fired So you know it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos Yeah really it's one of those things that you read once and then if you're not worried about it you just forget about it Yeah Yeah yeah our company's a little tougher on the second chance if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to you know go out of the way I think a little bit more uh to help get you rehabilitated you know to get back at your job But uh when you're a private company the rules don't always apply Well it's hard for me to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment and you know it's not I guess I haven't run into anybody that's been a problem Uh so you know I guess it works uh much uh well shoot like any lottery everybody's got an equal chance to get picked So uh I'd rather have that than you know say well this week the As and Bs are going to be in and next week Cs and Ds are going to come in Yeah right right Yeah Well especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff You know I've gone out and had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case Uh I don't remember to tell you the truth I don't think they do Um well they must gee whiz That just shows you how much I've been paying attention because I really don't know I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask Well you know you can take some of that testing a little bit too far Uh there was a company in Houston they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of their company oh it was an unannounced sweep of it was not only drugs
