Well it's hard to say I mean while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories uh pollute a lot uh if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano uh it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all What do you think Uh-huh No I'm more out in the suburbs but I certainly work near a city How about you Uh-huh Oh I see Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah You mean like from the coal Um Yeah I notice locally a major problem is Kodak Um it's interesting because in order to uh keep with the E P A standards which which tend to be visible uh what's coming out of your smokestack they do all their emissions at night Uh so people get up Yeah people get up in the morning in that neighborhood and they've got this black ash on their cars which you know seems to be Yeah I mean I really think that if the E P A had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and uh you know Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Right Yeah yeah Yeah That seems a little ridiculous Oh they've been getting cleaner Sure But um yeah I'm not sure how much the water pollution is is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain yeah I mean the stuff I've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit uh overstated That a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all Um ye- I'm not an expert {F Um} I haven't read that Oh yeah Uh-huh Yeah that's interesti- Uh-huh Um Well that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article So that They didn't say what they just said they thought acid rains contribution may be less than was previously suspected Um that it may be other natural things at work Um Yeah so it's it's less than clear Like I said I don't remember the article that well But um I don't know I mean what do you think we can uh I guess as individuals or as a group do about uh air pollution <> Uh-huh I think it's up to individuals too to ask automakers for for less pollutant vehicles Yeah Uh-huh Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem I mean I remember reading an article that said like it's uh the older polluters the the twelve and fifteen year old cars you know contribute like ninety percent of the automobile pollution and the new cars it's hardly is hardly anything Yeah but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune Right But diesel engines It you know it's it I mean they do generate a lot of soot but that at least that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly Yeah On the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's so inconvenient Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah sure Well what do you think about like a device a meter right on a tail pipe and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted Well it just means if you don't pollute right or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax or you just buy one of these things and it it uh maybe you you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe and uh the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe and you couldn't start your car anymore Yeah but uh you know it's uh I guess the difficulty would be to that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something Right You could take ca- but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off Right But if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that uh busses and any kind of vehicle had to pay a pollution tax uh this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters Yeah patent it that's a good idea Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah the automobile regulatory agencies or something Uh-huh
