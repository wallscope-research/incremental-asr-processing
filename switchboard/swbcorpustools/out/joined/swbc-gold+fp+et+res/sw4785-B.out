kids too Oh you laugh How many what ages Uh You've been through the fun part I have a four and a half and a three So It's I I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way in the way it's done now and then Yeah Yeah What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest So they were all real close That's tough That's a lot of time Did you both work Your wife too Uh well qualify that She worked at home I'm sure But that's uh well both my husband and I work and sometimes I feel like you know by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed I have very little time each evening Maybe thirty minutes max And well he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking and then I spend time with them while you know he's doing other stuff And and of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend You know there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it but it's neat it's straight and I can live with it because I do stuff with my kids you know Well I've accepted that too That's true It is Yeah That's true Well that's true and and we do a lot of that on the weekends you know We try to spend Saturdays together If my husband golfs you know he'll do it during nap time things like that where they're not really missing the presence you know And and we do a lot of family things together We're we're kind of going the other direction this weekend We're planning a trip just he and I This is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago Well I decided that you know you need that once in awhile That you you need to plan the quality time and and I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty-four hours a day Yeah Sure Sure And they think that's a family activity you know Yeah That's great fun My daughter's like Mommy can I help you with the laundry Of course you can Absolutely Yeah Uh-huh And what would you do what Oh Yeah So they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week and then Oh I imagine And I imagine you still have a very close relationship with them I Oh that's wonderful See I was raised in that type of family where you know you don't disobey me you mind me but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it Yeah Uh-huh Uh well Yeah yeah You don't think of it that way do you Now that's good I like that idea Whatever was voted on huh Well I think that's great Yeah Yeah I I think that's true I can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment And we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done you know So I do think it's right that they're harder on themselves you know Oh why is that
