All right Uh exercise huh Uh as a matter fact I work out in the mornings I belong to Presidents And uh I have got a routine for every morning of the week and I don't work out on Saturday or Sunday but uh I do I do a combination of uh uh running and weight training No I uh actually I just uh joined on my own and I have been thinking about getting with a uh one of their counselors just so see what uh they might have to offer as far as uh alternatives But I pretty much uh worked on my own routine They have got the track on the inside And uh I run one mile on Monday Wednesdays and Fridays and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays I run two miles And then after that I work out with weights Uh I work out with free weights Oh uh yeah It is really the uh aerobic work out part Uh about seven minutes Uh no I do Yeah that is that is a pretty good clip and I am pretty winded by the time I get done So Oh yeah I I uh could probably go faster but then I would wear myself out And I wouldn't be able to work out anything else Yeah How about you Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Oh I see So this uh do you just try and keep them I guess uh firm and uh Yeah uh that is true Yeah Oh I see Oh I see Uh so you are in uh in part of a band Oh I see I see I use to play an instrument when I was in high school but it wasn't the trumpet So I was just wandering if that was what it was or something I think So do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I use to do a little bit of jumping rope uh when I was uh well a while back I was more into basketball and uh I could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves And uh but it has been a while since I have done that Right Right Uh-huh Yeah I I uh that is true I have noticed that uh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Huh That is interesting though Uh I have been thinking of changing uh I have done the same routine for almost two years now and I am thinking of uh changing it up Uh that is why well you know I was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to uh get out of the routine Because I have heard that you know you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing So I am looking at changing things a little bit Uh-huh Yeah
