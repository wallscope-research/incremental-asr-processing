Um there was a crime here in McKinney uh a rather heinous murder There was no um remorse shown by uh at least one of the perpetrators And yet for whatever reason um his crime was not considered a capital crime An and quite honestly I I feel very strongly that the man ha- the has no redeeming social values and if if and when he comes gets free again he will have no compunction but to complete that that same kind of lifestyle I mean continue that same kind of lifestyle and perhaps do the same thing again So it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever That's that's right But yeah Did you Uh-huh Yes but my concern is first of all that not all all persons who I think should be receiving capital uh whatever capital uh tha- uh th- uh hum punishment thank you I'm sorry I just got home from work and I'm just kind of spaced out a little bit Uh that not all of them are being convicted of it that that the the they're not even being charged with that appropr- I agree with you that that a person's heart can be changed but the same God that can work that miracle also established the laws that said um for certain kinds of <> sin certain kinds of of uh breaking of the law there would be a capital punishment Right then it was it was uh almost immediate As soon as as the trial was over then it was stoning We don't have a speedy trial we don't have speedy um punishment and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth That's correct Uh-huh I tend to agree on that very strongly Plus the all the judicial system is overloaded with all kinds of um problems and crimes and so forth and then all of the um civil things that clog the courts and having sat on both uh uh criminal and a civil uh jury some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time Because we're suit happy But but back to the to the capital situation sounds like you and I have a lot of of of uh common ground at least as as far as as capital punishment is concerned I would like to see some some kind of reform or some kind of streamlining so that if a person is um convicted and sentenced to to death that that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with And and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family r- r- any of us the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years An an bu- him could be a her But Um That's sad Yeah However certain uh very liberal minded groups who do not um subscribe to the same ethical system that you and I do such as the uh civil liberties unions and so forth will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath Which is most unfortunate because we all lose out when people go so far out to the extreme on either side Because too too often they're can be extremism that that hurts from from any direction regardless of wha- whatever you're arguing or concerned about Yeah
