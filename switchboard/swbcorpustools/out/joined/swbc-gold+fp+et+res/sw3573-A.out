Okay well All right Um um well uh tell me about the car that you've got Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that's very interesting I've had I've had exactly the same experience with the one that I've got It's a and surprisingly it's also an eighty-four and uh Yeah I'm still here Um I'm sorry what Yes it's an L X it's not a hatchback but it's um it's uh Four door yeah and very very comfortable car Big roomy trunk uh and uh and very happy with it and I must admit it's you know if if if uh my only consideration were were you know buying another car just to tool around town in and make you know brief trips and things like that I would very very seriously consider buying one Uh I think they're extraordinarily reliable cars Um my my real concern with uh uh why I'm not sure I want to buy a Honda is because I have to make a kind of a a steady um trip down the road about once a month because I'm divorced and I have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina and uh I drive down Interstate Ninety-five and it's just an absolutely wild highway Yeah and Uh-huh And you well you've got it and uh so having precious cargo in the car with me as you can well imagine it's very hard for me to imagine that that uh a Honda's going to be as safe a car as as the one that I've got my eye on which is a Volvo In in fact quite frankly I've owned a Volvo in the past and uh I've I've they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service but uh I've found that I've had a lot of luck with them Uh course I'm a mechanically inclined kind of person and I always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that you know need to be taken care of and so forth And I guess that's one thing that that recommends the Honda to a lot of people is is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood and uh Oh I know It's really amazing It's uh Absolutely incredible So um yeah anyway I've been looking at the prices of these cars and and so forth and I think that it's it's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to buy ones that are about the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own and um Well certainly some of the top end ones You can still get get uh even the the low end wagons um for less than twenty thousand dollars and uh we get you know in the Washington area of course being as affluent as it is there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any any week and I sort of you know scan the paper and look at them and so forth and so um anyway and that's that's the other thing is that I've I've never really been too terribly much of a new car person I think I've bought one or two new cars in my life and I've tended to um to uh buy cars that are you know two or three and sometimes even four and five or six years old This Honda that I have I bought used and in fact it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it I've just rolled seventy thousand miles and it's a seventy-four I mean an eighty-four So Yeah
