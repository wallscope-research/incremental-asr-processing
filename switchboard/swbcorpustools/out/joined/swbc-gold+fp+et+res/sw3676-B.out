Uh it's been probably a month or so since I've been to the movies Course my my favorite now is is DANCES WITH WOLVES Uh SILENCE OF THE LA- uh of the LAMBS was good Uh-huh Oh it's a I guess it's a mystery you'd call it It's with uh Jodie Foster And it uh it's pretty good Another one that I think I really liked was uh THE FISHER KING Right How about you What are you Yes Right That was that was an excellent movie Have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES What'd you think of it I don't think I can see it enough times Course I'm a Kevin Costner fan No but you know it wasn't a bad movie It got such bad reviews really and and I thoroughly enjoyed it But I then I wasn't expecting any classic either I thought so Have you seen THE FISHER KING Uh it you you know I guess it it really isn't for everybody It's it's pretty deep and uh uh philosophical But I thought it had a wonderful message to it It's the kind you came out and looked at somebody and said You know I think I liked that And then the more you got to thinking about it the more you thought You know I did like it But when you first came out you weren't real sure Haven't seen that Oh yes I did yes I did Uh the nanny type Housekeeper uh-huh I saw one the other day that was A KISS BEFORE DYING Uh-huh I had not heard about it when it was on the movies but was out on video And it's with Sean Young And it's a it's a mystery It was very predictable I mean you knew you knew when the murder was going to happen or something but it was still so well done that it was enjoyable That's right I had uh uh I like the I think it's called the uh RAZOR'S EDGE but no no the JAGGED EDGE the JAGGED EDGE with uh
