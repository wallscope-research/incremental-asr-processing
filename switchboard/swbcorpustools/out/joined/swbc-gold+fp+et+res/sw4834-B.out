No not really Uh u- th- uh th- the only thing that annoys me is when uh people call and they uh you have solicitation calls That's the only thing that bothers me That's not really invading my privacy Uh <> do you feel that yours is invaded But but that doesn't work Uh no because they a lot of times they dial sequentially They get your name from uh if you enter any type of contest or anything Uh you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something you put your phone number on there they pass your phone number on to another company Uh or you uh or or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or s- and stuff They even call the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe And uh while I was subscribing to the paper I got so upset at them that they you call me one more time I'm going to stop subscribing And the lo- local local papers ask them to remove your na- number from their list and uh yeah you call up their regular during regular hours their uh they have a special department they'll take your numbers out of their lists Uh but the uh Orlando paper uh yeah they they refused to take it off of the lists and they call every month And when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh If you know a person's social security number and their mailing address i- and their mother's maiden name uh you can basically become that uh person Uh if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to and since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove you know that it wasn't her Uh if it was some you know coming into the store and stuff then she would ha- whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of uh you know document and uh wh- the signature uh they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature and if they can't provide a signature you know they'll have to eat the charge But if the pers- has you know their social s- her social security number I'd be real concerned that they uh that she's not uh blacklist on uh Tel- what is it it's Telecredit or something Uh because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there She probably won't be ab- able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle
