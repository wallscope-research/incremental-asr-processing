I you know actually in this modern day and age it seems like uh uh we have more and more leisure time because uh we have so many convenience appliances and whatnot We don't even have to cook dinner anymore Uh but I uh I've heard I don't know this for a fact but I've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together That ki- the kids maybe on the average get uh something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents It seems bizarre to me I don't quite understand it although I think probably the the worst thing that's happening in the world at least the modern world today is television Not so much because uh it's bad per se although there is some pretty crappy programming and I thin- there's also some uh I think uh poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time It's so darned easy to turn the thing on So I refuse to have one in the house Yeah Uh-huh Well I'll tell you Television sure makes child rearing easy on you I mean the kids can be a real pest uh and turning the T V on is almost like magic you know it's like sticking uh an electrode into their pleasure center and you don't have to worry about them But I don't think it's too good Uh so you know I don't know I take advantage I don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids but I take advantage of um dinner time We always eat together and you know whenever you're with your kids you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them Uh I guess our big outlet is music Uh our thirteen year old son plays violin and our nine year old daughter plays cello and uh when our son started playing violin I took up violin and when our daughter started playing cello I took up cello So there's plenty of plenty of interactive time in uh practicing Although neither kid likes to practice I guess that's not a big surprise But I mea- I imagine with infants you are most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them Although Oh you know reading is so good I uh I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little and I still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore Uh but I read you know there's this DOCTOR SEUSS sleep book Have you ever seen that yet Yeah it's called a sleep book and uh you ought to get it I tell you I read that book to my kids so many times I almost have the thing memorized Uh Yeah Well I think I think his sleep book is my favorite Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh So how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day Oh that's great Oh I see Ho- how old are your kids again Two and one Yeah so you have your hands full with them that's for sure
