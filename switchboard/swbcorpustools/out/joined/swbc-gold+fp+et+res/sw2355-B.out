The war You mean in terms of the economy or Oh I thought we were going to talk about social changes Is that is that what you're kind of directing it Oh okay Okay well Um Well I think it's caused a lot of you know big difference between when people had gone to war before like compared to Vietnam because I mean I know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that you know and support the soldiers so Yeah Yeah yeah Yes it would be like a bonus for your image or something Yeah it I'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income just drastically altered We had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a just had a new baby and uh they would have she would have had to go back to work and I think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds Yeah yeah I think the biggest change that we've seen um in in my life or whatever lately is the economy and things are so tight and like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years and you know Yeah Even dog licenses I mean Yeah Yeah Going to effect too many Yeah yeah So that's the hardest thing for us and um we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home We have a three year old and a two year old and I'm trying to stay home as long as I can but you know every week it gets harder because I could go out and be making money you know so that's a big uh stress I think you know for the social changes in our family Oh I see Uh-huh Yeah yeah Well i- Yeah you have an inside track or something Yeah yeah Let's see what other social changes in the past ten years oh I guess between men and women I've seen a lot of changes in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career be mom be everything superperson Yeah because I know you know I I really get pressure from because I have a career also and I get a lot of pressure from people that you know my colleagues that why am I staying home You know whereas before that never would have happened people would have said why are you going to work So that's kind of a difference for us I think there's more pressure to um not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family So he's Yeah he's gotten a lot uh you know you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all but in terms of his amount of hours at work nothing on that has lightened up So it's now he has the pressure too of being superdad and supercareer and Yeah that's true MISTER MOM and Uh-huh Yeah yeah That's true Yeah Yeah I think there's still I I know that um I grew up in Chicago in the sixties and was part my family was real liberal and I think there's a lot of um kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society and race relations and things like that and you know I think there's so much prejudice still there and it's kind of more covert now People used to be more clear and say you know well I believe in this or I believe in that and now you know I think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice but people think oh we're in the nineties we're beyond all that you know Yeah yeah Yeah But there's so many more people that are homeless and Yeah Yeah It's real easy to get isolated in your own little community you know because wh- when I was growing up in Chicago um we were in a real ethnic neighborhood and there were people from all first generation Chinese German you know all different nationalities and everything And now we're kind of like in Lewisville Miss White Little suburbia you know I mean I don't even know anybody that you know from any place other than Texas hardly you know Oh boy Yeah Yeah Oh Yeah Yeah Yeah and they they think the whole world is like that We lived in a dorm My husband and I met in graduate school at Indiana University and I was ours was uh international co- you know co-ed dorm and there were twelve hundred students they're graduate students from all over the world And once we came here it was like gosh I just miss that because it really is exciting to be around people of different cultures and different backgrounds We got invited to one guy practically roasted a goat in his in his dorm I wonder if he was from Iran or some place I don't know where but um you know Yeah yeah Oh uh-huh Oh Yeah yeah Oh God Yeah yeah Yeah really That is part of the change I think that I've seen probably you know in the past twenty years or whatever is now kids have to have so much I mean I even get caught up in it with our kids even though I buy most of the things at garage sales for their Christmas I mean people ha- you know think they're kids have to have five hundred dollars worth of toys Oh yeah it's just it it's Oh gosh Yeah me too in Chicago I didn't even date a guy that had a car until I was in college Yeah Yeah Yeah Oh gosh my kids are going to be hating me I'll give them a bike and say here's it so you can afford to pay the insurance you know Yeah no kidding Yeah Well did we cover it everything Betty Okay I guess I'll get back to my laundry You too good luck Bye-bye
