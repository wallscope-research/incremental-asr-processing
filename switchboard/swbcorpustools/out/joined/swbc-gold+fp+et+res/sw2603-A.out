Okay Um I guess what I guess my task I usually ride my bike I have uh a stationary bike and uh a regular bike And when I can I like to ride my regular bike outside because it's so much nicer The stationary bike is is so uh boring But I have head phones and I plus I have it uh in the living room so I either watch T V or we have a fish tank so I watch the fish you know Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied If I like to have the T V on because that usually keeps me um more occupied It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize really that's really the only time I ever watch T V is when I'm on the bike But and then usually after I'm done riding the bike just to cool myself down I usually take a walk you know and that just kind of gets myself uh gets me you know to where I'm not quite as tired I guess But it's definitely a task I can't say that I really enjoy it I wish that I did enjoy it more but I do it because I have to not because I want to Yeah yeah Uh-huh Really So is it just women that go there See I think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place uh a a health club Because I don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise You know so I have tried to just do stuff at home and uh I just feel conscious about it I mean I'm not big you know or anything but I still don't like other people watching me Yeah Right Uh-huh That's what Really That's that's great How Do they have a pool or what is Huh I've heard that that's really good for you to do Uh-huh Uh-huh So you don't really feel like you're really working that hard do you When you're in the water Oh wow Well that's funny I never would have thought of that Like wat- Are they water shoes Is that Oh okay okay Okay okay Huh that's really funny Huh that's So how often do find yourself going Um on a if you're doing it on a regular basis how often do you go Yeah That's really Really I wish that I could make myself exercise every day But I do force myself to do it at least three times a week Which I don't feel like is enough but i- it's it's at least something You know it it I just force I have to force myself to do it like I said because to me I really don't enjoy it But I know that I have to do it I mean it's just it's it's not a question of whether I want to you know But Uh-huh Oh that's Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Did you ever Well I'm sorry Uh did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for T I Did you ever try that Oh okay Um Then that would yeah I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you wouldn't it Oh Wow Uh-huh Yeah Oh Wow What if you're already on one I mean Yeah I mean when you go in there they wouldn't make you do theirs Would they Okay But they have packages where they just offer the exercise program Is that what you're saying I see okay Um Um Wow That's Oh Yeah That would be really nice Uh-huh Uh-huh So you really do enjoy your exercise then since your Uh-huh That's you know I wanted I wanted to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike but I got talked into the bike instead And I don't know I really wanted a stepper I'm considering maybe even buying one of those too But I'm not sure if I'll get benefit out of both of them I mean I don't know if it would really do any good having both of them Which one do you feel is better since you use them both Uh-huh Huh Uh-huh Oh really Um Uh-hum Uh-huh
