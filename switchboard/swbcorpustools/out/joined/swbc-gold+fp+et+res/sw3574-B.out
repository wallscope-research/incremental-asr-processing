We we we have a terrible air pollution problem Our summers are extremely uh hazardous and during uh certain wind directions because we get the uh Gary Indiana Chicago pollution and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze uh coming up along the lake And they do post uh uh warnings for people who have uh heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season In the winter it's not as severe But uh if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad Uh the State of Wisconsin as a matter of fact uh started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting Uh I don't think it's going to go very far but it it was uh a way of uh triggering uh awareness So what's the conditions like in Dallas Um Wisconsin has a a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for uh their pollution control equipment and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it it is drivable So they've they've tried to do a lot of that and I thi- you know there seem to be at least in certain little pockets and we were talking earlier about Madison Madison has one of the nicest uh bike uh road uh sharing programs of of any city in Wisconsin and all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of uh bike trails for recreational use of any of the states And there is a a real promotion of of biking but um there are still a lot of people who insist on on driving their own automobiles uh to go everywhere I find that a little irritating because I don't think it's always so necessary Send send them to Wisconsin and we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from uh the uh acid rain and they'll they'll they may wake up you know how'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain It's uh really a serious issue for those of us up in this uh sector up up here I think it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of of the Gary area and uh I don't know exactly where it emerges from when it it's up in the uh northern sectors of Wisconsin slash error with b70: one utt that causes the acid rain That I'm a little uncertain of but I do know that uh it is a problem
