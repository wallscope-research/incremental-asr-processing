Okay Well um I used to work in a day care center I worked in um in all the different areas of the day care center and it is they can be deceiving to people I did not work there long because I couldn't handle the the treatment that the children got and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three um centers all over you know the um city and they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left So um I think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks and um to check in on them when they're not expecting it Because they do do things differently when you're not around so Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Well this one was set up good I mean they had two teachers to every room Um sometimes three And they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough They did not show them care to these small children who are being left Um they one time I picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other You know he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up And I said no this child was crying and needed some comfort you know what is your problem So um Yes Right They did they had like um the the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room The ones that were starting to walk in one room Then they had like the um three three year olds upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives You know just like that You know they really did separate them well It was just the teachers themselves Right But yeah that they're not Yeah Their system Right But their but their system was was great but um the you know the caring just wasn't there The one woman that taught that did the babies I worked with her and she was fabulous She loved them babies and she loved them and cared for them But um every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and um you know would make me a nervous wreck so you know Yeah these kids are just in a day care center all day and uh with no any type of emotional you know getting love getting care they're just there You know Going through this routine which is lousy Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah you don't see that much That's cute Yeah that has to be with a day care center I've never heard of that That's that's a new one on me Uh-huh
