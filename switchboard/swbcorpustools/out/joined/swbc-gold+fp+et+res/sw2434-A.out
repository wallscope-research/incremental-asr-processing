Well I don't know I've I've had mixed emotions I guess when I listen to uh the radio and and watch T V about the different uh things that are happening Uh I'm against it but on the same token uh I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to do that So I I have a rifle in the house Uh the ammunition is probably so old I'm afraid to use it But uh I bought it for target practicing and uh and also because I wanted a weapon Uh how do you feel about it Huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well up uh up in New England where I'm from uh you had to get a permit before you could buy any amu- am- ammunition And I thought that was really good And I think if they uh takes two weeks for that system to process uh your request for uh not as a gun permit but uh but to buy ammunition You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that Yeah Uh I I I agree I think you know one of the things that that that needs to happen is uh to to stop the impulse buyer from uh buying it quickly and and uh maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it But if someone's really determined to to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place And you can get them really cheap Uh-huh How long was the waiting period out there Huh That wasn't too too bad Because if if you're going to go buy something uh uh of that nature I think you you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it You're not going to react that quickly In other words you know you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day Yeah I do too Uh because it doesn't make any difference uh uh whether it's a pistol or a shotgun I suppose They both do the same kind of job Uh yeah I suppose I never got shot with either one But I don't know uh I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun Yeah Uh-huh Oh Uh I've got a manual single shot and I guess it doesn't have any any automatic features to it The further away I get the the uh wider the shot gets from the target And the closer that I get the tighter that it gets It's got a hell of a kick to it Do you belong to a gun club or you Uh-huh No kidding Huh Well the the uh clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive but uh it's well worth it You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have uh competition Uh I've never really joined a club because I haven't got the time Not because I haven't got the desire Uh there's an annual membership fee uh that's that's fairly high Plus there's ini- an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time uh uh member So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club Plus you have to pay for the the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in Uh-huh I think that that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose In fact I'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to uh show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon And you know it it even after you wait your nine days if you don't know how to handle it it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive And you give him a license because he waited nine days He could he could not only uh uh shoot himself He could he could uh mishandle a weapon Leave it at home and let a child get at it Wow He was fortunate He could he could of hit something else Wow About uh private citizens selling a weapons Like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me How do you feel about that Do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the uh buyer and the seller And or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system uh because you own it Yeah I- isn't there a way to uh to deregister yourself after you register a gun Because I have Yeah Is it registered The uh the rifle that I've got is not registered and uh I don't know why I never registered it but the uh Um I I think it's it's voluntary The uh the Yeah Yeah I guess that could happen It's just like the uh the social security system Once they uh they gave everybody a number and now they're making you uh uh get one at at birth And once they have your number they have your identification And if you try to do anything uh like uh not identify yourself to the government they know who you are And that's true That's all right You you were talking about uh uh Fed- what the Federal government knows about people They probably do Yeah Uh-huh Do you find it difficult picking up uh guns that that are not registered No I don't either I can I can buy some uh today if I wanted to Just you know put up the money Uh-huh Yeah And there's there's no waiting period on that To sell the refrigerator Yeah Huh And I think the Federal government is uh is really far away from uh uh control I I don't believe in uh I'm s- I shouldn't probably say control I mean regulation Control is something that I wouldn't want the Federal government to have Uh but I would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons Yeah Unfortunately we uh we vote for the the people who spend the money so I can't complain too much
