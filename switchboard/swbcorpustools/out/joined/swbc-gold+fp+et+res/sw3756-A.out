Okay have you painted something lately Yeah Oh yeah another bedroom Yeah Yeah Yeah Oh yeah Oh heavens Well I painted the outside of my house and one bathroom But I get I have that problem with the the ceiling you know the uh the blown blown ceiling You know where you get around the edge Uh-huh Uh-huh Well how do you get the edge though The the straight edge Oh I see Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh Well are you going to paint the outside of your house too Oh really Oh nice Yeah Uh-huh Oh that will be nice Huh Or two tone or two tone You know Uh-huh White But I have a problem I can't get up high and we can't paint the chimney We have one of those ladders We are just not willing to get up that high Well we did too We did it in the fall and it it's just too high It is really scary but and the only thing I would consider doing a professional maybe doing that but it other than doing our own work I prefer it to a professional Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh The blowers Oh oh oh oh I know what you are talking about Uh scaffold That's it Huh Its Yeah Oh my So that was worth it getting a professional for that Oh I think that is what we might have to do with this chimney but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself It wasn't too bad I mean you think Shoot maybe a hundred and fifty Since it is a one story but we did uh like two heavy coats over it But then that way you know you are assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh My word Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh my word Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh my word So that was really worth it Painting his own house Oh my word Oh my word Well he really saved in that way But yeah I think we are going to do uh another bathroom but I think I will probably just do it in a roller I want to do it about the same color And just be a little Oh I know But it's that it's the textured wall
