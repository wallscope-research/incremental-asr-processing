Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh They set that up for you Uh-huh And uh what kind of running do you do Uh-huh Uh-huh Is is just aerobics or No uh I mean the running You do it you do a mile in about eight minutes or less Uh-huh Yeah Then you wouldn't then you don't get uh out of breath Oh Oh But I mean it's not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make six or something like that Right Uh-huh Yeah I I don't run much any more I did when I was in school Right now I just lift uh weights and do push ups and sit ups and and I uh jump rope a little bit and that is about it And I don't I don't lift any heavy weight uh they are about a third of my body weight Yeah and uh uh I play the trumpet and the uh the more upper body strength the easier it is to play You have to do a whole lot of sit ups and uh and then uh I hurt my neck uh about three years ago So you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from uh hurting yourself when you play high You have to you have to do it correctly you know it is like an exercise in itself but a lot of people uh strain themselves doing it Uh I play at Church Yeah Uh-huh Well yeah uh well the weather is nice except for when it rains you know I mean in Dallas Yeah I keep thinking about it but that doesn't mean it gets done I I mostly jump rope more You know Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I do a toe lift and squats for that But you know it it  doesn't uh doesn't  uh accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you are running for a long time They tend to tighten up whenever whenever you have to do something at uh uh great length of time And it also builds too much mass if you just you know So it is like I I lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do the squats with And uh then it doesn't bother me very much Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah that is uh I have started doing more push ups and and it has helped a lot and then I add sets to it so that I don't like you said wear it out I don't try to push it so the end in one set
