Go ahead Uh no I haven't But in my job I'm a nurse and we are allowed to be I mean you know this is the rules that they can do this anytime Uh I don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested They can if they choose to Right Have you well wai- have you had any experience with it at all Uh-huh So what do you think about that Right right See I know of that too And I also know that things like antihistamines Sudafeds things like that can really throw it off And you cannot get a job because of it and they may not tell you the reason why slash error Uh-huh See and so it really is a dangerous thing that way because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job and they weren't told why But a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing or they would tell you Or this person never use any drugs Uh you should Because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something I have real mixed feelings about it I don't know The accuracy I don't know I don't know But I know there are a lot of things that can influence them and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time And if you could show that I I interviewed for a job recently and I was taking Entex And my doctor gave me a prescription for it And he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you you know And it didn't come up that I needed to do it but this could happen to anybody and if they would just say oh this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them you know Then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything So I don't know Yeah I'm not sure either The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it because they say they can spot check Yeah Well it sort of is And this is it this I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways You know as a health professional I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs You know so as a patient I feel well yeah we probably should be protected But on the other hand there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too So you know I guess you sort of you have to have trust some place along the way You can't go around testing everybody for everything So I don't know And I I think it could be used to hassle somebody If someone was out to get you I think that a company or a boss could use this You know they could keep on doing this to you or something I guess I can see where it could become a problem Really Oh wow But two utts maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago sv That's the other thing I mean a lot of a lot of people as kids or you know young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever Yeah I think that's true Yeah yeah So that probably wouldn't be too good either
