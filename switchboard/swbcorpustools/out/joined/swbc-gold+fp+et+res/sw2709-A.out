Right Actually my son once said that that perhaps uh what we should do is is buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest And and that might be the solution Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh No I don't I don't know I lived in the Middle East for sometime and I I do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because uh I know a lot of people that were in a sense not qualified is the wrong word but certainly were deserving to come And it seemed to take them a long time or or there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come And so I would guess that you know there are quotas for different places You know I I I think there's something about being able to to claim um imminent danger or I'm not sure what the terminology is Maybe political a- Yeah There there you go You got the term And maybe that's a an issue with a a lot of people I don't know But Yeah I I guess I haven't been in a situation where it's it's been threatening to to me Uh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh I was going to say I'm not s- I I would guess that it's not that they are any brighter but they just maybe work harder or Right right May- but maybe part of that's the problem that here we've we've let this value slip And they need to have some competition Uh-huh Well that's too bad Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Oh that's really sad Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well and it sounds like you feel that there is need for change Maybe the <> uh you know the e- there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to to allow for adequate melting into the society Right Exactly Oh Uh-huh Um Right Right right Right Uh-huh uh-huh Right I would I would suspect that they have Well I guess um I don't have much much more to contribute to the topic Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Goal directed Goal directed Oh I see Uh-huh Sure sure Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Yes Up in the Gaithersburg area Uh-huh Well no I think I think there as I recall in my son's class there were were an awfu- an awful lot of mi- minorities And uh of all of all varieties And <> with the same you know some of the some of the same problems that you've mentioned But uh I don't know I guess I wasn't involved enough to to uh really stop to think about it Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Exactly exactly Right right Well it was good talking to you And I h- Okay And have a good weekend A- all righty Bye-bye
