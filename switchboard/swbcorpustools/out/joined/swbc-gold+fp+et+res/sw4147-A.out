Do you have any Uh-huh All right Yeah Oh that's good You don't often find that I don't think Right Uh-huh Sure There's a okay uh that's interesting Yeah the only pet that I've had uh I'm a I'm a doctoral student right now and in my in my earlier days as a student I kind of time shared on a dog with a a good friend of mine and uh it was an amazing dog it really was They had he had gotten it from the pound and uh it it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino Kind of looks like a dom- a Dalmatian and we trained it from a pup and basically it right now it it's fully trained and it can do a lot of things It will get beer for you out of the fridge and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff So it's really it's it's kind of a show piece any- more and whenever anybody comes over we all have to show him Domino you know Yeah it's uh she's been a real good a real good dog and uh just it's kind of a shame that I'm I'm go- I'm away from it now I I j- I actually live in Florida but I'm on an internship up here for a year and then I go back down but uh yeah Domino's a real good dog Uh what uh possessed you to get the dog Yeah Uh-huh Sure Sure learn a bit learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that That's good That kind of builds some character a little bit Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that's something that's important for sure I think uh do you live in a in a in a fairly rural part of the uh or Oh I see Um Yeah it's not that big of a problem With Domino she was full grown I would estimate seventy pounds And you know we lived in Oviedo which is a small town it's a suburb of Orlando but there's not there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around and she was a dog that loved to run so that was the biggest problem I saw and I think that's one of the uh the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is you know do you have the room for this dog to run around or s- you know I guess you can't really say for cats Me and cats don't get along too well uh but you know that whole space issue I think is real important Right Yeah that that Sure and that's all part of y- of keeping your part of the relationship You know showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those uh those issues You know and also the whole whole thing with noise My mother oh she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs that don't train them and you know we h- we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had uh Brittany Spaniels and they're very high strung animals to begin with but uh
