Yes um how do you feel about um the way the U S has reacted in the Middle East Huh-uh What is the Woodward book you are referring to Huh-uh Huh-uh Right That was my feeling I was I was very against our involvement so quickly Huh-uh Huh-uh Right I think we're very naive as far as that part of the world is concerned Right Right In spite of all the promises Huh-uh Huh-uh Huh-uh Huh-uh Huh-uh Huh-uh And I'm not sure we're sensitive to to other cultures Huh-uh Huh-uh But I'm not sure it's something you can teach I mean awareness Huh-uh That's true That's true Yeah Right Right And um what about the whole situation with the refugees the Kurds But what about the Palestinians Right Right Huh-uh Huh-uh Huh-uh Huh-uh Well do you think the U S should even be involved I mean as the world leader in the sense trying to resolve these issues or should we have just stayed out of it Right Right Right Huh-uh Right But in a sense I don't know that I would say it's good in a sense I'm glad that Saudi wasn't more changed by by the situation because I mean we really don't I mean I don't think it's our world to westernize the whole world so the fact that the Saudi could just sort of pull back and uh remain you know culturally sort of clean is interesting Huh-uh Right Right Well you know I mean I actually lived in Beirut from sixty-eight to eighty-four <> And so I mean it's been dangerous for sometime I'm not sure that it's changed that much Well see that's it It really hasn't Exactly it depends on whether one talks physical or or sort of cultural Culturally I mean it's obviously changed a lot Because it's more of a survival city but the buildings are still intact and still beautiful you know you know There was garbage on the corner when I got there and there's garbage when I left But I mean it's just a different cultural aspect I mean the trucks don't come daily and you really don't want the garbage in your house so And I mean I traveled in the area too And um so that many of the countries Turkey and Syria are the same as they were for traveling Yeah I was never able to go to Baghdad It was I never could get a visa So even before so even when things were good in the Middle East Americans weren't really given visas to go into Baghdad And um but it's it's a very beautiful part very interesting historically of course which was my interest art history So uh Right Right Huh-uh Huh-uh I see I see Then great and um you know have a good business trip Okay thank you Bye-bye
