Uh not too bad really Uh I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just I really didn't want it but I got it anyway and uh it was a Braun and they were real good about taking it back It wasn't a problem at all so uh I was able to get that back pretty easily But uh I don't know I really haven't returned a whole lot lately Have you Um Right Yeah Right like Exactly I was reading Right I was reading something in uh CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact They were talking about cars uh the car issue just came out And about how yeah you'd like to buy an American car maybe but uh you know the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever Uh like I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger and and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi You know so it's like what are you going to do you know But uh that's the way it is I don't know I I personally feel that uh uh if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them you know that's the way it goes and you know people man- more than manufacturers should get a clue and you know they should start making quality products That's what I thought too until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue Uh they've got all the American well all the all the cars rated you know and uh essentially I h- I don't see much of a trend I mean just like every other time that you look at it the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there There's nothing wrong with them Uh and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy and they're pieces of junk Yeah that's ninety that's eighty-six through ninety-one But uh I don't know may- maybe they're getting better maybe they're starting to get a clue Uh Yeah that's just it Technology that comes in right now is is probably not going to be imple- implemented until you know quite a few years down the road But uh Oh yeah Yeah because technology is so uh you know volatile and changing all the time Uh Yeah Yeah It uh th- they keep up c- with it pretty quickly and that's that's a real good thing I guess Uh I don't know Yeah Right they're kind of the leaders right now you know I used to see all those commercials for Windows you know and you're like oh gee they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name Yeah you know Exactly almost is the key word there too you know because I I really I've used both and I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all Uh Yeah yeah that's true too But uh I don't know I'm really I've gotten a little bit out of the the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home I I do use a Mac at work but uh uh I really don't don't do much with it at home but uh Right Uh-huh Yeah you sound like you must uh work in the computer business Yeah All right No Well that's that's all right Yeah that's true Something that I find uncomfortable is you know you you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know let let's take the example the modem for you know Okay w- w- what baud rate do you get Well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba-
