Well I have a uh pretty wide taste uh in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to uh lot of different forms of uh music In fact it's easier for me to say uh the types of music that I don't like are opera and uh screaming heavy metal Uh-huh Oh I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to but uh the the uh basic point of heavy metal w- which seems to be music to annoy you is uh gets a little annoying Uh lot of stuff that actually has uh ended up becoming popular like uh Nirvana and uh oh you know I'm thirty so lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and and the Sex Pistols and R E M that sort of stuff Uh R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being uh you know ultra mainstream at this point and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed Uh-huh Uh-huh I think it is Uh for a while there music seemed to really ha- popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it I was really tired of uh the Michael Bolton Mi- Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes And I could uh go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money I guess That and a marvelous hairdo Uh-huh Well i- it's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music and I like a lot of classical music but I also dislike uh some classical music and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music and feel that if if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time Uh Stuff that I like uh I like Bach I tolerate Vivaldi I can't stand uh uh Debussy or Debussy <> Uh uh I like Tchaikovsky He can make a lot of noise when he's uh so inclined Uh and some of some stuff that I like uh for instance Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition and that's interesting music but it would not get performed by any uh municipally funded uh philharmonic uh just because number one it's Frank Zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive You know we're we're much better off playing uh Beethoven's ninth that's right you know w- we'll do we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and and hum it and i- it it just isn't chance taking enough for me Uh I feel that uh that that music should take chances in one way or another and that uh you know if you've heard a piece oh a hundred a hundred times
