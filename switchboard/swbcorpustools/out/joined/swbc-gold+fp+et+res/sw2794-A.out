So how do we fix the national budget Well That would probably be good but something that the government hasn't been looking at is the source of the problem The true source of the problem is a that we do spend too much but also b that we don't take in enough Uh too few Americans are working If more Americans were working and meaningful good paying labor and paying taxes and the tax structure was fair between the lowest and the highest income Americans then we would have more money there to play with Right Well I hesitate to say we ought to spend ourselves to affluence but in fact in some cases that's what we ought to do Not Reaganomics thank you Uh what I was thinking more along the lines of is start going to space Well at some point there there will be enough jobs for most of the ab- able-bodied Americans We also need to uh assure that there's some work in the private sector I think it would do something for it I think we would fill up new technologies But I think we should also do something rather radical Legalize marijuana What Yes uh okay I think it would take some of that money out of the hands of criminals I think it would put reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another I think that I think most importantly it would give the federal government something new that they could tax And probably a lot of and really receive some revenues from Uh if you look at prohibition historically it's repeal helped the federal government a lot in tax revenues Then I think once we put money back into the cof- in the coffers of the federal government and get the federal government to where there's money there again we should reduce the amount of money and this would have to come rather quickly and would have to come originally also where we're not paying in some cases we do pay more for welfare recipients to live then they can earn in the true minimum wage environment And you can't deny people the right to supply their families better through whatever means That's just sensible on their part It's just sensible on their parts to go after the the the greater amount of income So if you lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage then more people will get off welfare You know give them a true incentive to want to work And then don't start letting more outsiders in for a few years until we figure out exactly where we're at with unemployment Reduce immigration or eliminate it entirely for a few years until we get our own house in order Oh absolutely absolutely That's right when we're in a world of hurt well I don't I'm not going to say that we ought to re- reduce them through legal means I think we ought to just tax them severely It seems only fair And I think really if we got all those that are able-bodied into the work force <> reduced <> the amount going out for those purposes created new jobs for that work force there would be plenty of money And then at that point quit spending on space Force it all into the into the private sector That's right Uh space was just a convenient place for me to go because that would put a lot of a lot of Millspec and NASA work operates to the same demanding specifications that would put a bunch of defense workers back to work You know what causes that Uh no Your your buying large uh the government specifications sheets of paper for building a pair of B V D underwear for the federal government is twenty-two foot tall If it was all on nine by elevens stacked one on top of another For making government issue underwear To just understand those legal requirements and operate within the government guidelines costs the company a huge amount of money Yes a huge amount of it is not the fault of the contractor Uh a huge amount of what you hear on about the seventy-five dollar hammers and the nine hundred dollar toilet seats doesn't come from people in the industry it comes from senators that don't know anything about it Uh my job is government tooling specialist Yeah
