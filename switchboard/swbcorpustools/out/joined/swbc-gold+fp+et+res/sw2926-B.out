Uh-huh What do you think about what do you think about the the lower grades you know K through seven Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yep I uh Uh-huh Yeah I I I just read some things recently where um uh colleges now uh graduate programs in general now train basically they're fifty per cent foreign Uh Yeah oh just about f- yeah but when you consider um when you consider uh especially in technical areas science engineering and computers Yeah especially in those areas it's um I kn- it's it's almost fifty per cent foreign like forty-eight per cent and that involves both Canadian and uh uh European Middle Eastern and and Far Eastern yeah I I think um I think I have similar views that's you know where our elementary grades um i- it's amazing I have a friend who's an e- who's an elementary school teacher and she said that they recently you know they have to go through they have to they have to pat the kids down because they bring guns to school She teaches in the city of Baltimore and that Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right Yeah a- and it's uh uh it's really you know kids can't read um it's really they you know by the time they my wife teaches uh middle school Yeah an- and they can't yeah by the time they get there they can't read The- they they can't read anything Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I think it's it's probably the work that your your children your children are doing uh um She she's yeah she can tell she can tell you know when they have kids come in for they meet with all of the parents and she can tell before a parent comes in normally you know give or take eighty ninety per cent you know what the parents are going to be like when they come in and the responses the parents will give back Oh yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right I think I think it's probably very true Uh-huh Uh-huh But you know surprisingly I I because you put such a commitment on education um your children probably could have gone to schools with uh uh a higher student teacher ratio and still done well because when they would come home you and your wife would say you know what did you do today if we let's sit down and read together Yeah Uh-huh Yeah oh it's parental Yep Uh-huh yeah But you kn- you know what's really funny is that they there's been some research because I'm a I'm a college professor and um uh and and w- a lot of the research shows that like Georgetown while Hewing was playing at Georgetown basketball Georgetown and they were winning endowment to the university in other words money that could to everything everything and normally gets directed away from sports realistically a lot of the was uh was probably two-thirds I guess it's now two-thirds of what it was when they were national champions In other words while they're national champions people donate more money Average human beings like you and I average Joes that make a decent salary that are a graduate of the school send big bucks like couple hundreds of dollars but thousands of people Because no bec- normally it's because of the sports Right right but see the sports brings in the money Because when Georgetown was number one their their their money that was donated to them from companies from from l- from business people from graduates whatever was up into you know like twenty million dollars and now it's down to like fourteen million During that time period in other words their income has slow- their their al- alumni giving and other funds have slowly dropped since then Uh-huh Yeah Yeah That's yeah It's it's amazing the way but now that's big time Yeah But but uh smaller schools aren't like that uh only only the big time schools show that But you're right I I think the emphasis on sports and as a see I'm a I'm a I'm a former athlete in a sense I swam um but swimming never gets much glory so it really doesn't matter But That's true that's true but you know they still He didn't make it no I I would have liked it if he if he would have though but I think uh realistically you know you read the the research studies and uh I don't think he would have made it simply because the w- the event he was trying to swim they even the research shows that distance running so I would assume distance swimming might be similar that and he was good at distance Spitz as a swimmer you know at I can remember that but the distance um the the distance strength and endurance or whatever sort of starts to peak at about twenty-eight twenty-nine thirty That's why some of your long distance runners were in their l- early thirties and but he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event and most of them are under twenty-five Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh Oh you're kidding Jeez Huh And that as as an athlete I just hate that Go head yeah what were say- what were you saying Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah I think I think I think uh in in some sense um what I would do before I would extend a school year is I would make it better Before I would continue the agony and something you have to consider too um because I know a- as a as a as a former high school teacher I know that from right now
