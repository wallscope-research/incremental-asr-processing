Well I I don't think that it's it's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions For instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's where there's uh endangerment to their own life and other people's lives Uh-huh Yeah Well how do you how do you feel about uh companies drug testing prior to hiring Uh-huh Uh-huh Well what about random testing though Do you feel like that's an in- invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested I don't know that you do If it's random then it's random and that's not necessarily fair Uh-huh Yeah Well I ha- I know that for instance in the N C double A they drug test and it's not random Uh well I think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season and from that point on uh at the N C double A does have something to do with it but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each in- individu- individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem And and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time Well not being a drug user I don't have a problem with that personally but I think that might be a violation of someone's rights If someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to h- behave differently and their manager assumes they have a drug problem I mean if someone assumed that of me I would be upset It's an accusation and and it's and it's based on on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave uh normal uh you know Right exactly I I don't + the I think  almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from from the janitors to the executive management What type of job do you have Uh-huh Well does your r- does your job require you to drive company equipment or to ap- operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone Well that doesn't I mean I Uh-huh That is odd I was drug tested uh not for the job I have now but for the prior job uh but I know that they sent that the job I had before that well the job I have have now requested my uh uh my uh medical record from my old company so I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion Well no I don't think they can they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I I didn't I mean they don't know that I don't use drugs They just tested me once But I used to work for a power company so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen uh were clean And since I was just you know one of the office folk I guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly But I know they test most of the service people fairly regularly reg- uh just across the board No they're all of them are tested once every three mo- it's a rotation But it but again it depends on what job you're in The men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot and the men that drive the trucks with with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much But but see they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what what the drug testing schedule is They say we we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here Yeah it's it's made very clear upon hiring Well have we spent our at least five minutes Okay Okay Nice talking to you Bye-bye
