So so what have you seen lately that um you think is worthwhile No I I saw the previews Does does he does it have a happy ending or Uh-huh Oh that was funny wasn't it Yes and and and and the regular NAKED GUN and AIRPORT and you know Yes Right So now these are for two very different movies One one uh absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly you know serious subject Yeah I I guess I have similarly broad tastes Um my most recent um movie that I that I liked a lot not my most recent movie was HENRY THE FIFTH I only rented it you know maybe a month ago and it's been out for a couple of years but Have you seen that Well it's it's a it's an adaptation of the of the Shakespeare play and it's beautifully done Um I believe that all the language is as Shakespeare wrote it except it's been shortened a little bit and there might be a word or two changed Uh but it's it's it's a glorious movie um and I like as you know these these these sil- silly movies and I also like just some strange movies Do you have any Well the the one that comes immediately to mind I um is the THE COOK THE THIEF HIS WIFE HER LOVER Um but there are also these various um David Lynch movies Um I got I got hooked on TWIN PEAKS That made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie I could lay my hands on Oh Um well I don't I don't especially recommend I mean you have you have to just sort of like this thing you have to like did you see TWIN PEAKS No so okay So if you weren't if you weren't drawn to watch that you maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies either They're they're just strange Well uh I think suspense is the right word Uh and but but a little bit strange and esoteric and uh in the case of TWIN PEAK a little there's some elements of the supernatural in it too That was the television show Um there's also a a a producer of movies in Baltimore called um John Walters who who puts puts on even weirder movies Uh his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream like HAIR SPRAY Um but back in his early days he he he had things um um what what are the titles I can't remember the titles any more But some really weird ones uh with quite a random crew of of characters Um it would have made you know these Fellini movies look normal I do I do like movies a lot Do do you rent them or Yes Yeah that's what my wife does too um I mean she falls asleep So we have to we have to pick just the right kind of movie to to to to appeal Well well it was good talking to you Take care Okay bye
