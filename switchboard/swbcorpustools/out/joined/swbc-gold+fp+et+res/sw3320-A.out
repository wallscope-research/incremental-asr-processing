We're supposed to talk about crime in the city And uh seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays doesn't it Well it is but our crimes up here uh as I think it must be in most cities now but uh I was listening to the news the other day and they said they thought a lot of it the reason it was up so was because of the uh so many people are without work nowadays economy's so bad That's a good point That's just what they quoted over the news I don't know if I believe that or not but it it does seem up and What kind Well we got a I think we got a pretty good newspaper Uh we have two the MORNING NEWS and the uh TIMES HERALD MORNING NEWS seems to have the largest circulation I think it's a pretty good it's a locally owned paper The HERALD is owned I think by the TIMES out of uh L A or somewhere But Well they don't no not really uh they don't play it up I don't think Uh but there there is too much of it you know uh too many homes broken into We had our our fact about uh last year sometime our home was broken into We Yeah we uh uh I didn't think ours ever would be burgled into burgled but so many in our neighborhood had been and uh because we live on a corner and back up to a real uh highly traveled main street But uh we were so uh Sort of yeah And I never did get a security system but since that happened I certainly have It's uh uh I guess excuse me just a standard Uh with the uh all the doors and the uh infrared thing you know motion detector Pre- Pretty standard Yes yes It's monitored and all that And I think uh the thing that makes a lot of noise would would suffice I really do But uh this deal that was part of it for you know three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever And uh but it uh the monitoring is not that bad though because uh uh we've goofed it up you know several times you'll hit the wrong key not intentionally or something and and they call back pretty quickly so I guess it's you know I think it's all right But I to answer your question I think uh uh I think uh that is a pretty good deterrent in itself whether it Uh-huh Well it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly Tha- uh that if it's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway Supposedly Who knows you know But that's a selling point And I think they're probably I think it probably does these things or sur- supposedly pretty good Boy they sure advertise them you know so many of them nowadays But uh well don't don't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there I'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's Down here we seem to or or not here but the statistics seem to say that I don't know Is that right I would gather probably from drugs And I think that's the reason it's so high everywhere But I don't think there's anyplace used to years ago you thought well these little small cities and all wouldn't have that problem but they do We've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it uh as anyone you know That's a good question I don't know I don't know what the solution is I really don't Yeah Yep Th- and nothing seems to change And uh I'm not sure that anything will because these if something could happen to make these people not want to buy it uh but they want to buy it so Supply and demand Long as somebody wants to buy it somebody going to provide it for them So I don't know I don't got you know I don't know what the solution is I really don't I don't think anyone does in fact
