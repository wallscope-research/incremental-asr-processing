I'm in Rome New York Rome New York yeah Yeah I I New York does not but uh they're they're trying to reinstate it and the governor's opposed to it being that uh the Democrat that he is and Mario Cuomo but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it I'd I would agree with that almo- even more I don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically but I'm really offended by the thought that I have to support uh just the existence of you know murder rapist whatev- + wh- you know right that + uh after they've gone and done horrible things molested children and kill them whatever that society has to pay uh upwards uh thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them Right I I don't know it's a hard question you look at the United States we have the largest murder rate of any developed uh or uh Here in New York it's a lot harder than that uh it takes uh it takes almost six months to get uh handgun permit in this state Now the the and that's with uh you have to have uh oh a police investigation you have to have references and I know because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference uh and I know it there is it's very easy to get uh uh you know there's no restrictions whatsoever on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that which aren't the I I don't consider to be the kind of cri- crime uh weapon you know uh so Right Right Yeah yeah well a- and the thing with Bundy was though he escaped and then yeah and did it again and uh No Uh-huh Oh God Great Surely there's and end to the situation Right Uh-huh Right Rome New York it's up state it it's uh near Syracuse it's about uh well I I actually live in a Village of Sylvan Beach I work in Rome uh It's more rural uh it use to be use to be a uh uh have a lot of heavy industry but it's kind of uh all the industry has gone south and uh now the Air Force is the largest employer in the uh area and uh uh so it's Not too bad it you know you still have the uh more drug problems and typical uh small city type problems but I don't know that there's a real uh no there isn't the harsh crime and all Uh-huh Uh-huh Right I think I think Penn- Pennsylvania may have just reenacted it because I'm from uh from Pennsylvania also just uh just outside of Philadelphia Yeah Right The west part of the state is and then the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases so Right Right Sure Yeah if your friends or family got uh had that happen to them I think everyone would I they'd probably pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face as they did it Yeah Right Right Right Well uh  I + uh yeah I  don't know I think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless because I guess it's a pretty pretty rough thing to be uh electrocuted Oh yeah an injection yeah that would be even yeah I didn't even think about that I think yeah there's more that don't have it but amazingly it's like uh Massachusetts went back and reinstated capital punishment oh maybe six or seven years ago I don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it but uh it's on the books Right
