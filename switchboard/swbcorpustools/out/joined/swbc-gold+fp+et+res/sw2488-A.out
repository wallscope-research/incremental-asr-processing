Okay Deanna uh on capital punishment in our state they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman and I believe also in shooting of uh rape I mean killing a rape victim I mean someone in the process of rape and I don't know what el- I don't really remember what else But I think it's justified Very much so I think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman I mean I think they're doing their duty but I think if they're going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it That's right I agree Right uh-huh Oh I think Right right did you see SIXTY MINUTES tonight by any chance Well they were showing a segment on a man in Philadelphia that's going after the drug dealers He's just a civilian he's a black man and he just got fed up with it And he said he's had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything trying to ge- keep him quiet but he's organizing people and they're going out and marching on the corners and takin- taking back their territory I think so I think That's right I think you're right Right We won't allow this in our neighborhood And it said they're going to other neighborhoods from there and then quite often they'll get shot because they're horning in on somebody else's territory I think they said forty-one had been shot out of one church in the last year Right I know it Well it goes all through the st- it goes all through the state supreme court system before they're Uh-huh then it should happen yeah That's right Right Uh-huh that's right Yeah it is I know but that that's the way it is We had one in Virginia that was sentenced to death and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago I don't know if there was anything in your paper about it And there was a lot of protest even Robert Redford you know was protesting this guy's execution So the governor backed down and I was so mad The crime was horrible his crime was just horrible No I don't think Huh-uh Huh-uh and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me Right yeah That's right yeah yeah I do too Right Wasn't it Lewisburg that had a lot of uh bad things happening just in the last couple of weeks or was it not No Mayb- it was I think it was the south east area from Dallas My daughter my daughter lives down in Rowlett and she was telling me about it Yeah Uh I can't remember what the town was some little area Oh gosh And that's the last they se- Yeah Oh gee Is that right I hadn't heard about that Gosh They don't kill them They just mo- Gosh Gosh Boy that's scary isn't it Yeah Oh boy Yeah you wouldn't even dare put these signs in the win- little emblems in the window saying child in this room in case of fire you know Have you seen those Yeah Yeah Yeah it is Uh-huh Oh gosh oh gosh Yeah Uh-huh yeah Oh Oh boy And he's five Shoo I guess so Gee I know Yeah there was a little girl picked up in Rowlett from uh from her front yard and her dad was working in the back yard and had just left her few minutes in the front yard and somebody apparently drove up and took her and they never saw her again Yeah Right uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right yeah And watch yeah yeah I don't blame you Uh-huh And if they find who's doing that to those little girls as far as I'm concerned he could fry Yeah Right Yeah Yeah Huh-uh that's terrible Oh gosh It's going to be reduced right uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah It's just not it just doesn't seem right Well what are we going to do about it How I mean how can it be changed Unless the legislature will do something and they don't seem to Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Right Right I think so Yeah I think it would be worth it everybody wo-
