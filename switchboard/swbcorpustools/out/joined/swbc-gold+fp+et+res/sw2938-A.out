All right Do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there The uh Oh you mean for like smog and stuff Huh Uh-huh Huh What do you think of that uh the greenhouse effect that's going on Yeah that's causing the hole in the ozone Uh-huh It it is scary though isn't it Right Well all right North Carolina That's up there by Kentucky isn't it Uh-huh Okay Okay Well Kentucky's next to Virginia I'm pretty sure Well I'm from Kentucky I should know but I don't I'm sorry But Kentucky we use to have severe I mean just real cold cold winters and we'd have three and four feet of snow Course here in Texas they don't have snow they don't know what snow is They freak out when there's snow on the ground Oh Amarillo Well that's close to here How long have you been in Raleigh Well how old are you Okay Well we're the same age Yeah I forget my age all the time so that's okay It's I think it's just something that goes with the territory But to me Texas see and Kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school Okay In Texas I'm serious if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain I I swear they close everything down I just laugh I mean I do they get I mean and traffic slows down to nothing Oh well no northe- I'm from the north that's why I said we in Kentucky we I don't know you just get used to the weather and of course the people down in south they don- they're not used to cold weather and stuff and uh it just I don't know I just laugh every time they have a every time they have snow on the ground everything's closed up And you know you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road But uh No not really I mean not to see it Now of course there's you know T I is here Oscar Mayer and there is a few factories but I don't see much pollution going on Uh-huh Well see they have that um what is it a test or something like that they call it And uh that's supposed to cut down on it Yeah school buses and the commercial buses yeah Well they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is And uh it it gets bad Uh-huh Well that's a good idea Well uh the you know pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes When I was pregnant with my first little boy I had read it because back then because I was walking back and forth toc- well not back and forth I was walking home from uh the college I was going to in Kentucky And I was having to walk along the highway It was just one day a week But it was in I I have no sense of smell so I couldn't smell this but it would make me sick and I'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway But yeah it's yeah all the exhaust Uh well that was four years ago too it's probably a lot worse now Yeah Uh-huh Do you uh smoke W- yeah it's kind of l- Yeah because you do smoke one a day Um Uh For the air pollution Huh But they I don't hear much about it down here Course Texas we don't have a bunch of c- pollution But too we've got that air coming in off the coast And you know it'd blow it up north So maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here But no it would seem like it would be the same way in on the California coastline wouldn't it Uh-huh Uh-huh But they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially I think they do that for most everybody I- especially it's usually for the young children and the older the old people older old people It is Oh Oh well this is pretty wooded area down here so l- in a lot of parts yeah I know Texas is supposed to be flat but they've got you know down by the Denison Dam there's a lot of uh They do They live close then In Durant Oklahoma You go where Uh you go to visit them Oh Yeah well down by Lake Texoma there's a bunch of wooded area This but but Kentucky's beautiful They've got trees and trees are supposed to you know purify You know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff It's a philodendron It's supposed to filter the air for you in your home I had one My husband bought it for me when my daughter was born three months four months ago Yeah I do Yeah I do Yeah I did I couldn't make myself quit I did cut down a lot I got I I've got one vice and smoke is smoking is it I don't I don't drink and I try not to cuss and I do I do very little and smoking I just I got in the habit of it when I was about thirteen Yeah we're down here at the Bible belt aren't we Uh I wasn't saved until I got down here and people down here are just there's so many Christians and it's so different from Kentucky but Um I worked at T I for a while but then my brother-in-law works there and he got me into it How'd you get into it Well it's fun I like talking to new people And I half the time well a couple of times I've been interrupted by my little girl I've had to hang up and stuff But I enjoy it I talked to people from well C- what Carolina now up in uh Boston and New York well Boston is New York isn't it No Boston Massachusetts But I've talked to people in New York but I've talked to a lot of people in Texas because I guess it's because T Is down here With Boston I love their accent I do I love the Boston acc- accent I met a girl from Boston one time My husband was in the service so we went from Kentucky to Louisiana down here to Texas and his family's down here We're out of the service now Yeah he got out of it his unit right after Panama We went to Pana- he went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that And uh he
