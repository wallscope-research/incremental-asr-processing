Uh yes yes I have a daughter Yeah She's only about uh uh a little less than two years old No Yeah Uh no uh um no particular school Uh I think that's really a decision th- that They well help them make in terms of you know what they are they are wanting to do You know that that's a big influence I think and You know what not only what you can afford but what what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are So uh you know you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do Uh University of Mississippi Uh well it was well it was within the state But it it was not necessarily local it was What's the criterion for choosing to go there Uh well at the time I was uh thinking of going pre med and in the state uh they had the best pre med uh curriculum for the uh state institutions It was choice between there and uh a private college that uh was a bit more expensive At the time we really could not afford it so I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me It uh I enjoyed it No No no it was a six hour drive I was uh it was like another world Basically it was a no it was a did not get home that often you know and at that age it's uh it's kind of kind of difficult sometimes Especially if you have not been away a lot that extended Yeah Uh-huh Uh that's true Yeah that that's like you know when I went on to get my my masters I uh basically was you know it was where I was at the time You know I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled and I was trying to work But uh so when you are first going to school that you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go Um uh the computer science center Uh north building Uh about three years Uh yeah I have uh uh no actually I mean I came straight from school to here So cause this was the first first real job after getting my degree After my masters My undergraduate degree was not in not in what my masters was So I made a career change basically Yeah One day I would like to uh you know the uh I I like the school where I went I mean and I would not hesitate at all to to encourage her to go there there if she wanted to Or the school where I got my masters at which which was a different school And uh I liked it almost as well Uh but uh you know that I'm not going to hold them to that just because I went there I you know think that's If they want to that's fine but otherwise not Although I ca- uh would get quite a break on on tuition Yeah because they uh allow for uh uh tuition uh break for out of state students who children of alumnae Well certain schools do it This school does So uh It's it I I was involved in some uh oh alumnae recruiting uh here in town uh recently uh well last year Uh and it was kind of fun because you are trying to to trying to get people interested in your school you know And they were this was a college night at a at a high school in Richardson And it was And there were a bunch of kids you know and a bunch of schools There were a hundred schools probably there all competing for the same kids It's kind of interesting to to to talk up you know your school And I was surprised by the number of kids that came came by and had heard of you know our school And and were interested in it Uh you know we uh situations like that you don't realize you know until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others And so I I was real real pleased with that That worked out so well I think so I don't know offhand but uh it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there So there There was one mother who uh came by right even before we started who who obviously was uh very interested in getting her her daughter in or or having gotten her daughter in or something and she was wanting some more information But she was her her daughter was uh a a ma- ma- dru- a majorette or something You know a baton twirler or something and she was she was letting us know she how how good her daughter was She had cards printed up actually describing you know business cards describing her daughter's uh you know she had won several different twirling awards and all this and she was had these business cards she was passing out and it was quite a production I think some parents go a little bit overboard Yes
