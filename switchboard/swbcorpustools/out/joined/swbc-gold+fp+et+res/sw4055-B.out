Yes Uh yes I'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts And I camp uh every month uh camp at least one weekend and during the summer we camp uh two or three weeks a year I'd say I camp quite a bit Well uh we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping and we uh we also uh carry all our equipment with us and so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the um sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again How about yourself Well that's good Uh-huh Great What uh what kind of camping do they like best Do they like it where they have tents and uh do they cook on stoves Uh-huh Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah It doesn't get very cold in Texas so lots of times we don't even take tents We just use trail tarps Uh it's just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent uh like a uh they're very light weight and we use them when we go backpacking So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then uh they're not very heavy see so you carry them with you and they'll keep you dry or whatever Uh-huh Ye- yes in fact uh um last month we went camping we saw a lot of deer uh in the morning and the afternoon just deer everywhere Uh-huh so uh but it even though uh it wasn't hunting season and we were with Boy Scouts so of course we don't uh want to go hunting But we got to see a lot of deer um out and about and there's of course we see smaller animals all the time and uh one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night uh is uh make sure that all the food's put away and so forth because uh we have uh armadillos Do you know what armadillo is Uh-huh And possums and uh raccoons And we have those creatures down here that they like to uh they like to go hunting for a midnight snack And so that that uh that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away They will if you attack them But most time they run away from you if they if they see you're up you know but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep So
