Uh well I I guess it's a subject I haven't thought too much about Uh I don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools uh as much as we're expecting too much out of them Minnesota Wisconsin Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well it's it is getting very expensive to run schools so They've got computers now that you got to train on There's just so much uh more and less money to do it with Right Yeah Yeah yeah I I I guess that in uh talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools I I think they're expecting schools to discipline the kids and uh I think it should go right back to the parents If you don't train your kids right then Right yeah Yeah yeah I I know when I uh was going to school it wasn't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving I mean they do that now and they could probably lose their job Yeah yeah Right right Yeah It seems that'd be a subject that I I don't have much to say on Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Right Right Yeah I don't know e- e- maybe they should sit back and and kind of uh decide on where the money's best spent I know in a lot of cases uh different districts like to have nice fancy schools And maybe they should be a little more uh uh concerned with paying the right people to teach and and be uh satisfied with maybe a little older school Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Well I I know uh where I came from We didn't have a very uh rich community and uh high school that I went to was very old and uh as far as I know it's still there They've e- expanded on it but they've never built a new one and it's probably fifty sixty years old or or better and I don't foresee them uh building a new one for a long time because they can't afford it
