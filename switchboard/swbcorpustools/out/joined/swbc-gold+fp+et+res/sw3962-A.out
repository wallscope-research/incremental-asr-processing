Well uh what is your favorite kind of music Oh same here Yeah Oh well I guess I like a wide range Uh everything from uh from Baroque through at least some modern music And my wife and I these days are especially into opera We've been sort of opera fans for a few years now Well we uh generally the places we've gone they sing in the original languages Like the Dallas opera here normally does I guess Well one thing that's helped us a lot is that uh you you know you can buy a lot of these operas now on video casse- uh video tape and so we have quite a collection of those and you watch them at home and they have subtitles so you you figure out what's going on after a while and then you can enjoy it in the uh theater But you know the uh Dallas opera now has uh super titles on on all their performances I think Well they they give an uh an English translation on a on a screen up above the stage Yeah In fact they even do that for operas sung sung in English because it is hard to understand the words sometimes Yeah well I really like Vivaldi Uh he's uh definitely one of the one of the top of that era Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh How how old are they So they're doing this in school or what Uh-huh Well you've got half a string quartet there Yeah Well since you seem to like uh Italian music have you ever uh gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era the uh period right before actually before Vivaldi I guess Uh-huh Oh yes uh-huh No I don't but I think I know what it is Isn't that a uh uh see can't you get records through that or something recordings Uh-huh Yes yeah I think uh Uh Uh yes right So they're actually commissioned performances Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I had go- heard good things about the uh Music Heritage Society but if I get involved in one of those things I end up spending all my money on on music I almost uh almost uh bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago Yeah my roommate signed me up He got a bonus record and I got a lot of bills So we have to watch that Uh do you play any instrument yourself
