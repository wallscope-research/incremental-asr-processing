Probably so Yeah it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility Uh-huh I think so too I'm in Texas and very few people carpool uh the people that I know don't want to because uh they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon you know they just feel they need their car Uh-huh Uh-huh That's right And people don't want to give it up but now I think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and <> and to change the car itself but uh you know I I don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent but yeah should this be two slash units/ Well my other line is ringing but we're going to ignore it I'm sorry for these beeps Oh close to five minutes I believe And you're in Minneapolis Well is the pollution really bad up there Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that's the way it has gotten here We have just had that law I think about a year maybe a year and a half here in Texas but uh I think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that and uh but if they are polluting the air they need do need to have them fixed and you know there's a big move especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the C F Cs that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use uh they can't use like I have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning syst- systems therefore the individual every time they have a service call if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever it is it costs them three times as much to get it fixed and uh if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many C F Cs into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems you know But Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Um Uh-huh It's probably happened to millions of people Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Inhaled so much of it uh-huh Yeah well of course in the uh I think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt
