Okay Well uh what do you think about taxes do you think we're paying too much Uh-huh Yeah Yeah How true Yeah Well gasoline especially in this part of the country we all use it all the time you know it's that's not what I would consider a luxury Yeah Well um I I think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it and how it's being managed and so forth I mean I I think there could be a better system and we would get more for our money It's totally out of our hands so we don't we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes and uh But not really Yeah Well I think too one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by Congress and uh that don't seem to have any validity at all I mean they're always far out and uh you know they're studying some obscure bug you know in some other part of the world or some such thing and our tax money pays for those things and I think that's wrong I That's right Yeah And I think here lately they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize we're the nation in trouble The war Uh-huh Yeah And I think that's a mistake Somewhere you know we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away We know what trouble they got into Yeah Well I I think another thing too that um I've had a little contacted with uh in regard to taxes let's say that uh you have something that the I R S disagrees with or you know says hey we're not going to allow that Well I think they're very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you you will not only payback that that you wrote off but you will at least double that amount and Yes And that's to me there's something wrong there you know Yeah I mean I can see paying the interest and some small penalty but they really stick it to you big time Uh-huh Absolutely Uh-huh Yeah That's a lot Well I haven't counted I I would have guessed eight even but you might be right I don't have any idea Yeah Wow Yeah Yeah Yeah Well I I have another thing that I thought about too for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is and you know we're not typically talking about big dollars but here you feel like you've you've done something good you've you've earned your interest and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it So the real amount of your savings on that is is not much You know it's kind of a vicious circle there And then at a took that away as far as being Yeah Huh-uh Well you can come over to my house and spend it I wish I had some to spend No No I just don't have any Yeah That's the way it goes Well I guess we probably talked just about long enough Yeah Yes Uh-huh Uh I don't know You too Okay Good-bye
