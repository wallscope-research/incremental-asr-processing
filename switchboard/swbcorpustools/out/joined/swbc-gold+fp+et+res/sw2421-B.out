Well um I guess I I'm more concerned about public safety than I am about the um the concern for the private uh the idea of preserving privacy for the individual um because I can't really see why anyone um who has nothing to hide would object That's of course that is certainly true yeah Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Sure If you had to have a drug test Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Checked out or whatever But it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that Um I agree that that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test but I would think that um that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that For example that one uh positive would not be uh accepted as an automatic um reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive uh dismissal or treatment or whatever but that that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps uh one or two more stages where further tests could be ta- uh done Because um there are there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with with uh false positives for certain kind of drugs On the other hand um I think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested because of the of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in uh industries well the transportation industry for spe- uh you know specifically But um in many many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs it's not even going to effect anybody but his uh you know himself and his own family perhaps um depending on the kind of drug he might be on But um and eventually that's going to show up anyway in the way he works and so on But there's so many things that it would make a difference I guess I I uh I would not want to have anyone in my family uh victimized by someone who you know a a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that who um you know hadn't been tested Yeah Yeah Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Make it difficult enough Yeah yeah Yeah according to what you you hear The people who um have serious problems I mean we have um really I guess we're kind of lucky We really only know of one uh young man who uh who's a fam- they go to our church and it's the son and so on and he was friends with my children um and he's really the only one that I know of personally who got himself really messed up um ha- having been involved with drugs But I know of a number of other people who have you know gotten all messed up Most of these are young people I work in the education system and so I have a little more contact with that But um the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking and he may never really be a productive member of society But sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are are almost uncontrollable I mean he he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that you know he he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not I mean he's you know he's so messed up And um this was a nice sweet young man who teenager you know and he's now a young man about twenty I guess who um just got really down the wrong path And uh you know I don't know that that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing But seeing what drugs did to him makes me see makes me realize what it could do to people you know in the work force as well Um it's horrible Well the limits uh uh would I think have to do with what I'd alluded to before that there needs to be a further um that that one positive on a drug test would not constitute uh dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might uh have set up for those who genuinely have a problem In other words there needs to be um more than Pard- yes right there needs to be more than one test and there needs to be some some measure of uh certainty before anything drastic happens There are lots of things that are involved there um such as perhaps insurance uh you know denial of insurance for someone um and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this um that would that you know it would be unfair and people who are on medication for example or um even people who might be of the gay community and I'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society but um I think that there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination because it makes a bigger problem Um so it seems to me that that um there needs to be some ground you know some rules that protect I'm not sure though when we talk about what rules if any that we should say well certain segments should not have to be tested I really don't see why And yeah Yeah I don't I don't know why it would be you know uh bad to test just every- and it may be you know it's not feasible to do everyone but certainly random testing the fact that people know that that they Yeah would be some measure of protection But the bottom line is that that if if you're going to stay clean and straight then um you're you're going to do that because you want to Really Yeah That's very true Well it sounds like we agree anyway Yeah I guess if that's all we've done and I guess we've talked long enough It was nice talking to you Okay bye-bye
