Okay Well I can go ahead and start and tell you mine and We're from San Antonio and that's where I grew up So I was used to the heat out here right now Gosh it gets to about seventies high seventies and it gets very cold at night And Monterey it's um right on the coast And I don't know if your familiar with California coastline your> you're but we're we're about two hours about a two hour drive south of San Francisco And it's uh really nice It's a big area for people to come from the different uh countries mostly like Japan Germany and England And they usually go to Carmel and vacation on the beaches so it's it's pretty nice uh year round But uh cool always cool in the evenings And warm warm in the Summer but it's stays pretty cold even uh during the Winter for as nice as it is And um we usually get a fog Uh right about I guess about four o'clock and it kind of rolls in over the coast And uh then it usually breaks back off again the next morning And if you go just a little bit ways in I'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards Salinas uh the weather completely changes and it gets very hot and dry and the fog never makes it that far But along here it's uh very very different from the Texas type weather What's it like down there Oh really well at least you've got some Uh-huh Oh well that's good Uh-huh Have y'all been having any heat waves or like the ninety degree Uh-huh Uh-huh Women that's good For this time of year Uh-huh Uh-huh So do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff this year Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh I miss that Oh Oh well that's real nice because I can remember two years ago that in about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just continued At least y'all are getting some rain up in Dallas I'm glad to hear that Uh-huh Y'all weren't getting any of the strings of the tornadoes and stuff were you Uh-huh Oh gosh Uh-huh Oh Yeah I really don't miss all the heat there I'm getting acclimated to have the cool evenings so we get a bit of a relief Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Oh Is that what Dallas is okay Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come It's it's a complete mess everything floods all the under passes I didn't realize that Dallas had that same problem Uh-huh Well we could use some rain up here We're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought up here and they had a pretty good early Spring and we got quite a bit of rain but it wasn't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years And uh so they're still talking water rationing this Summer so it would seem strange because in San Antonio we had lived out um west of San Antonio in Castroville And the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing and I thought oh gee I'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the California Pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers and there's no problem with water And then I came here and found out they were in the you know four year draught So I said well gee this is pretty much like Texas And it pretty much is in the middle of Summer They have rolling hills around here but um they turn to golden dead grass for the majority of the Summer just because there is no water to keep them green But um it's a really nice area It's just it's just such a change from uh Texas because I had grown up with uh the heat and used to essentially like you said you have the cold Winter and then you have the hot Summer Spring And uh to come here it's kind of the temperate weather all year round It's kind of like uh Spring I guess if you year round except and then in the Winter and then it seems sort of like a San Antonio early Winter or Fall year-round So it seems like we only have two Springs which is or two seasons and that would be Spring and Fall We never really get any of the other ones But it's a really nice uh change of pace Yeah To the heat I really don't miss the heat Um we do a lot of you know when you do a lot of outside like running and stuff it's just so much easier up here and you don't have to worry about the high humidity Does Dallas get high humidity Or is it pretty dry Uh-huh Yeah It seems like San Antonio is increasing in humidity over the years because I had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid more and more humid And here it's uh well it's right by the ocean but um it's not the same as Corpus Corpus you get that humid salty feeling in the air But here um well the water is extremely cold up here you can lay on the beach all you want but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit And a thick wet suit at that because it's just extremely cold and I for some reason because of the cold uh ocean uh water the air is always cool It's never humid or sticky or salty feeling so I really like that about this area And uh we just hadn't expected it we were used to what uh gulf coast weather was like when we came here to Pacific coast weather It's just completely different and it's much nicer Uh-huh It does and the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region But you um but we like it so it's a nice change So we'll be here a couple of years and we thought well we'll take advantage of it and see what all the Pacific coast is like So it's been good Oh I imagine Virginia I imagine gets real humid doesn't it Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Not like Texas where everything comes to a stand still Uh-huh I'll have to try that out because I had heard that North Carolina was sort of like that And uh I've just never really been in that region of the country and I guess I'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like Because a lot of people that are from that North Carolina region really like it And uh they get the snow but they said it doesn't really get messy and it doesn't really hang around that long So they the people I know that are from there uh they always miss it and they want to go back Nothing seems quite as good But anyway Well Oh gee-whiz Oh gosh Well I hope it moves up this way but I'm sure it won't Yeah Because we could sure use it Well you think that takes care of the time and Okay Well I sure appreciate hearing how things are going in Texas and uh Yeah Good luck to you Okay We'll see you Bye
