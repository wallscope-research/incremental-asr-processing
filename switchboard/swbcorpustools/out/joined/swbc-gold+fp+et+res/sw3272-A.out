Okay I don't do you have an opinion on that on the U S R Uh-huh Sure <> Uh-huh Sure Sure Sure that happens Uh-huh Sure I guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot go into a war Uh they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together but I could not foresee them severing what they have with the U S Um because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation Um from what I've been hearing is the U S uh S R has been uh almost bankrupt for years and it's people are desperate and there might be a revolution within the people But I don't think the U S would get involved with it because uh there's too close of ties to where I think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change and that we cannot run them like we run the U S and that they have to make their own independent decision So I guess I really have no fear at all of the U S S R verses uh you get these small little uh places like Iraq and all of that that might be something that I'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons verses uh a small uh or as big country of U S S R I I I have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them it would totally elat- you know it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time So I mean sure they have weapons to kill us over and over and over but to them that would be a suicide and they and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people But if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of you know doing whatever uh for their country they'll do it Uh Sure Sure Uh-huh sure I have a daughter that's frustrated She's on a a stool that she can get up on but i- if she can't get down on it it's like get me down right now But anyway it was really good talking to you and you have a good weekend Uh-huh Thank you Bye now
