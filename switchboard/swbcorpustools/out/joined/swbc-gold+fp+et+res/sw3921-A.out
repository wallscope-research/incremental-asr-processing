Okay Yes I love to fish Well it's mostly from the rivers and lakes And yes and from the banks I don't like to go out on boats Well it uh down here we usually catch catfish and bass stripped bass you know where I fish And trout up at uh Lake Shasta when I go up there But I like it all except uh really I don't I don't really care that much for the trout I think I had rather have a catfish than I would a trout Uh-huh See Well uh like in uh Iowa and Nebraska those little bullheads they look just like catfish huh You know that's what I mean cause I am from Iowa And uh you know we use to catch those little bullheads and that's they look just like baby catfish You know uh did you get to go fishing very often Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well uh you like to eat them after you catch them Because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing but they don't like to eat them You know Yeah I know If I go to a restaurant and order fish it's usually either salmon or uh red snapper You know We uh skin them Yeah Yeah yeah Just cut their heads off and skin them and then I just uh flour them salt and pepper them and cook them I don't put that corn meal on them You know uh that's the way my mother taught me to fry them so Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well you know I don't think I've ever tried cooking those uh catfish quite that big Uh most of them are just the small you know pan frying ones So uh Um Wouldn't that be something It's a thrill when you get a big fish though isn't it You know Uh-huh So when you were when you did go fishing where did you go You moved there from where Nebraska So it was just like the rivers and uh the lakes I suppose huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh
