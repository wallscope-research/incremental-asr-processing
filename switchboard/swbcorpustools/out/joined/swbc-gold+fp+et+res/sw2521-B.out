So who is your favorite football team Well I would say the Saints after since <> What's that Yeah Yeah Can't call them the New Orleans Ain'ts any more No Yeah Well I'm a I'm a Buffalo Bills fan from a from a long time ago So it's good to it's good to see the Bills doing so well now and Yeah What's that Uh Jim Kelly Uh-huh Yeah Well the it the the N F L draft really seems to be doing its job because got teams like like Buffalo who weren't certainly weren't a powerhouse uh ten years ago Now they've been able to get some good players and come around and th- New Orleans <> the same story and uh a few years ago Denver was a powerhouse and then they uh they weren't getting the draft picks and now the uh other team so it seems to be uh moving around and uh to to New Orleans' benefit and uh you see how look at the Cowboys now They're uh they're hurting slash error And uh Yeah W- Yeah W- w- well yeah Uh firing Tom Landry and hiring Jimmy Johnson what what kind of uh uh doesn't give you much respect for their team at all Any t- any team that tha- where the owner would fire Tom Landry you know is like one of the greatest coaches of all time And just because they had had a couple of bad seasons And you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching Right Right And he alway- and uh had a lot of trouble with injuries too You know he'd uh never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy And then even like uh what is it Eric Dickerson left the team you know tha- you're right You know like people were jumping ship right and left And I don't know that sounds to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem but then the team was sold So Yeah Right Well Yeah I know Who was the quarterback See I can't even think of who the New Orleans quarterback is Yeah Huh Did they were they able to draft anybody this year Uh-huh Right Well when is the N F L draft hasn't has the N F L draft even gone yet Right Right Well they've yeah they've Sure Right Or even making the playoffs so that doesn't doesn't help you in the draft Yeah Yeah Uh-huh That was a few years ago Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah Huh Right Oh that's one it's one thing Yeah Buffalo's lucky though to have uh Jim Kelly than now he's the number one rated quarterback in the N F L I think I'm pretty sure he was this past season And uh then with uh uh the defense with Bruce Smi- Bruce Smith there at linebacker there they've got a very well rounded team and it seems that they've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as they problems they had in the past and now they're uh really playing as a good together as a team So Uh when I can I'm a I'm a musician and uh the band I play in uh I this is just something on the side and uh the band I play in we tend to rehearse quite a bit on Sundays So I missed a lot of Sundays during this Ac- I I'd have to confess I don't really scope out the New Orleans games per se New Orleans just isn't isn't one of the areas I've lived in so many places I've lived in uh Denver but I don't like the Broncos There's no love for the Broncos But I've lived in uh uh I was born in Buffalo and I lived in uh outside of Boston for five years and then my family lives in Philadelphia now and uh so I tend to look for uh uh and I lived in Detroit too So I like uh first of all first and foremost the Bills games I want to see And then I'll uh normally check out the Eagles or the Patriots and Patriots were so depressing this last year that yeah that uh I kind of gave up on them But uh first and foremost the Bills I even wen- I went to got to go to a Bills game this year which was fun It was the the Bills Eagles game which appropriately enough fortunately the Bills won And it was good weather We beat Buffalo in in uh was it third of December And it was sunny and forty-five degrees So we couldn't a done much better than that in Buffalo Yeah Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh my gosh Sure and then they changed the game Right Right Right It was the network Right Yeah Yeah Well that's the that's the guy that counts Oh I I don't think Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills any time
