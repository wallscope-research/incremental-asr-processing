Uh why don't you go ahead first Sure Uh-huh Sure That's kind of uh to what we're doing is budgeting you know Month to month is uh kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra so that's kind of how we do it uh from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever Uh long term that's a little bit easier for us because uh with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings Four Oh One K plans uh that kind of you know retirement plans that kind of stuff so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see versus when it's on the paycheck and you have to try and take out some of that money You always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month so uh long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because uh it's automatically taken out So uh that works out much better for us so that's kind of how we do it anyway but E- exactly and if you can't touch it you can't spend it either So that kind of works out where you get into uh some plans that you know you touch it you're going to get a penalty that kind of thing so it leads you to kind of say well I'm not going to take it out I'm going to keep it and uh keep it in there and let it grow so that someway maybe for retirement you're going to have that money left Let's hope anyway so you'll have that so that's kind of how we do it But ours is more like month to month too uh short term is to get things going so Anyway other than that uh is kind of how we do it so I don't know if we're our time is up or what They'll let us know Uh-huh Oh definitely definitely And uh it grows uh it it seems like at first you're not going to see a big return but as the years go on if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better and uh so you know you just have to kind of look at it that way and there's other savings plans or other things that you can do Automatic you know deposit from checks to where you don't see it And uh you know exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent It's put into our savings account and we don't see it then it works out to where you know you don't look at it you just look at the checking account and say this is what we have for money and that's it so Yeah it it's easy because you do spend it that's for sure Like I said you know you kind of look at it uh you better have some other way of uh savings otherwise uh checking accounts aren't the best for you know long term type of planning so And you don't get a good return on it anyway so other Exactly Right now Yeah it's a bad time you know Uh-huh Uh-huh Exactly exactly You know we have some in-laws uh that uh had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and uh kind of took them out of that because they got so low but uh yeah it's it drops so your better bet is to uh try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of uh savings plans or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever so or some kind of profit sharing so Sure Yeah that's great yeah Okay Yeah exactly
