Okay Karen You- you're first Uh-huh Okay Yeah I guess one of the differences I see is uh working for a university uh there is room for advancement but not so much so our in uh quite a highly unionized environment and then also in the administrative association so there is a progressive path but not being in the say the commercial sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people uh like really Yeah somewhat that but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have uh a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances Uh so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution uh it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance and I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution perhaps somewhat even with the business uh But I agree you know the uh medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the uh security aspect for long term employment uh Job security yes Uh-huh Yeah we are seeing that here as well Like in some of the large oil companies There has been massive lay offs Uh so I I think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in uh institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back that's what we do But Yeah and institutionally like here at the university oh if there is a cut back well gee it's not where it necessarily where it's needed it's where it's most expedient which Well in one sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles So we It's very easy Yeah Right Because it's support people that are providing the speed for it Well the uh that's maybe the majority of the importance I guess Yeah because my perspective is from an institution uh the there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the limitation for reward is very severe but if you're in the corporate world I think there is considerable motivation for I guess in- innovation although he you know the more complex your structure the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through but uh I think there is uh it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's uh things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of the efforts Right Yeah You end up being your own person and uh if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up well then that's their problem and you know you really Yeah Yeah It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves
