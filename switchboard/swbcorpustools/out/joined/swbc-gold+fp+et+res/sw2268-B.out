Well uh normally I like to to go out fishing in a boat and uh rather than like bank fishing and just like to try and catch anything that's swimming because I've had such problems with trying to catch any type of fish that uh I just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing Uh-huh Uh-huh I've never tried like with deep uh sea water fishing because you get I get sea sick Well one of these days I'm hoping they'll have some kind of medicine so I can go out and go uh deep sea fishing Now that would be nice Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh my goodness Uh-huh Wow Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh I bet it is Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well uh now I haven't done much fishing here in Texas uh because I moved from Ohio uh but uh we did a lot of fishing when we were up there But down here I have a brother that likes to go over on the east in East Texas and do fishing I can't remember what the name of the lake is and he was just here this past weekend I could have I I think he mentioned it again but I couldn't remember what it was Uh I want to call it Salt Fork or Lake Fork I I can't remember but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places I you know that may be it That may be it Yeah Yeah yeah and he said that he has never gone anywhere before and he's fished all over the United States in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen So I would love to go over there They were talking about going over there and and some time in the spring and I was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing and uh and catch some bass Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah That's true Uh-huh Yeah Oh Yeah Uh gosh I think it was only like three and a half pounds and for me that's big That's why I'm saying I love to go fishing because I've never caught anything really really big Uh so because it's always been you know in the on a lake and uh I know they have bigger fish than that but you know three and a half pounds and that was huge for me yeah that's a good size fish Yeah yeah So uh but yeah I'd love to go ca- catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh That's right That's right Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Wow Uh-huh Yeah That's right that's right Right Right Well do you live like along uh Houston down there Well {E I meant when when you were when you were growing up I mean like Galveston oh okay But you uh Oh okay That's close to uh South Padre Oh Corpus Okay Okay Okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I I've been to Port Aransas but it was when I was a child Yes because I have relatives who live in Houston so when would go and we would go to Port Aransas or then on down to Corpus or further yeah like what your talking about Because I was just wondering we went to Galveston this this summer even with all the oil spills and everything I mean I was oh it was horrible I well never ever go back I don't think Uh and yeah and that that's true uh uh you know the the water was murky and I would hate to think about catching fish or anything there huh-uh no I wouldn't want to eat them So Yeah Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh It sure is Yeah Yeah It most certainly is so uh so that it it was it was certain things that were enjoyable about it but {F uh I don't I think it's lost a lot of it's appeal since then because of all the oil spills that they have had and uh it always smelled the entire time we were there It was Yeah We went swimming one time in the whole week that we were there and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool because the water was so awful and yeah Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh No No Not anymore Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Wow Uh-huh Wow Wow Yeah Now I never knew they were that that big huh Yeah Yeah Right Well it was nice talking to you Uh yeah almost ever day Yeah Almost almost ever single day from when they started it Yeah Okay Bye-bye
