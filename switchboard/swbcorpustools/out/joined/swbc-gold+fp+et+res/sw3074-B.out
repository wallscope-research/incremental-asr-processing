<> With the plastic Well I just I thought it was sad that they it started out as a good program two utts But then people started dumping trash and the wrong objects in there and I and that concerned me that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didn't want to set at the curb or take to the dump and and uh I it's too bad that people have to ruin a good part thing But uh Um Oh Doing it What did she do with if if she was she like a group that was doing it or was she doing it on her own and what did she do with the Uh-huh You you have to really want to do it though This is even even what you recycle because we we do the the plastics and the and the aluminum and the glass and the paper And um and of course then you know you try to buy right too but slash error Um a lot of our neighbors say well what you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure it's that sd and you have to it's uh we we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans And I thought what are you complaining about when you're only going to get picked up once a month you know or once a week and Rather than work with it Yeah Well it's for everybody's benefit I mean it's it's not so maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime but we you have to think grandchildren and great grandchildren and what kind of quality of life are you leaving them And and the and I have a real concern about that Uh We've never had much trash because wh- while I was raised in a big family and and Gene's family wasn't big but they weren't rich and they had to to recycle And and you know the fu- well they didn't they just used things they didn't throw things away before they were used up and Uh-huh Yeah Right Right Right They've picked up the hab- Well they do and when they actually get out away from the home and have to do their own buying of things Th- and then they say well hey you know mom used to do this and dad used to do that and pretty soon they're they're figuring out that's not such a bad way slash error with utt2; one utt to go slash error But % Right Well see this this is what concerns me You over in Europe they don't have the kind of waste we do here You you've got to be in a country even in in Mexico you don't see things thrown away like we do here I mean what we throw away is is a ransom a king's ransom to most people and I and even to people in our country who scavenge for food and and and I I think you have to get into a period of need bef- you can't tell a person that lives in a hundred two hundred three hundred thousand dollar house that have all that they need and all that they could want that they've got to be careful This is uh I this is why I thought Jimmy Carter was never very po- very pos- you know people didn't like him Because he tried to say turn off the lights conserve this do that And and uh the pe- I nobody wanted to hear it It's Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Um Right Uh-huh uh-huh Right Huh I I think the big question too we're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled That's that's right and and uh do we have to wait until all the landfills are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage Or and I don't with the mind set of the American public I think what they will do is start paying Mexico to take our trash slash error That isn't that isn't harmful sv Or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean That's the way we solve problems And it's sad
