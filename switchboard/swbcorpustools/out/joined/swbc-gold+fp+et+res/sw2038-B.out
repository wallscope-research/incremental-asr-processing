Okay I guess we're on Central America have you ever lived in Central America Do you do you think that that we should have given up the Panama Canal Well there are those that that that think that that that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic importance particularly for the military Interestingly enough my father was who was in World War One and as uh as a civil engineer they they they offered him a commission as a captain if he would uh go in and and uh help with the defenses of the Panama Canal He had worked for United Fruit Company there and they uh they in fact they had this was in the the late twenties and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over and uh he turned them down It it's interesting that that most people don't realize how small the canal is Have you ever been there It's it's really I I haven't been there I've been to been to Salvador and and uh in fact we went back to visit some friends of of my fathers that we went in fifty-seven I guess And interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite quite easily The thing I find interesting though is that uh is the whole colonial approach and and and do we do we support the Sandinistas or or do we support uh you know when they thought uh they thought that Nicaragua if you gave them a free election they would vote for the Will you uh did you ever studied the the political makeup there in in in Nicaragua Well the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic I don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama Canal but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua uh and uh there were uh there's a big there's a big lake and um from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua but the the United States uh had some and I've forgotten what the political influence was but there were economic ties then The issue of of if if it's in the economic interest of the United States uh do we go in and and prevail and and uh in other words do we make the world safe for democracy but if there's no economic benefit and I think particularly if you're if you're looking at the at the at the peasant uh whether he's in Central America regardless of where he is is his life is his life better off under communism or or uh or Democratic government You look at Salvador where the Yeah and and the question is does the government make a difference If they'll mostly leave him alone uh and I think that's the difficulty they that that we have that uh it it reality doesn't make uh doesn't make any difference if he has no income And apparently even some of our alleged uh Central American leaders that uh are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things so it's uh It is it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting them and and Americans have uh have a pretty good reputation of exploiting you know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and and took it and we stole it fair and square I think is uh Well what's going to be interesting is to the see what the economic impact of of uh of the the region uh you know at the moment it the tremendous drug traffic through there but uh the idea of of uh what's the what's America's role there and it it uh with with other things going on it it seems to have lessened but you've still got uh Cuba that accepts exerts some influence Well when you take a a situation where I think in particular in Salvador where there is a significant under class excuse me and that uh you know having a a lot of difficulty uh surviving uh the question is would they you know would they be better off under communism and I wouldn't don't know that I would advocate communism but uh the question is can uh can you can uh can a democracy uh afford the it's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the U S is that that's essentially an underclass and when you get enough of them uh you know communism would feed them all Well that yeah if the guys got some incentive if he's got uh you know if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas to uh where he's got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest Yeah as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments Yes but the but the question is you know if somebody offered you you know a thousand dollars a day to to grow something in your backyard would you do it Well not that we could be bought but uh Well of course everything we're saying is being recorded and Of course of course Particularly if you're hungry Uh starving to death is not a not a whole lot of fun either and that uh and and you know when somebody comes in an offers I think that's one of the real problems particularly when when the uh religious organizations you know the Catholic church has been accused of a lot of things In reality I think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves not that they I'm I'm not sure the Catholic church is is is particularly political but you know if
