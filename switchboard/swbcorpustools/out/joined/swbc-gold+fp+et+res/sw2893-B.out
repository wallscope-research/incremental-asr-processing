Okay do you rec- exercise regularly What do you do Okay I love to ride a bicycle Oh that's good I went an last year I went an was exercising on a bike for a while and I when I'd gotten back I had gotten some sun that day the sweat had built up on me and built up under my skin and caused me to peel It was the sweating not the burn that was wild But I exercise I don't exercise now I just had a baby three months ago I haven't really gotten back into exercising But I exercised real good for a couple of years It was aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week and it was running three nights a week What what's my motivation A friend of mine always pushing me This was in Louisiana And she would push you know she was hey let's go do it and you know she wouldn't take no for an answer Oh I ju- I just wanted to look good yeah it wasn't really health related Yeah yeah because I'm not I'm not big or anything but I'm not in great shape so But when I worked out I got in pretty good shape I didn't build up muscle though I just got real good and toned I don't think women look good with muscles Up to a point no m- yeah It's just some of those women that come up there looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it I guess it's a task 'cause I can't make myself do it lately Yeah You don't want to lose yourself Well how old are you Okay so you're still young We all are so It's not hard to stay well if you keep working out when you're young though when you get older you know your body's not going to look as bad I seen an old woman today she was about eighty and she looked so good I mean she was standing just as straight and tall and she had a small waist and she didn't have you know like you know how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle A- she didn't have that at all She her lips were a little bit wide but a lot of back in her time they liked women with big hips anyway so she may be keeping that on purpose so Uh-huh Well smoking ages you quick it puts those little wrinkles around your lips You get winded Oh I smoke a pack a day an I can't quit smoking I've tried I was telling a friend of mine that I'd be almo- almost as bad as being an alcoholic I can't quit smoking I've tried I just can't do it I quit when I was pregnant with my kids but you know as soon as I had them right back to it Yeah It was like you know that was the only reason I quit I didn't want to And I don't want to quit smoking I enjoy that I said I have very few vices I'll keep this one thank you But uh did you ever go to like one of those health clubs or anything Uh-huh I like to work out with people I need like you I I need competition is what I need I've got to have somebody to compete with or I don't want to do anything Uh-huh are you Uh-huh are you married or anything No well get your girlfriend to work out with you A lot of women like that I'd love it if my husband would ask me to work out with him He doesn't work out very often Course he don't need to He's small and he works as a laborer on the railroad So you know he's building his muscles up all day he doesn't have to do anything He can eat like a horse too And he don't you know he don't gain it like I do But uh Yeah you have to Well you can gain too much weight I gained a little bit too much but I looked with my first little boy I did gain a lot of weight I got I got about fifty pounds overweight with him and I didn't loose it until two years ago and then I got pregnant and you know ruined that so Yeah well actually like I say it ain't as bad this time because I was in shape when I got pregnant I wasn't out of sha- I wasn't overweight when I got pregnant with him I just wasn't in in shape I don't know the difference but About weight Exercise Well that's what my friend did Well she was she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else and really we was you know even with her taking all those e- expensive vitamins and stuff we stayed right on the same track with each other you know developing and everything Now there you can take those uh what is it Steroids yeah I couldn't think I was goin- I was trying to say hemorrhoids no I was trying to say hem- hormones Yeah hormones but yeah uh steroids But I stay from that crap Oh I wouldn't I could just see hair start growing out of my upper lip or something Really Ugh I didn't know it did that Yeah but I've been wanting to get me a bicycle or a bike I've been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around I'm scared to run for dogs Course I know dogs can get you on a bike too but seems like it Yeah Well they yeah they've come up that running is not as good for you as they thought it was Yeah it's real hard on your legs and it's hard on women And it it just makes stuff move down And uh but I I I like jogging I don't mind that I can get out and do that as long as it's not hot If it's hot you can't do that But in the rain oh I love to run in the rain just you know be careful not to slide But you can't ride your bike at all in the rain can you You slide Uh-huh Yeah Oh I when I did ride my friends bike that one time I had uh I don't know what I was trying to do I was trying to make a U turn and I never could make a U turn in a bike I can do it in my car but I tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked and I told her a dog was chasing me But I wrecked it into the curb I didn't hurt it too bad I scratched it on the the oh she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire I think But oh well Anyway it's been nice talking to you And uh Thank you she's it she's good Anyway have fun exercising All right bye-bye
