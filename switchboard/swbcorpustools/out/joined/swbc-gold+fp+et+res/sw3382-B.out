Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Have you been following the uh the progress of the space health code Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I think it's pretty exciting that they can uh it would be interesting to see if they can find uh other planets that are that will be more habitable to uh you know uh humans and uh yeah I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if uh if it you know if it is at all possible Well I know if they make the advances that they have been making that uh maybe age will no longer age or even physical uh abilities may not be uh a barrier anymore Yeah I agree Uh as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to Houston to to you know to visit the uh space center out there and uh one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro and uh that vacuum uh little space program was one of the big you know backers of that It's amazing you know you it's hard to imagine what life was like without it now Uh-huh yeah I've h- seen him before Yeah Yo- we were talking about that just the other day What did we do without it back then I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps That's right That's right Uh-huh That's true Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah that that is uh that is something that would be hard to think about I agree You know like you say we're used to finite things and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible But uh yeah I would like to see them uh do more in that area to make space travel more uh something that the ordinary person can uh en- enjoy Uh-huh Yeah Yeah me too I wouldn't even mind being not so much being first but just uh get out there and and just explore I think uh it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't or experience something you know indifferent Oh sure Sure Of course That's true Uh-huh Yeah that's true Yeah That's right That's right And if you are just content with being you know with the way things are then you know then you must lead lead a pretty dull life Because if yo- Uh-huh Yeah I guess uh you don't really think about it too much I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff but yo- it it's in a subconscious you know thing You know somewhere they can sit down and write down what you know things that you've improved upon you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list But you just don't think about them And that's true I think uh you know we've gotten different programs at work you know to to uh make it visible to management that we are doing things better
