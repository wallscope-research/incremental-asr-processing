Hi what do you do with your credit cards Oh jeez Oh I was going to say that that sounds like like pretty many But I see what you meant you had them for each of the individual stores Uh-huh uh-huh Oh gee Oh sure Uh-huh uh-huh But each of these had an annual fee also right Uh-huh Yeah forty five Right uh I Exactly you know I + that's it I  really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards so I sent back all of mine except the ones that were free And um then then I also limited it to one of each one MasterCard and one Visa and here most of the stores will accept those and actually I then got a Discover card since they pay you back Oh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh yeah Oh I see Yeah Uh-huh Yeah yeah Actually I pay off my cards every month Only once in my life have I not paid Right Uh-huh uh-huh Well and also in a sense they're giving you a loan for a month so that you know if I were smarter I would have that same amount in savings and get the interest which I don't do but but yeah the the thought of adding you know X percent to to the price of what I buy I just I can't accept Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh That's right that's right Yeah yeah that I would that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that I was you know juggling payments to different people I guess because I never experienced it And it's not because you know I'm rich or anything it's just a mental concept that I have Yeah that I just Uh-huh uh-huh Right right But it sounds like you know you you learned from it and you're coming out of it all right Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh But now the fact that you still have two cards are you do you use them more judiciously Yeah Uh-huh Purchases Uh-huh uh-huh Clothing sales Sales I find are a pain Uh-huh uh-huh Well it sounds good you know Like I said it sounds like you're you've really got it under control Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah and like I said once once it it happened I couldn't because my son's tuition came due and I guess I had you know not really counted on it quite at that point but um yeah I didn't like it at all I was very uncomfortable So You know and and I mean it was I thought a lot sixty dollars interest or something for for just a couple of months and I'm going jeez that's outrageous but in in you know retrospect it wasn't all that much I mean a lot of people pay a lot more and and you know but still I mean I figured I didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them Exactly Groceries for a week Yeah Uh-huh But now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax Uh-huh Right right Thrown away Yeah jeez You were good at it Uh-huh Yeah I suspect that you know thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and you know the amount that I know they buy I guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation and you know just don't talk about it Uh-huh uh-huh very personal Uh-huh yeah and especially if you if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be Uh-huh Right Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Right right But but once I suppose you you prove yourself by paying this off next year you'll be in very good shape Uh-huh Uh-huh
