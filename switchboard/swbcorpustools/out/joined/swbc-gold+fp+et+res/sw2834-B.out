Uh basically I'm at home and I have two cats and my husband I mean my husband's great It's wonderful you know and and uh so I'm about forty and whatever So yeah Yeah I'm just a spring chicken I guess Well Righto I think I'm ready Well let's see the changes I've seen in women's roles uh since I am in the forty age I'm a fifties baby uh and from my mother's generation to my generation it's just a very very wide uh it's been a big change Very much and I think you'll have to agree and and since we were in uh sort of the ground level the bra burning of the sixties and and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be uh and I think you know it got off to a really radical it has a radical fringe to it that uh I've sort of backed away from Yeah And to make a change you know you have to make a splash But to continue in that vein I think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas but I really do think that women have made a contribution uh to human beings I mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions and it's okay and I think uh you know on the other hand I don't know that men have changed that much So in in contrast to the women's changes uh you know the men stay steady and then the women change around them Uh I think men are trying But they don't have a national organization of men to uh help them out and uh what's changing them though is the economic situation where both team it has to be a team partnership now and they both have to work and they both have to raise the children if we're going to have any kind of future at all and and that I think has been the downfall of the last ten years You know the me oh I don't know the the yuppiedom the whatever it was the you know women didn't know how to go about doing the careers and they wanted to compete with men they wanted to be like men and that's wrong I think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men men Absolutely and so that's you know they sort of threw the thing back another you know ten years that they've had to you know restructure but I saw the greatest T-shirt the other day I got to get some for all my men friends it says let men run the world women have more important things to do Right But uh I think men and women both have valuable valuable assets to offer and you know we shouldn't we were made differently however you come to that conclusion we were biologically physiologically made differently and there is great wonderment in that and uh you know we should respect that in each other so Right And and you know just sort of all s- swooshed into one channel sort of thing it's it's viva la difference someone said that and I think that you can truly respect the other person I mean you know Tom is just always saying what a mystery you are you know you know Depends Yeah Well that depends on what day of the month it is But uh I don't know I guess we've gotten more of a in in terms of that I think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles and but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles and Yeah well that's that's a very different way to do you know the woman doesn't start off at home raising the kids and goes back into her career you know twenty years later Uh You do Yeah Are are you married Do you have children Oh my goodness Oh my How did you do Well I mean okay well did you have boys girls how did how Oh my Oh my Oh how exiting I I tell you what I don't know what I would do without my friends having all their kids I just love the babies and and since I'm sort of in a medical situation where I can't do that it's Just eight years just the most important years of my life you know Yeah it has been And uh so there have been major major adjustments but that's another story But you know my husband has  really really filled in the gaps I mean I I couldn't ask for a better life I mean if this is the way it had to be this is the best way I could possibly do it and and that has a lot to do with his strength and his just pitching in and and his being able to you know all all ego aside do a lot of things that really so when I say men haven't changed I guess I should look at my own backyard sort of thing and Oh yeah Yeah that's true I mean boy I mean I I would have had so I had so much guilt to begin with and the changes that had to take place you know where I couldn't do a lot of things and uh just adjusting to that that uh yeah that was a major change but so I guess uh in the end you know you each take your own situation and you and you deal with it the best you can but but but women I think are a whole you know sort of riding the course they're they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there I think the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation I think we're going to see a generation of kids that you know are just going to be a little bit uh oh not very nurturing I think Yeah but I wish they weren't so many I I wish they weren't role models for everybody because it's so dangerous It's dangerous for the woman too to think that she can do that and then when she can't you know the failure of that is you know her life sort of falls apart and she doesn't know who she is and she's Absolutely Well you know I think that's that's really I think it depends on what part of the country you're in Uh I I would almost just say that because you know down here in the south you know a woman's role is a woman's role sort of thing and you know Uh oh yeah yeah And and I think that uh you know career women still have a lot of problems here with the good old boys here in Texas sort of thing making career moves but Uh you know in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents uh it's just like the way it it has been for years I mean you know since the days of the pioneers around here That's the woman's role and it and it's hard for her to uh you know watch her peers be appreciated I think sometimes but then I'm not there so I don't know that And I have women that do both and I see a little jealousy on the part of you know the woman what has two little boys and and she has an au pair which is a live-in college kid working for her and then she has her business in the back and then my other girlfriend that has you know just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy all the time And so I see I little bit of that and I always wish there was a balance you know with the one and and wish she could spend more time with her kids and the other gal I wish she could just get out of Dodge for a while Get some peace and quiet Yeah definitely so You're right about that Yeah And that's That's true That's so true How how did your daughter do it Uh-huh Right
