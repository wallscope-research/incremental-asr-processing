Uh I have uh I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War um I I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening Um looking back like maybe some of the things that I know now I I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about because I because we never went to war I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out and I I feel like it went on and on And I I guess I see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for for what was happening You know I just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman and I'm not sure that's our role but Uh-huh <> Don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time I mean I do think that i- i- it's been too long in coming but I feel like maybe the American people and and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support that that those so many people were opposed to the war what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it and those guys were there doing their duty Yeah and I I think that we learned from that and I think it it's one of those things that you learn the hard way It was a tragic mistake the way that they have been treated over the years and I believe that's just now turning around Just now you know trying to be rectified and I'm and I'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally on so many of the people No they're not Yeah Well I I appreciate the fa- I feel like President Bush is in a hard spot He went over there to get them out of Kuwait which he did And then he has backed out he has pulled out And I realize they're still saying well here you're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein so why aren't you helping us And you see I think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation And I don't think the U S will stand for it I don't think he would do that uh I think we learned too much of the effects Uh you know whether it was justified or not I know that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause I I feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and and beat the communism but but I think somewhere that got lost You know in the long term effects of the of the war and Yeah Yeah That we don't get fixed I know And I I believe that we have to have a military and I believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us But I also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward Ye- I know I do think that in the Middle East war um I think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with uh kind of a different attitude Uh I think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more An uh and I think that's good you know I think that's a good I think so too And perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we had the experience of Vietnam So I I I do think that we've learned from it you know I I I wish there weren't war But uh I do think we learned Yes No there was no feeling of accomplishment no goal no we went in but what did we do We lost lives and and what were we trying to do Who knows And I I think you're right uh I think you're right there Um I do remember when it was over I remember when they were coming home Uh but I remember the feeling back then you know like I feel like right now I feel like this country has been behind this war Uh yeah there's a lot of people that aren't for war I'm not for war but I believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right I don't remember that feeling back in Vietnam I just remember oh yeah our guys are over there and it's sad and we shouldn't be fighting a war but there was no let's support them you know Yeah That's right slash error That's right That's right They don't see it as supporting the folks the people I would agree with you there I I agree Um and I and I recall when President Bush said that you know he said look I you know I'm sorry that you're opposed to the war There's a lot of us that are opposed to war but uh you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing And I remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that But Th- not That's true Uh Giving a soapbox to stand on But well I just I I'm glad we've learned I'm sorry we had the experience of Vietnam And uh and I'm I'm I'm especially sorry for the people that are you know have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally because you know until the la- past four or five years nobody ever really worried about that for them And and I think that's where we as American people really failed you know failed them So I don't know Well do you have anything else you want to say on this I think this is the first time that I haven't been cut off by the computer Usually I can talk all day but this is something to me that's sad So well have a good day and I appreciate the conversation Bye-bye
