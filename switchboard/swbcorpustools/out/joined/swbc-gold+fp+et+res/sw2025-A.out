All right Amy how are you doing today All right I think we know what we're going to speak about Uh I tell you what I'll start off How's that Um I personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals criminal cases that they should bring back hangings on weekends in public places There is one state that does that by the way I want to say Oklahoma I saw something the other night about it They don't do them real often Which is obviously the death penalty Um but I think if we quit uh building these Taj Mahals with the color T Vs and sixty dol- sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with and let's just screwing up the system That's pathetic That's pathetic This is true an and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to life in prison then he's available for parole If it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole So what you know let's quit B Sing with the system Exactly A life for a life The old Charles Manson case I mean the guy is really just shouldn't be allowed to to even even live Uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge The the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene uh when there's a my understanding when there's uh a verdict and it for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth today in eight to four and bam bam the guy got off Uh he was he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay Uh it kind of gets back to the second request we've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an unanimous verdict In a situation like that I'd say no let's just go like a regular vote Eight to four tells me that there were eight there's a certain perc- percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey they guys guilty Exactly Exactly because it's not next day they have the start the trial it's X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more I think that that if it's if it's not a split decision go with the highest number and let's just get on with the program But as far as the sentencing by the judge I would have to vote against that since there is a jury because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision Uh what are your feelings Um Yeah I get back to Price's comment when he uh was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods Well give me a break you know Exactly yeah yeah I mean you're you're in Dallas so everybody I can't believe they can uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence you'd have to be pretty dense you'd be you'd either have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to Lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer This is true so true Well this has been an interesting conversation So you're at the house you're not at the plant Oh that's good that's good I thought I heard a holler there in the background but I wasn't sure Oh goodness well I'll let you get I enjoyed it Bye
