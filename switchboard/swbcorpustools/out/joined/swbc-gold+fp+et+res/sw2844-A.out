Okay Well I heard Dallas is pretty bad with the crime Uh-huh Uh-huh The same way here in Dennison I mean uh back a couple weeks ago they found uh some people I don't remember at some fast food restaurant They had been I can't remember if they had been shot or if they had just been thrown in the freezer but I'm pretty sure they'd been shot and put the freezer at the fast food restaurant And I've worked worked in fast food restaurants They don't have that much money on hand they really don't Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Right My husband worked at a gas station when he was a teenager And he well I don't know he decided not to work one night or something and one of the guys that was working was shot and Kenny quit the next day He just he couldn't deal with it Uh-huh Everywhere Uh-huh It just seems like a lot of people are attracted to the bigger cities though the worst part of it Um I lived in Louisville Kentucky for a while but I lived on the outskirts too but Louisville was pretty bad especially during like the uh Kentucky Derby At this time of the year it's horrible to live in Louisville But uh Uh-huh The ones that blink off and on By themselves I mean Right Uh-huh How many kids do you have Oh a boy or Oh that's what I've got It is scary are your ba- are they babies or Oh well good That they're a comfort to you I've still got babies Okay I've got a a four year old He'll be four And a three month old And it's scary sometimes I'm used to living in uh which we don't live in the city but we just It's still more crowded than what I'm used to I'm used to having you know eight or ten houses on one street and this one's got houses on either side and you know real close together and just Right Oh oh well we think our neighbors are stealing from us actually my husband They uh well the one of them's a teenager that lives next door and her friends are pretty wild They've stolen gas out of our vehicles And so he went and got a locking gas cap for his They weren't stealing it out of mine so much because my car the gas thing is kind of weird where it's hard to syphon gas out So he he went and got a locking cap and they cu- tried to break that off And you excuse me He went down to Uba and noticed that it was hanging off where where they had tried to break it off And they stole our tailgate off his truck Well we can't say they did but We're pretty yeah it had to be somebody that you know could do it in the middle of the night and you know they'd seen it earlier Uh-huh Well the only thing that we can do as citizens is you know like uh watch groups that they'll have But they can be dangerous too I've thought about it You know that <> this isn't like walking around and looking for somebody you can get yourself into trouble Uh-huh Yeah Well I watched it on T V oh I guess last year sometime They'll break in at the day in the daytime and I hear that you know it's if you lock yourself out of your house and you try to get in your house it will you give that half the time it takes you to break in Uh a professional could break in in half that time Yeah It is Uh-huh I'm getting me uh I want a German Shepherd Um I don't want any of those ones that will up the kids but I do want a German Shepherd Because my husband will leave every once in a while for he works on the railroad And I'm scared here by myself And loud Uh-huh The Cocker Spaniels are loud Well that's now that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog That's a deterrent Because they know that that dog's going to bark But it's easy to fool a dog too you know throw them meat or um a a real intense burglar can just get another dog that's in heat From what I've he- you know saw it on T V Yeah it was And I maybe we'll meet up again All righty Bye-bye
