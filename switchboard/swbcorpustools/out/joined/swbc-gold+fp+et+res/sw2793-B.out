Uh you know I when I was much younger uh than I am now I I had wanted to go to the Peace Corps and uh it seems like I it it was something that I I really wanted wanted to do Seems like wanting to go to the Peace Corps was something that I had really wanted to do when I was young But uh I don't believe they accept you after you you know after you're married and you have uh kids and all that so I got into that and then I wasn't able to to uh participate Oh they will Oh I didn't know that Then there's no age limit Your kidding typo> you're Goodness I'm surprised I really had no idea Well I don't I don't really think that they sh- they should be it should be mandatory I mean well I don't know I it's that just might not be something that everybody wants to do I mean there are a lot of people who would like to do it and there are a lot of people who get into other things and they get all involved and they just you know don't want to or don't have the time I don't see how that can can make a better class of Americans to make everybody to make it mandatory for everybody to participate That's true Well I don't I don't think that Yeah are are you suggesting then that if if uh if I have to go and and do something for the country for two years that the country will compensate me in some way I I will be compensated for this I'm not just going to Okay <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh That that that's true But in even in our region there's an employment problem There's a lot of uh people gotten laid off lately You know from just companies like General Dynamics and and Texas Instruments Thousands and thousands of people are out there looking for jobs <> no I'm not I'm not familiar with that Oh Uh-huh I see and  that was + that was simi- that was some some program where people gave their time in trade for <> for money okay Uh-huh <> uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well then I guess there are a lot of a lot of things that people could do to contribute to the good of the country Uh-huh I I really don't see anything wrong with it I just don't think that it should be mandatory that every person have to do that Well <> uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh All right I wonder if if they didn't make it mandatory if they would actually get enough people volunteering to to do it that it you know that they would have enough I mean I I'd probably Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh well yes we have With with uh recent generations I I know exactly what you are talking about I I mean I know several people who do not wish to work Well they wish for the money and they they decide that they're going to get the money anyway they can with you know without uh without without working in the the traditional American job market Right So one other thing and they they get the money anyway they can Yeah
