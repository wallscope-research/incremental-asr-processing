Um personally I don't have a problem with it uh I think uh as far as uh protecting fellow employees protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do um it's justified On the other hand um I do agree that it's it's a it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work Um I would never I would never have a problem with anyone testing me but I can understand why people would object So I guess uh I guess uh I'm kind of mixed on it still at this point Uh-huh That's right That's absolutely right It it uh I guess it all comes down to uh you know a a definition of uh how much out outside activities affect your work and uh uh granted you know that any any kind of drug use on on company property and whatnot is is definitely not acceptable Uh uh I don't think anybody would ever argue that Or uh any any after affects carrying over into the workday but um you know I don't I'm not particularly concerned with what people do um after they leave for the day especially if I don't if I don't uh see any results of it the next day Well it it is it you know on the other hand you you've got uh you've got the uh the possibility of people oh you've got some people could be arrested for uh drug use drug dealings and things like that and uh if their if their employers name hits the papers and that it's it's it's a mark against them the company and uh you know what kind of people work there what uh That's right That's right Right E- even if it is you know a company policy of uh immediate termination or whatever they still have to replace them And uh there's there's a lot involved there I think I think the regular schedule stuff um that when you say everybody get out of it that's a good point I never really thought of it that way Yeah if they really can um I think the big- the biggest problem I've got is is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment Um as far as the new hires I I hired on just early enough that I I missed it Um where the new hires were concerned but uh not nobody no I don't think anybody questions that um testing someone as a as a precondition to being hired but um for the conditions that for our employment to change while you're on the job that's I I don't know that that's where I think that most people get upset It's uh you know it it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and uh It's just it it's a really tough question and it you know it people have have really quieted down after everything started but I still think there's a lot of there's a lot of resentment Uh-huh You bet No that's right Yeah I I know of some people who did uh it was it was indirectly related {D you know } they could always come up with other reasons but it it had a lot to do with it Just the the whole attitude because it's really uh it's just really it it seems so un- T I you know with the the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have um to all of a sudden uh search for attitudes and whatnot You know there's not a lot of pressure to to vote the right way or anything else around T I Like there like there is in some companies or at least you know from what I've heard but uh yeah Uh-huh No I Absolutely not you know it's it's it's you know if you hired me I'll be you know supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so uh you know let's let's stick with that original trust I guess But uh it's it's still it it still remains a tough question and it's there's a lot of you know the whole the whole department of defense uh reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot There's a lot of different things that uh come into play but that was I think everybody everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company Uh-huh I really don't think so Yeah I really don't because some people are going to are are going to risk it um it may prevent e- I I guess I guess what I'm trying to get at is if it if it if it does help a few individuals maybe maybe it's worth it Um you know it may prevent somebody who was was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot but uh I don't know if you know the it's it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation I don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much There there's still a big question in my mind that the the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of of mistakes on the testing is something that still bothers me It it's Uh-huh Uh-huh Absolutely And that I I don't know if uh I don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too E- even if you you know if you take uh a a drug that was presc- prescribed for you but the the prescription has run out you still had some left and you happen to take an extra penicillin well penicillin's not on the list but you know yeah I I think you understand what I'm getting at it it can still show up and it can still flag as a positive and and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent and uh those are the kinds of things that still can show up Uh-huh That's right That's right I even had friends when I was going to college who were in uh pharmacy school and they could legally um provide medicine to their family mens- frie- family members and friends certain medicines were were legal now I I I believe you know any of the any of the ones we would we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists but uh um there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and that can happen But uh Yeah yeah I think so You too Good-bye
