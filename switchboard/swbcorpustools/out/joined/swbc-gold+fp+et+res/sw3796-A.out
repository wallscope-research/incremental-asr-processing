Uh did you watch the Bulls this morning They won in a squeaker They won by they won by two points Uh they were behind as they headed into each quarter and then they came back in the second half and at the end I think they were uh looked they looked like they were closing it out and then Detroit kept coming back and uh Isaiah missed a three point attempt at the end and uh I think the Bulls won by two I think they do as a matter of fact One of the uh commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would uh if they continued at their current pace uh set an N B A record for seventy wins in a season Yeah they looked real good and Right Yeah well they they're they're balancing their attack and I think they look like uh they'll repeat although uh here in the Bay Area people are real impressed with what Don Nelson's done with the Warriors Should "although" start a new slash unit  I saw the the second half of the game last night and they were impressive Billy Owens looks like he was that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him Well they traded away uh Mitch Richmond or is it Tim Hardaway One of the two uh who along with uh Chris Mullen was you know though three were three of the best in the N B A and and they made a heck of a threesome and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens and uh Yeah oh yeah he's really worked out well They've got th- the Warriors have got a team uh and uh I think that will be real interesting to see what they can do They're ahead and the Lakers are down I guess in fourth uh position in the west and I don't know in the east I don't know uh is it Boston in uh first place Boy they've had a hard time They said they've lost a lot of squeakers Yeah How do people in Texas deal with Dallas Houston and San Antonio Do you for example like San Antonio in Dallas So there isn't much crossover huh y- Yeah Yeah it's true because s- San Antonio isn't that close to you are they No Is it Yeah so it's not something you'd drive Yeah I was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing They've done a good job I mean of course drafting a franchise like him certainly Yeah I mean that's I think the way it uh I think that's the way it works now in basketball You you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and you know uh Bird for the for the uh Celtics and Well it Well yeah Well I think you're right and I think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit and I think those things do make a difference and there are marquee players And I think I think Jordan and the and the Bulls have to be uh considered the likely favorites I don't know who would meet them in the west Uh I don't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year They were so disap- You know I wasn't I I d- I watched only a few minutes of it and I wasn't paying attention Uh and so I don't know uh But Phoenix you know Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs and
