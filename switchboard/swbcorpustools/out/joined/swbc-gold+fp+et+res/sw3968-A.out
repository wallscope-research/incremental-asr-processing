Okay I know I guess that I guess you consider just things that every day that would you would think of about See I'm a college student so I can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me you know that I think's like is an invasion of my privacy stuff like that But I think it'd be it is kind of a tough topic Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh golly You're like No you don't no Uh-huh Yeah They call late now I mean now there's I heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or some- See that's ridi- I would be so mad Really Huh How Really Huh I don't know I think like things that that I think's like privacy is like just like not going through my stuff like going through just like my clothes or my drawer just going through my stuff basically That drives me up a wall No see we're not and uh Yeah she'll take all my shirts and stuff because she can't wear like my pants but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff Man I'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses you know But still she'll just take them and she won't even think about it and then I'll like see her that day and she'll be wearing my clothes and I'll be like you know I don't like to borrow my clothes out you know I really don't So I prefer that you just not go in and get them because she doesn't even ask me Stuff like that really like that's an invasion of my privacy I feel like Stuff like that when you have your door closed people just walking in and stuff like that I was thinking like my mom I know this she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy is like going through her purse like if you ever needed money and stuff we always just give her her purse you know and she'll get it out or whatever I was trying to think I was thinking that's the only thing I could really think of that would really be Really Uh-huh Yeah get out of my cabinets That's great  Uh-huh See Yeah You could tell you know you put your stuff where it's Yeah That would drive that would that Really Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Then you start missing stuff and That's okay See that would that would make me really mad because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff just because I mean I know I have everything like a certain way and you know how it looks and everything Uh-huh child_talking That would bother me definitely Uh-huh See yeah You know That's the only thing I can really think about being an invasion of privacy like something every day though Uh-huh Oh really Uh-huh
