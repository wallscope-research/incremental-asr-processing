So how you like New Jersey Right I guess uh I don't know what part of New Jersey you're in but I guess it's uh fairly industrial Right uh-huh Yeah Yeah <> Right Right Well I don't know about you but I've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor I mean there's a lot of contributors but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that Yeah That's yeah that's that's a big issue is you know a lot of states don't have a uh inspection law so you get you get a lot of people out there without E T R emission control systems on their cars and things like that Yeah and it's like Sure Right I guess from what I hear though uh next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars They're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California Yeah Right I hope I I'm hoping that comes along quick Uh I was reading a an article in TIME the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going and I guess it's it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize and I know that's not due to uh it's not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the C F Cs but Uh yeah I think that's a that's a contributor definitely Right Right Yeah I guess right now what they're what they're primarily worried about is third world countries because I guess United States and and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating C F C production but it go ahead Uh-huh Right And that's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes if if that makes any sense Uh in terms of Exactly Exactly Uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments but uh I don't know that's that's kind of an interesting situation there Uh what they don't realize those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting I guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the Poles and it's it's increasing even as far near the Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places So it's kind of an interesting situation It's not not a real good one actually But Yeah Uh-huh yeah Yeah you don't get that that source of cleansing anymore Are have you been in big cities a long time Okay so you've got Yeah those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard I would think Yeah Denver's definitely yeah that's one of the worst Sure Yeah Denver's that that real good e- that real good uh example of sitting in a valley kind of like Mexico City does I guess Mexico City is historically been one of the worst in the in the world for that But I've been pretty lucky I've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although uh I'm really kind of based in Orlando Florida and there you can tell that it's getting worse I mean it it definitely it's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver but you can Exactly Yeah And there's not that much in terms of of public transportation down there There is but it's kind of it's
