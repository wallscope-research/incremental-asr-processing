Well I think they're a necessary evil Uh I wish the government would operate on the same premise that uh businesses operate on and that is uh you you don't spend more than you than you bring in Well I it just depends Uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity and so is uh utilities they supply and police and fire department uh you know they need to make a living So I think for for for many years uh we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are uh to a great extent public servants uh we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society But uh then again uh it's the hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of of uh government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments Uh you're very fortunate We just try not to pay any more in than we have to uh we pay in a substantial amount Uh We don't regret paying taxes We do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax And progressive tax I think uh does not give people incentive to make more money and what I mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay It should be I think a flat percentage and uh that percentage ought to be an equitable amount Uh last year when they passed the tax laws for the uh nineteen ninety ninety-one whatever nineteen ninety-one uh I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else and I totaled them all up and basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax Now that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every for every item on there even though there's uh taxes on different things But you know there's f- there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying uh like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your your tank But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes Yeah <> if you impl- implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money and the what people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes And so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point I'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs And so Based on that who do you think you're talking to you're talking to an employer
