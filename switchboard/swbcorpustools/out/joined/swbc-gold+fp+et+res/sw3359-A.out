Oh I guess uh this is a a topic near and dear to my heart since I am a am a healthy eater Well I'm not uh I there really isn't any kind of particular food that I I don't don't like really and I like a good Italian restaurant or a good uh uh especially like good prime rib so if it's uh nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that and I live here in uh Rome New York and there are a lot of good restaurants around here Uh-huh Uh-huh Really Oh no I'm in upstate New York and it's actually very inexpensive I there's a there's a place um half a mile from me here that uh has uh fantastic prime rib for oh eleven dollars for a whole meal you know a potato and salad and soup and the whole whole nine yards so that Right Uh I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever had so I'll have to go there when I get to get to Dallas Uh-huh sure Uh-huh No no I'm not into the the don't do the the raw raw fish like that but I do like uh like a seafood bar like a raw raw bar like oysters and things like that uh that they uh I go on I'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business so I uh find myself down in Melbourne Florida about once once a month once every two months or so and uh go and hit the the oyster bars down there quite a bit but I love that Yeah and um and uh Maryland's great you get the crabs it's like I can't go anywhere where I where I don't enjoy myself so That's true Yeah well uh it's really strange that that that seafood is so expensive because when you in reality uh uh I say that uh the oceans have the greatest re- resource of food on the planet and yet we haven't as human beings haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically so we managed to uh figure out how to get at just about everything else but uh but not uh not seafood Yeah yeah I like uh I make a a wicked chili and around here the big spicy thing is like uh buffalo wings and so uh it people they you know you go out to get the chicken wings and those are really hot and the hotter the better Right Sure Yeah Uh-huh My generally my my scalp will start I can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot the weirdest weirdest sensation almost like a tingling but uh I don't know but uh yeah well there isn't isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like Things that are kind of oddball like uh Thai cuisine I never been really fond of that stuff You talk about spicy that'll that'll literally blow your head off it's so hot And uh and I can handle just about any kind of food without uh um well but that that stuff is goes one notch beyond uh my tolerances So Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the uh service in a restaurant is always nice though too that's one thing What's that Yeah Well I find that lately that so many people are working you know working waitressing jobs or waiter
