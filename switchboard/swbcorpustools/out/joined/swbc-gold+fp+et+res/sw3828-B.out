Well I think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the or a lot less of the time than they're given by the court system but I don't know with the economy the way it is I think crime can't do much but go up Right Well there was an article in our paper Sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in North Carolina the average serves six weeks Well see we don't have any room in our prisons so They shu- they shuttle them in and shuttle them out and they get them get them early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks and then they're they're paroled uh to make room for the newest criminals and it just it it's just really absurd I think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now so many different things coming in so many different directions that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize there's abs- or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it Yeah Yeah Well I don't know what the answer is but I know that asking the question over and over and over again isn't working so Uh I hope so Oh I definitely believe in capital punishment It's when they it's when they're in on death row for nineteen years that I don't I'm kind of c- curious about Yeah you can appeal now in North Carolina for almost a period of twenty years Yeah you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go round until you I think the I think it's uh the average is eight to ten years to get in to the North Carolina Supreme Court and then uh after that it goes to the Supreme Court of the United States and that usually takes another four to six years So it's They're hoping I guess they're what they're h- they're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did But it's just a we have a serious problem We have so many problems in this state now and and the the thing is the the thing The fundamental problem is the is
