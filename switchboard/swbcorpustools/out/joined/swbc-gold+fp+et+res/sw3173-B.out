I think our next car I would like something like a an economy car that gets really good mileage and uh one that's really reliable I would I think probably not a a brand new car but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra Or something like that uh something my husband Oh absolutely air-conditioning and a radio uh A M F M and a cassette player and uh what else do I want Uh I would think kind of a subdued color would be nice You know a a navy blue or a Yeah that's what it would be for is for him to drive back and forth to work I think that's something we might want too is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic I think we would want one that even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that uh you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed Prob- well probably probably that would be a good idea yeah That's right So if we wanted it to take people out it's that's a good thought I that hadn't crossed my mind Yes I would go for that Well thank you for calling All right Bye
