Regarding uh taxes I you know taxes are really a necessary evil and in a civilized society But really people get upset at taxes because you it's more efficient to do things yourself And uh and so as as a result uh you know it's it's a trade-off you know for the common good you know For for the benefit of others you know How much of your resource should you dedicate to uh making things work for others Have you uh you know ever thought you know just how much of that money should should go to other people that really don't deserve it Well the thing of it is if I wanted to just uh you know permanently become a book reader I guess I could just uh you know uh go on public assistance uh you know lo- lo- look for uh look for people to uh take care of me And uh probably a good woman right Just you know just just con somebody to take care of me And then you don't have to be on the tax roll But uh but taxes are are very difficult kind of thing and everybody really hates it It was very timely I I I always over pay my my deductions so I wind up with my getting money back on my uh from my uh withholding So uh you know that that's always a smile But of course you know I've I've paid it in and I should calculate it better No I I I work for the F B I So I I'm a federal employee Yeah Guess I don't sound like it huh Yeah I belong Oh I I've got all four feet in the trough you know being a federal employee And and so but but I can understand that uh that you know the uh who gets benefits Like every every time there is a a bond issue you know I vote no on every one of them I'm I but there this is this is tax not tax revolt country I mean there's too many every one of us most of us have our have all four feet in the trough you know Plus our snout right up to our ears So you know it's not exactly that kind of a place that that you want to you know get into a tax revolt situation But uh uh the uh the local taxes here I I i- in this particular area uh you know I've uh I think I pay about uh oh thirty-five hundred for for taxes on my four bedroom house you know And which is a lot of money An- and uh and so as as people get older and older uh you know they think about retirement and that sort of thing and and they they're building old peoples homes uh you know at tax expense Well I think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper At thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars I'm paying in taxes why I I could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a rent a house for that right You know In in instead it's it's the taxes here so Course I don't know whether I want to go to Bulverde or not you know or Seguin or someplace like that But uh there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer And and I think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer If you're not going to use them then you want to be in in environment That's a strategy I think tha- that the people have to have to take Is is how to be able to to lessen their cost of living You know I'm I'm five or six years before I'm eligible to retire and and I'm saying well you know I really can't stay here uh as a retiree It's too expensive I'm going to have go out and you know in you know East Fork someplace And and do my thing you know Right They they redecorated in nineteen seventy-five you know And they're not doing it a- again you know So Well it's certainly uh uh you must be a T I employee You must be a T I employee You're not a T I who do you work for You you're
