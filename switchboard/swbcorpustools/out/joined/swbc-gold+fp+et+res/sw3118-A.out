Okay do you want to start Uh-huh Now that do you do you agree that they should all be unanimous Or even even in uh like they said you know lesser you know trials you know lesser convictions do you think that they should be all unanimous still Uh-huh Uh-huh Well the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous I mean if one is determined that it's you know that he feels that he's you know going against the other eleven they all stay until everyone agrees So I don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting you know just gives in And they have to stay in until they all agree yeah I don't know I'm not sure if they go I mean to twelve new people or what they do exactly but I do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before  he can either + you know either he or she can either go free or to jail either one Uh-huh That's that's just it I don't understand You're supposed to you know go in if you have you know like if you've never heard of the people before or anything but I don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are total totally impartial to it Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I agree I don't think it should be left up to the judge alone Not only you know that they have to stay in there but hey how many times have you heard of judges being bought over You know so it it's I I think I think in in the end the judge has the presiding you know uh vote I think he can be you know I I don't know if it's the way it is in real life but I've seen it on T V where the juries go one way and the judge to- totally finds it obnoxious and he completely you know goes the other way Now I'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what Uh-huh Yeah Oh oh my God If there were more than twelve can you imagine how long they'd be sitting I I think it's just I don't I mean I think it's as fair as it can possibly get but I just think it's really har- you know I mean some cases go on for years you know Uh-huh Yeah I I don't know how it could be more fair Course I don't know Maybe maybe they should be asking someone that's been on on trial before Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh I know I don't know that much about it either I just I don't know I I guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail you know how they can make it more fair for them or not but then again maybe they should be there so that is fair I don't I I don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way Uh-huh Yeah Oh I think we can hang up anytime No I don't what else to say so It was nice talking to you too Bye
