Uh-huh Well I have a long experience with cars when I was younger my brother had a Corvette and I bought a Corvette and when you have a Corvette you more or less do all the work and I've done everything from build the motor from you know the bare block on up And I'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car I hate to go pay somebody good money you know I hate to pay somebody twenty-five dollars on hour for something I can do myself It just to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that In fact I just this past weekend put new plugs in both my car an my wife's car And so I pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything I can do myself but I've gotten to the point in my life you know I just crept over forty years old where I don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore I don't know whether I've just reached a point you know it's real rough in the winter time And so I try to make sure that by the time fall runs around because we actually have winters here on the east coast that you know the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter and then springtime I usually end up giving them a tune-up and make sure that they're running well and you know it's like I had the muffler go out on my car shortly before it was required to go in Maryland they have emission tests And you're required to get your car and go through the emission test well my muffler of course starting going bad right before I was supposed to go to the emission test so You know I had to do that job and of course that was back in December when it's nice and cold outside But the thing was that I could do the job myself the parts cost me roughly a hundred dollars if I'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty-five Now like who's got that extra two and a quarter I know I don't Yeah Yeah I don't mind it there was a time when I had my Corvette of course I loved it but if you know I've got other interests now and there's a lot other more important things I think I should be doing with my time And I have the same problem you can tell him from me but it doesn't matter I've had greasy fingernails for years And it still takes me twice as long as I think it's going to take to do the job so but I think the difference is that when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right and you know I've in the past I've had brake jobs done by someone that when I went back and looked at it some months later I'd find something drastically wrong with it you know like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident You know those kind of things and when you have a vehicle that's being used by you know other members of your family you know you don't want that kind of a situation to come up And it's very very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust I only have one guy that I know that I trust to work on my car And he's about sixty miles from here And so it and if I have something that's really major that I can't handle or feel I don't have the time to handle I'll take it to him to do it Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah that's probably something that you know is good for both of them I know that my older son I could never get him interested in cars and I couldn't you know I just like you know you sure you're a boy your not interested in cars he just would not have anything to do with them And later on and like when he you know grew up got out of the house got his own car he didn't know how to do anything to it absolutely nothing he couldn't even check the oil that's how uninformed he was and disinterested And I guess there are some people out there like that you know I always thought maybe you know if he took more of an interest and you know what I was doing and maybe we could have communicated better But yeah I think that's great I trained my wife in the hou- in doing things in fact when I first transferred down to Texas Instruments back in nineteen eighty-seven when I left here she had to change a set of plugs on the car because she was up here for a month or so after I was and it was an interesting experience for her she'd always assisted me and done some other things but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was something a little different Yeah yeah I think it's important that everyone know you know basically how the darn engine works it helps you figure out what's wrong with it you know I've been out with my sister before when you know her car died on the highway and I happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all
