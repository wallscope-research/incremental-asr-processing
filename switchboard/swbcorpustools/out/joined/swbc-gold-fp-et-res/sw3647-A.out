Brian in Plano Texas How are you doing today Great Nancy You're in Plano also Well good to hear I was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania Really All right Well good to hear good to hear Which one yeah The Utah Jazz Yeah they're pretty good They've got some good good players out there Well you ready for New Year's Eve Good Should we start this so we can What was your name again Nancy that's right and I'm Brian Just a moment Okay Nancy then I guess today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary what do you feel are important to you or other people as crucial benefits Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh to compensate for some of the benefits Oh Yes Well that's an excellent so actually that is a benefit Yeah Right Right well I guess that's a good point I do belong to a large corporation or that where I'm currently employed and there's some different things one that you've already mentioned is health insurance I think through our health insurance that I can get better rates through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because I had to do that at one time when I wasn't employed with a large corporation and that got to be somewhat expensive so I think one of the benefits I see is the group discount Yes Yes and that's one thing I do have If I didn't have a family I don't think I would have as a male or as an individual in this stage of my life I don't think I would have insurance I don't think I would go through that expense One other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job I really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where I could go and I could work nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours or I could do work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a you know three day weekend And make my job flexible in that case Well basically yeah I had to do that the same for about every quarter of the year because I was in a position of management I had responsibilities over people that I needed to make my schedule so that if I was not there I would have coverage by some other management personnel so I think that that was an excellent benefit that I really enjoyed and I don't have that in my current operation but you mentioned flexible work schedule and that's good And what other benefits do you think are important Yeah yeah that's true Well and that's an individual thing Yeah with our current organization we do have a nice retirement package and also a nice thing that we have in our corporation is a profit sharing plan where we can participate in the profits of the company you know if we've been there a while and we're vested which means that you know we have an interest in the company that we can get some of the benefits of either the profit high times or in a sense suffer during the low times and also in one of my wife's companies where she worked they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that
