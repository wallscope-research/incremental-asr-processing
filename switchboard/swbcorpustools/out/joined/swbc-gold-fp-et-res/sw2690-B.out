it's kind of hard to put my finger on a favorite T V program however one that I've been watching for a number of years is DALLAS And it's going to be going off the air let's see a week from tonight It's going to be its last show So I've I've kind of enjoyed watching over the years I've been disappointed in it and also pleased in it And I was greatly disappointed when I did move down to Plano to find out that the great South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house Uh-huh well That's a shame Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh Yeah Well it's it's when you look at the you know route seventy-five coming down there it's actually a bridge but it's a bridge over top of roadway There's no water there Yeah Well there well they I think when they open the show up they give you two different views of Dallas One from the east and one from the west And that's why But it kind of confuses people But I enjoy a lot of different comedies I think it's mainly for an escape you know my job is not the most thrilling in the world and I enjoy laughing and some of the shows that are on the air some are just purely you know brain drainers And then there's other ones that deal with in a funny manner socially relevant things And one show that comes to mind is like DESIGNING WOMEN Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yes Yes it has been very entertaining and also the issues they deal with really tends to open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems And I've really enjoyed that one since it came on I don't like the politics surrounding the program though but other than that you know there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses But and then I've kind of gotten hooked on P B S stuff public T V I like things like NOVA and some of the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff I just enjoy watching that stuff Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well I'm one of those rare guys who I rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event if ever watch one there's just not that much I'm interested in for a while I watched some football but I've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and watch a baseball game Uh-huh Well I think it was great when they were you know like world champs and they were doing real well I personally I came from the Washington area And so I was a big Washington Redskins fan And when I came down to Dallas you know I found myself rooting for the home team I in fact I have a baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker the only year they played together on the Dallas Cowboys wow Huh slash error Yeah should be independent slash unit Huh No I haven't seen that Uh-huh Uh-huh Gee I'll have to try to catch that sometime It's Yeah that's probably true Yeah we don't either I couldn't rationalize paying you know it's like if I pay for a movie channel then I have watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them And you know if I didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic well I can get that for free And well I really don't need C N N I see enough bad news all the time I don't need to see more of it So I've kind of rationalized that it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see And of course when we were living in Texas it was real convenient with Tom Thumb You know having movies back then it was ninety-nine cents go Yeah You can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like H B O or Cinemax Uh-huh yes I do too Yeah And I've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty and you know she just doesn't like them And she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie And I've told her you know everybody I know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick And so I'm hoping I can get her talked into it soon   That's great Yeah But as far as regular T V shows I've got some shows that I would be afraid to admit to you that I've actually sat down and watched And then there's others that I wish I had time to see It's like I enjoy watching CHEERS It's very funny Some of the things in it are mindless but I just don't have time to watch it I think about the only night that I really sit in front of the T V set all night long probably is on Monday night Because I work so hard over the weekend doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday Monday night I'm just worn out So I kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and look over things And I can sit in front of the T V set and look at you know go through my mail and watch T V at the same time Uh-huh
