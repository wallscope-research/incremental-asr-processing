Huh Okay Well I don't know if I know anything or not but I've got some opinions on it See those type of people that have the most opinions ones that don't know anything Well I've had teenagers and I now have grandchildren that are teenagers and I don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective I think this "me" generation has gone far too far And the young people are overly impressed And I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint I personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though But they have I read somewhere and I'm out on a limb here some type of college volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the lower income brackets of the United States Have you ever heard about that one really And this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education But she got credits for it That's very interesting Huh Yeah I think that is an excellent program I really do I like that And it's beneficial to the small towns too because they really have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the Metroplex Right you know if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldn't be convenient but we could find one We wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that So I can see the advantage to that one The Peace Corps itself is really dying out isn't it It's still in existence I want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm dig their own wells set up their schools Yes They It's not a program to teach them to use the American money it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant And yes you're right I think it's a sixties program I think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he that was his big deal Right Right <> I think I've singled out my grandchildren but actually they're pretty good along those lines as compared to what I have seen from other people's children and grandchildren mine aren't really that bad but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good But there's a Mandatory just like the draft No Every time you They could buy their way out Right you know they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat But <> I'm wondering if there's another issue here and maybe this is why this has died out Can you go into and this wasn't the question but it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults can they go in there and can anyone go well out of the Kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time but say I think Bangladesh would have been a good example or some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and it doesn't do any good I don't know that it does I don't know that if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out You know we're losing certain races of people There are people now that are obsolete point and fact just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people that are endangered or obsolete And I'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out There's a German word for it that's elegant but I never can remember what it was but they're being winnowed because where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially and one of the quick examples is the Aborigines when we were in Australia <> sad little things I felt sorry for them Because their society isn't there anymore and their belief system and all the structures of their society are gone essentially And they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else and that's sad But I don't think there's any way the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people and I don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either So I'm wondering if the Peace Corps is really an effective tool Good point We've got enough without a passport there's plenty Yes I think we ought to worry about our own species I wonder now in and I've been out of school too long to answer this but I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses That's the last thing you want to do Yeah that's exactly it They're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it Now come on let's be realistic that's just not realistic Right No we're not I don't think I think that's more realistic than making them go in the Peace Corps I think that's a lot more realistic I think that we should be spending more time and again I don't think the Peace Corps is as successful now simply because It doesn't fit the circumstance anymore we've got plenty in fact we've got far too many You're in what Flower Mound I was that's exactly what I was going to ask you have you been downtown recent-
