the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a long term financial plan and monthly budget The only thing I do now is put the data into Quicken I don't know if you are familiar with that Uh-huh I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then well not bother to total it and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic So it really helps with that Uh-huh Well actually we haven't had to until just recently I guess we've got a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way so we needed to start doing more of that just for you know saving for college and things like that We try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that Uh-huh  Sounds good Yeah I guess we're just at the point my wife worked until we had a family and then you know now we're just going on the one income so it's a lot more interesting trying to find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to do it You know kind of enforce the savings But it will be interesting to see   That sounds good But I was just curious what part of the country okay Cincinnati actually I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with the western accents or something like that I don't know how many people are getting involved in this but well that's interesting actually I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by reading TELECOM DIGEST or was there another okay Yeah that is how I got it as well but Uh-huh Yeah It would be interesting to see how the data base so well I guess we're talking about the experiment probably need to try to get back on the topic but it's hard to talk about finances without getting to dollar figures I guess you know we could talk about some of the long range goals and well I think either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that It seems like every year my employer just gives back you know a little bit your tuition reimbursement they use to reimburse one hundred percent and now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class and it's a real shame from what we had before because we're
