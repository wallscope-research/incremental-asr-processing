Do you have any personal feelings on the subject Uh-huh uh-huh So outrageous I know I know Right Well I guess my concern is what we are reading especially in Texas right now with them letting the people out of jail as soon as they are out of prison and having them go right back the day they get out back in crime And especially when they are assaulting people and then killing people the man who killed those three sheriffs deputies he is out free walking the street I have a real problem with that I think so Right Right Well slash unit since A's next turn does not pick up this false start Does not have the right  slash error Right slash error Right Right And meanwhile the witnesses move and die and they and there's no one to face them Right Right Well they can not get any if the judge is going to have any award to the victim it just puts off their collecting it probably should be cannot it's really bad it I Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh A time limit too Do not let it Seems that this is continued in A59  drag on for fifteen years See note above  Right Right Do you feel like there's any certain type of crime that this should be the results they should be consequences of capital punishment or are there some murders committed that you think leniency should be shown Uh-huh Okay Right Uh-huh And how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are because they have had them they have had them killed when they have  slash error That was their goal slash error Oh That would be premeditated slash error They killed him slash error Uh-huh Uh-huh No Well that's right there's no reason for murder I do not care if you are poor or if you are rich or if you are ugly or what that's just beyond the I think this giving excuses is pretty prevalent I work in the school district 2 slash units  and all these kids they have got an excuse for everything And I can see it continuing on when they are adults I just it's just a bad habit kids have got to learn from the time they are real little there's no excuse for + for  being bad or making bad choices deliberate or anything 2 slash units  It's it's I sometimes think if I were on a jury and had to make the decision could I And I like to think I could like you if especially violent crime where serial type killer or maybe a child has been deliberately killed Right Uh-huh
