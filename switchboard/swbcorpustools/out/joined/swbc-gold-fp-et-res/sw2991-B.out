No I don't not at home I work with them quite a bit though okay Well I think they're useful I think in some instances they're over used well that's not the right way to say it Well I think that some work places where I've been they set up like every body has their own P C which a lot of times everybody doesn't need a P C and it really without them knowing how to use it properly it slows them down more than it helps them accomplish something They spend more time messing with the P C than they would actually accomplishing the tasks that they're trying to do if they didn't have a P C at all Uh-huh that's true And you have to you know be familiar with it like there're so many different software packages you have to be familiar with the one that you're going to be using most A lot of times people know about half of the capabilities of a package that they should know to actually be able to use it properly and so they waste more time with their trying to figure out how to do you know other things than they would if they actually understood what they were trying to do You know like they want to format a report a certain way and if they really understood the capabilities of the package they could do that in about you know half the time that they spend trying to figure out how to do it without spending the time to learn the package properly Right exactly Uh-huh A lot of times they do it manually on the computer which just really is a waste of time and then if they ever have to change anything in the document they have to go back and redo it all manually whereas if they had learned the package properly to start with and had set it up correctly the package would do that for them whenever they wanted to make a change so I've seen that as a problem Right but in some cases the with the formatting what I'm talking about is that they set up a certain document and it may be eight pages long And they set it up manually so that they have all their spacings and formattings and tabs set manually And then when they have to make a change say they want to insert a paragraph They got to go through the document and reset all the page breaks manually and rewrite the whole thing instead of having the if they had set up the formatting on the system itself it would do that for them and save them a lot of time But a lot of people don't spend the time to learn the package no no you can left and right justify the whole thing It comes out just perfectly spaced like a block it'll automatically it's like typesetting It'll automatically do that for you Usually it doesn't divide words They usually have it space the words in a rather than divide a word So you see like in a newspaper they typeset They don't usually break words in a newspaper if one line is going to be a lot shorter than another line they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines Right And most computers do that most software packages will do that for you I've known people that have used a package for five years you know and I would say well you know you know more about this package than I do how do you left justify And they would say I don't know And it would take me maybe two or three minutes looking in the manual to figure out what command it was that caused this to happen And they would say how did you do that And I'm like well it's really easy And they were like well I never knew that So obviously they'd never considered looking it up you know Sometimes it's sometimes well it's a number of different things Sometimes they don't think that they can get any information out of the manual Some manuals aren't really designed very well But some of them are and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that just a basic general user can understand them So I think people think it's going to take them a lot longer to learn it properly than it really would and so they're really wasting time rather than saving themselves time because they think well it's quicker just to do it myself when it's really not Well I think so Uh-huh Exactly Uh-huh With P Cs they're either I B M or I B M compatible mostly That is you know the industry standard Uh-huh There's a lot of really good I B M compatibles too They don't have to necessarily be the I B M brand but they have to adhere to that industry standard probably Okay Bye-bye
