Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh They set that up for you Uh-huh And what kind of running do you do Uh-huh Uh-huh is just aerobics or No I mean the running you do a mile in about eight minutes or less Uh-huh Yeah then you don't get out of breath Oh Oh But it's not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make six or something like that Right Uh-huh Yeah I don't run much any more I did when I was in school Right now I just lift weights and do push ups and sit ups and I jump rope a little bit and that is about it And I don't lift any heavy weight they are about a third of my body weight Yeah and I play the trumpet and the the more upper body strength the easier it is to play You have to do a whole lot of sit ups and then I hurt my neck about three years ago So you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from hurting yourself when you play high you have to do it correctly you know it is like an exercise in itself but a lot of people strain themselves doing it I play at Church Yeah Uh-huh Well yeah well the weather is nice except for when it rains you know in Dallas Yeah I keep thinking about it but that doesn't mean it gets done I mostly jump rope more You know Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I do a toe lift and squats for that But you know it  doesn't doesn't  accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you are running for a long time They tend to tighten up whenever you have to do something at great length of time And it also builds too much mass if you just you know So I lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do the squats with And then it doesn't bother me very much Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah I have started doing more push ups and it has helped a lot and then I add sets to it so that I don't like you said wear it out I don't try to push it so the end in one set
