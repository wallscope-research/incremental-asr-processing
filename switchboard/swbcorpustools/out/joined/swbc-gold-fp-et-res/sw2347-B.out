Um all right Uh-huh Oh well I tend I tend to agree Uh in some ways I think it's uh I think if anything a lot of um the changes that have occurred uh in some ways they're for the better because I think women should have a choice and I do believe in the being able to have a choice as to as far as what you would like to do with your life But by the same token and I know this for myself because I've worked and I've not worked um that it makes it uh sometimes it makes life more difficult I think when the roles now are less defined as far as you know what uh women should or should not be doing that it it it could make life more difficult There are more things to work out I know when I was working you know you have all these problems with with the child care and and with uh pleasing you know your boss on the job so you have added stresses from there and then you still have all the things that um that you need to do at home and that doesn't change you know just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't uh make those other things go away and the other responsibilities are still important Um so um have you have you worked outside also and um feel that it that well how do you feel as far as uh what would be a happy medium or or what would you like to see Yes Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes Yes Right But yeah Oh I think so Yes Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Children Well what do you think {water running} though um um I don't know I the the one problem I guess I have and maybe what so many women younger women now are choosing to go outside is I feel that in general in this society that being at home is not looked upon as um a job in itself Whereas you know you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself but I know when I was working and I was a- an engineer so I was always with men uh and they were single many of them and I tried to explain to them well my day doesn't end when I leave at I used to leave at three I keep going to eleven at night and they had they used to look down on women that were home they'd say oh I bet you go home and you know at least you get out of here at three and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas and I used to be infuriated because they really had no idea what was involved once I got home Now taking care of them running them everywhere helping with homework the bath the whole you know everything Um and I think that one reason that so many younger women feel im- i- compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected and that being home is not a respectable uh position in society And there's a lot of truth to that and I don't know how you feel I don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got but I can see with the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home And yet by the same token I think some of it is jealousy you you once in a while you hear them say things like I wish I had the choice you know I wish I was the one I would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us Uh-huh Yeah Right Uh-huh Right Right Right Uh-huh That's true That's true Yes Right And they enjoy it Yeah And they do enjoy it I I see you're right I see many more men in the supermarket in the parks with their children and I think that is healthy because ch- Right Oh yeah Yes Yeah  Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Oh boy Yeah Well well that that's true There is that part too and I guess we also have to examine though and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as you know anybody else um I guess ha- Oh oh yeah And and you have to I guess you have to question too why a lot of the men especially I think middle age and older men why they feel that way and and I think it gets scary for them to see change also They've been used to being really to be honest in in society and in a way number one and they come home and everything's done for them And their meal is served and I think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching And I think I think this reaction comes more out of fear Now my husband is um he's ten years older than me and but he has his attitudes are very much pro-women pro-career which is kind of interesting He comes from a culture where women are stay at home and do everything um and yet um he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility um if that meant {door} you know for me to be able to uh uh advance or go back to work or whatever I'm kind of more {talking to someone in background} thank you {resumes talking to speaker A} I'm kind of more middle of the road I think that when children are small I think it's okay for women to work especially there should be some a lot more part time but I think it's um I don't believe in this career you know this career drive when when they're small because I think {talking to someone in background} they're downstairs Aaron {resumes talking to A} I think that's very um unfair to to children like uh engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week I refused to work more than thirty I was part-time and even that was a rat race but I think you have to put in perspective that you know when the kids came home from school I wanted to be here I didn't want I don't want a job where I'm traveling around and an- I'm away and uh so I think you can have both It's more hectic but I think you have to put into perspective what your kids need first then
