Hello Hi my name is Dolphene I live in Texas Okay I work for T I do you also Okay okay you ready to begin okay Okay Yes Well I don't think that any of my relatives would really like to go there I believe if I am in a position like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that I will be able to just bring her into my home and my father also or have someone go into their home you know and look them That way Uh-huh Right it's more how they feel about it And it is like they feel the way my mother would put it like somebody had thrown them away You know Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh And another thing to think about on the positive side of the nursing homes here I use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home and I got to see a lot of the things that they did they had a lot of crafts and they had a lot of games and they get together and they do all sorts of things and then there some of the people that are in there are you know very nice and friendly to everybody and then there are others that are it is just a job and they just you know want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important Right Right Yeah Yeah Well it is like the one that I worked in you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day they would just roll themselves around all over the place and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities and then you would see some of the others that were like distant from the other group and they they just didn't like participate together with the others because they had some I guess slight mental disabilities and things like that what do you call Alzheimer <> disease and stuff like that and they weren't really together with the rest of them when they got together for such activities
