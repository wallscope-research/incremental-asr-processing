Okay I'm back on you say you watch evenings mostly Uh-huh so Do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there Which ones Oh two they're going to change Well one they're taking off I don't know what's going to ha- yeah we like L A LAW We don't watch THIRTY SOMETHING but that's kind of young for us My husband and I are grandparents So we don't watch that type of show but we like L A LAW We like that We're just I'm sorry they're breaking the team up because we liked all the ones that were on there I'm not sure I like the new ones too much I just wonder if they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show since it's gone on for so long it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show Of course I guess that's not bad Alan Alda did it on MASH It hasn't hurt him at all So do you mostly like like a story type of thing that lasts an hour In one hour like QUANTUM LEAP That's one of our favorites Right which they do at the beginning of the season to grab your attention You know that's always a bummer too Sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one we do that sometimes I guess I'm not into real heavy stuff L A LAW is about the heaviest thing I watch mostly I'm into it for relaxation so I like things like GOLDEN GIRLS or CHEERS or Monday night is real good with me you know MAJOR DAD and NORTHERN EXPOSURE and what's that one with Burt Reynolds That type of show is what we watch We generally just stay on one channel for all of Monday night just to watch those Just some of the times they're continued but mostly they're just little vignettes A new one we found we really like is that DINOSAURS Have you seen that it's really funny They use like animated it's not like a cartoon but it's like dummies and things that are used and it's really and robots probably But there's always a moral to each story Well we watched it the times we've seen it it's been like on Friday night but it's we've only seen it a couple of times But it's real the first one we saw it involved a tradition of when a person reaches seventy-five and I can't remember what day they call it but the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff Anyway it goes on you know and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all and then when it comes time for him to throw her over well the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her And she said no you can't do you know he was running in a wheelchair to hide her and she said "You can't do that" "This is tradition This is what old people are supposed to be thrown over the cliff" And he said "I don't understand" it's real funny that they give the teenagers as the one that questions what's going on And in the end the son-in-law when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says "No you can't do it" and then "Oh well we've got to do it It's tradition" and the son was you know "Why" And so in the end he doesn't throw her over and of course the town thinks he's just terrible because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it And then we saw one when a teenage boy comes into his manhood they call it the night of the howling or something like that and they all go out and howl you know and the son refused to do it he did he thought it was not No he wouldn't go howl so all the people that worked with the father ostracized him It is it's real interesting to watch the show and the relationship between the family is really now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them So it's our oldest grandson is the one that got us to watching it But it moves real fast It's real short and there's always like I say a moral to it and Well half hour that's all there is to it and they Yeah they're trying to liken the father in there of the teenage son to like JACKIE GLEASON SHOW the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth and I guess maybe there are some parts of that but I didn't really see that in there But what I've read about it they talk about that But anyway we've enjoyed that and I guess mostly I like the news shows too the news magazines like SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY TWENTY or PRIME TIME LIVE or something like that you know all of those shows if I can do it but my husband likes to watch old movies especially war movies or sports which I'm not No I don't Well I like ice skating and I like gymnastics and some track and field but I and I'll watch snippets of baseball games and I just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing And no matter what's on I don't ever just sit and watch T V I'm usually either doing dishes or I may be sewing or you know I always have letter writing or I may be working around in the room somehow but I don't ever just sit and that's something that comes from your old age you know Idle hands are the devil's workshop No it's Right Right Right well our yeah if our grandchildren are with us they have to watch that We don't watch it unless they're here <> But they it's and you know the kids will get you started on stuff like AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS We've wound up sending in one That's something I didn't think that we'd ever do Yeah My oldest grandson pulling his tooth he wouldn't let us pull it and it got to the point he was eating a pear here and he bit into it and it was just hanging by a thread and I'd tell him you know it's getting ready to fall out and he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he wouldn't let anybody pull it And he wound up pull
