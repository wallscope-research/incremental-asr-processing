Okay There is well I am a school teacher And us there is girl that went through our school district I teach in Highland Park who does aerobics at the Y W C A <> turn that off please I am recording <> My husband just turned on something noisy Any way she comes to the school and there are a group of teachers and we exercise regularly for an hour and we do it twice a week And we do aerobics for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes and then we do stretching and toning and cool down for another thirty minutes So it is an hour And then my husband and I take ten mile walks as often as possible And not on the nights that I do aerobics but if he wants to he jogs but we take the fast walks and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house And so we take it seriously We enjoy doing it I enjoy my group at school It is a lot more fun to exercise with somebody than is is to do it by yourself  Uh-huh I understand that I have never been able to do it before Well and too I just make myself I get up at five thirty and I am at school at seven thirty School is not over until four and our class but it is in the building that is the big difference because there are other people around that you had better hurry Go get dressed You know there is motivation around there and then we can change right there in the building I don't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere And I just go and we exercise And until then you know I have belonged to exercise clubs and I have gone to like these gyms you know like in Plano and Richardson rec centers really where they offer aerobics and I have done that before but it has always had to be late at night after I have got home and after dinner and you are just kind of going Ugh And I have tried it immediately after school like try to get some place and exercise from five to six but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late It is It is really hard with our life style when you work to Uh-huh I have twenty-five minutes for lunch That is out for me No I don't think so and they are nice because if we are running late it usually if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late they kind of wait on us You know cause they know we are in the building and coming Where as at another place you are paying a lot more money and it does going to start whether you are there or not So this has worked out real nicely In fact she charges us two dollars a session Huh-uh So it's we like pay her for six weeks at a time cause that is like a unit in school report card period and so it is like twenty-four dollars every six weeks Huh-uh You are not kidding I know We belonged for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership and at first we used it and then it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth And they offered lots of things but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to So we decided to forget that That was just a waste of our our money no Uh-huh It does make you feel better The hard thing is getting going And if you have somebody who will do it with you like for a long time my husband didn't want to walk cause he wants to jog but he decided that maybe you know
