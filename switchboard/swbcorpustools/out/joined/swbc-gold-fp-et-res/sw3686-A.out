Say you did starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one Yeah She had to label everything What was she driving Uh-huh Yeah Yeah quad not really easy to get rebuilt just right and like what were you replacing the starters and bendix on Yeah Did you replace just the bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter Yeah The starters are kind of fragile Especially if you need a tune-up Yeah well if they start real easy you know you just hit the key and it starts up and when it's properly tuned up that starter will last for a long time See they built that starter so it would fit every V eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirty-five years They all take the exact same starter They'll interchange completely I mean completely One starter will fit all of them So they've got a whole lot of torque but to do that they did it use an underdrive system but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast so it's got to spin for very long it's kind of tough on the bushings Usually what goes is the bushings You take a little time replace the bushings you still got a perfectly good starter But most places don't rebuild them with good enough bushings So it's you know after you get rebuilt one you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly especially if you need a tune-up Anyway what are you driving now That's good It was a late model is that Chrysler van Yeah one of the little mini vans Do you like the way it rides and stuff Rides rough Yeah Yeah Yeah right now without getting some of the sportier models the four cylinders aren't real peppy But they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years too yeah I've driven one im- I drove a Volkswagen Beetle for a while about a month in a month I think I put three oil coolers on it every time I turned around I was having trouble with it Everything else I ever owned was American built mostly older cars I've been a mechanic well I starting working my father's service station when I was about twelve So I've been around cars a lot but driven a lot of old Pontiacs My first three cars were seventy model Pontiacs A G T O and a Bonneville and a station wagon I had a couple of Chryslers Had a super B for a while with a four forty in it It was a lot of fun But I don't know gas mileage wasn't too bad It got about seventeen Well till you got crazy with it You know you get the four barrel all worked up and suddenly  it drops off fast but long as you didn't spin the tires too much or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it it didn't do too bad on gas Didn't have to work too hard to move the car around yeah yeah definitely Yeah the my last G M car was a seventy Chevy station wagon and it still had the points and condenser in it When I rebuilt the engine on that about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car I pulled that old points distributor out and got an H E I electronic distributor put into it
