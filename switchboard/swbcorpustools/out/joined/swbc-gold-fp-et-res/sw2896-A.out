What kind of painting are you planning to do Uh-huh Uh-huh what would be interesting Uh-huh Yeah I've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments but <> they look very interesting and you get some beautiful effects with them Yes yeah I've seen that done where there's I saw one that was kind on an ecru undercoat and then it had a little bit darker sort of peachy color and in between there was a sort of a rust put on very sparingly And it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco Uh-huh yeah that should be nice Uh-huh Well Yeah I was about to say you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing Because you might find that it's beyond what you're willing to put into it Although I think it could turn out really nice I haven't ever done fancy painting but I sure did my share of just regular painting I've painted several houses inside No- I never painted the outside Well we used a latex wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork and my job was mostly the woodwork My husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers and I got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine trim work where I'd use a small brush and try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that Uh-huh Well I was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it I have heard that they've got these steamers you can rent now which make it much easier to get wallpaper off I tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago with a just a scraper and wet sponge and it took forever I would not recommend that method if you can rent a steamer if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble If it's really old you don't know what it's put on with Yeah Uh-huh Could be yeah if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too If it's paper it will probably shred uh-huh Well the wallpaper that I was trying to remove was black this was in a bathroom too And the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white and the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background and then it had vivid almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise and lime green and silver and a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that it was awful it was absolutely hideous and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it and a guest went in there and he said it's a good thing I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had something to drink and went in there I would think I was having hallucinations <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale Sure Yeah Well it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time Because if you use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it and it can be done a whole lot faster And with rollers and modern latex paints you can wash up easily because they're water soluble And they dry fast so you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend If you have some help And then if you discover the little tricks and tips about you know how you get through corners and how you do trim and how long to leave the masking tape down because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when you pull it up Well not if you leave it on for weeks it will do that If you take it up the next day it should be fine You want it to get dry but not just real hard You don't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried to hard That's the problem It will come up a lot easier if you don't wait too long And I was told I always used the nice wide masking tape but I've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth Because it rips as you pull it off for one thing and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape And the whole point of using it is to save yourself work You can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape But use good stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands that will go down and come up easily Well I wish you very good luck with it and I will tell you that I have retired from the painting business The last time I had something done was my kitchen cabinets and I decided that was too much to tackle I'd hire a professional Well if I were closer I might well I hope your project turns out great and I really think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting I think that could give it a Well of course that's the other advantage of paint If you don't like it all you do is put on another coat I guess we'd better go because our time looks like it's about up Okay bye-bye Thank you
