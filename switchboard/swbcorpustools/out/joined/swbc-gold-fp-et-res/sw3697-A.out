Okay now then you heard the question what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs Okay  Well Is that the reason you're not doing it or are you so busy you don't have time to do it  Okay Well being a female and being alone I don't do anything but put gasoline in my car and let someone else check the oil even But have you had any major repairs recently Oh Okay Well you should feel very fortunate I had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile and I'll declare that's an expensive Yes uh-huh Maybe I should have just traded the car in it just well I have a very comfortable car and I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car So anyway I have a new transmission and I'm sure that any of them would have charged me almost the same amount But it hurts real bad No I took it to an independent out in Garland I had these people were recommended by a neighbor and you know that's the only thing I am not a native of Dallas So that means I have to depend on trustworthy friends and that's Anyway it's fixed it's running and I pray that I get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it Uh-huh I know it It certainly is frightening What work are you in Oh Okay okay No No I have just retired from the Southwest Medical Center Yeah where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car but they're all too busy So I have to do it the other way and that's find someone and pay them to do it So I certainly hope you have a nice New Year it could be but I don't much think so well we're starting out a new one so let's make it a good one Okay Thank you Bye Bye-bye
