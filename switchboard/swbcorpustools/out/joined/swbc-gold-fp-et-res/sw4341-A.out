Okay looks like we're ready to go Capital punishment the problem I have with capital punishment is that it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime but I don't think that it really actually does that I don't think it deters anybody because most of the time crimes are committed without any thought to the consequences and they don't stop and think and say well maybe I shouldn't do this because I might get the gas chamber or something like that They worry about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it And how about you Uh-huh I do too yep Uh-huh yeah you still have to do it I Uh-huh So you're in favor of capital punishment then Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Needs to be punished or eliminated from society Right And then do it all over again Uh-huh Right Have to agree with you and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because you still see them committing the same crimes but I tend to agree with you that we should have it I don't know that it's always effective but I guess we're kind of stuck with it it's a difficult problem isn't it to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime Uh-huh Uh-huh Right uh-huh Uh-huh Do you think they should be punished at all or like go to prison because they're not really a danger to society It was almost really self defense isn't it in a case like that Uh-huh I know they put them in jail sometimes I guess Uh-huh Uh-huh Um Uh-huh You know now I wonder what you think about this and unfortunately we don't get to do it but it used to be a long time ago I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment So if somebody killed somebody in your family then if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to execute that person And I know that if somebody had done something to my family I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them but I don't think that's done much anywhere That's kind of drastic punishment Right Might make you feel better but Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Right because they're a danger to everybody else that's interesting I have to agree with that There's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that aren't really a danger to society and Right Right probably more of them then the other way around Interesting not sure I'm in Washington D C or at least very close to it I'm not sure what kind of capital punishment we have here Uh-huh
