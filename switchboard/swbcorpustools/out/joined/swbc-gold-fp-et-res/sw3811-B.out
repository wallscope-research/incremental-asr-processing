Yeah we Two year old daughter in child care + and we went through the process of searching for child care and finding what we consider to be real good child care at a pretty reasonable price we think How about you do you have any children boy Yeah Are you Where are a student No kidding I was a professor in a university here in California for a while Yeah are you going to put your son in child care in a year or two Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Well that's a good experience I think and there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good and they kind of boil down to any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative and what we found to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were going to be loving and that's more important than anything else We could have sent her to a fancier facility she goes to a home This is a couple emigrated from China early in their lives They've been here probably thirty forty years They've got three daughters and they have a loving home and they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon And our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends so it's a good experience I th- if it's good I think it's very good for the child And if it's a loving environment I think it's very good and and that's really what we've learned about it She'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year but we feel real fortunate and we were able to just choose in the marketplace I don't know what it's like around Hattiesburg Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I'll bet they're involved Yeah Yeah Well that's I know it's a real hard thing to do even for people in university communities Out here at Manford they have a real good facility and there is quite a waiting list to get into that So it's an important decision it's an industry that's still a cottage industry and I think this Well it is the best way to do it interestingly I think that my own interest in human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn Because I think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market As a matter of fact my future is banked on that professionally because I believe that there are pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care Primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life it's phenomenal It's phenomenal the human operating system
