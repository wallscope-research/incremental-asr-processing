books Mainly I read the Bible these days Good that's great to hear and Christian literature I've kind of I used to read a lot of novels but it seems as though if you really want to set side time to read the Bible and you work and whatever that pretty well takes up your time for reading And I been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible in my heart and he really has It's getting to where a just really want to read it Do you Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Have you ever read any of Frank E Peretti's THIS PRESENT DARKNESS and I forget the the other well he's also written a lot of children how old is your daughter Five okay he's written some children's books as well and they're all spiritually oriented yeah Frank E Peretti P E R E T T I Uh-huh Yeah do because I love to read his children's books just Yeah they're good they're great And it's like usually about a family of archaeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into like digging in old ruins and running across like the old gods and things Yeah it is It's real exciting And it also teaches them spiritual warfare you know so Uh-huh Well it's hard for me Uh-huh I know it and especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats Uh-huh that's right Uh-huh yeah I've read a lot of his too Yeah Can't put them down Uh-huh yeah there's another guy what can what is his name durn you would well you know when you're recording you can't remem- Dean Kratz or Kranz or Y- who no it's a guy And he writes the same thing though It's that real gruesome horror stories Yeah Koontz his last name ends in a Z I know that Yeah Uh-huh I kind of got burnt out on Steven King though It seems like it's all the did you ever read the it's one of his first books THE STAND I know it And that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that You know that Uh-huh I love that book though I thought it was great yes those hedges when they started moving Whenever they made that into a movie I was thinking my gosh if they show that I'll just die For some reason that scared me more than anything Yeah Uh-huh And that was a pretty scary movie too Yeah Uh-huh That's right Yeah that's true I liked IT as well That's another big fat one Yeah except it broke my heart I'm a dog lover No it was What yeah I've read that one too He's written a lot of books Boy he just sits down eight hours a day Just like any other job That's right That one about the Gypsies or that hunger or s- Yeah Richard Bachman Yeah he's so prolific I know it And I have gone back and after I graduated I read some of the old classics that I just bluffed my way through and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit too Once you can get into the language you know the l- like it's English but it's not the same English they speak today So it's kind of hard to keep you know at it but their worthwhile Literature Yeah me too Uh-huh Nathaniel Hawthorne is pretty scary himself wasn't that Jane Ehre spelling--Eyre No he wrote JANE EHRE too spelling Eyre Yeah Yeah uh-huh Right right That's why I like to watch that MASTERPIECE THEATRE on channel thirteen because they'll take a classic and televise it you know put it into a viewing format more or less Uh-huh Do you Well I can imagine Yeah yeah me too Well I think we've accomplished five minutes so It's good talking to you Bye-bye
