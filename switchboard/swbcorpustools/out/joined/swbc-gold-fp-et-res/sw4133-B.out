Right I think I've seen some statistics that say that it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life Right Well that's committing them mostly is you know either crimes of passion or at the moment or they think they're not going to get caught or Yeah  Yeah but you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like Jeffrey Dahlmer do you want by putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again Whereas if you kill him there is not that possibility Yeah I don't think he could ever redeem himself but in some cases yes Yeah it's yeah once you've made a decision that way it's a little difficult to go back on it yeah yeah it's a- the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is based on the person who is accused Right Yeah and they seem that the profit margin's so high that yeah the risk is almost not there Yeah Yeah Yeah well it's also I used to live in Georgia and you know the big thing down there was all right we have capital punishment but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed it's very racially related and ethnically related Right Right Right and that and you know also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility though we don't currently do this of making restitution you will work your prison job and any money you earn will go to the victim's family Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah well I think on some of it you have to say someone's responsible for his actions Well I never liked the insanity defense
