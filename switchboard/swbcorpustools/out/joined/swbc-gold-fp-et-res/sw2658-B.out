Uh-huh Well I'm having a problem right now with a computer that we've just returned So for me it's actually a pretty good topic Yeah well we could talk about that and then we could talk a bit about just quality of products in general if they're better or worse like if they last longer or something like that Oh I can imagine Well see I don't You can't read labels and you can't Good There you go Okay Yeah Right Well we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project and we called up the company and asked them details on it We bought not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper And we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with and they were very happy with the system and they felt they've gotten a good price And we went in we explained what we needed and yes we had to go across the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey to meet these people And so we went there we told them about the stuff and the guy said that the computer would fit our needs And we these things won't make any sense to you probably but he told us we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer And it's called a user boards or slots is what it's called And he told us there's four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user and we can put full size cards in there And so we said great you know we'll buy it and we put in our order And a week later we went back and picked up the computer And then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it and there's only one slot we could put it in And at this point we only have one board so it wasn't so bad so we used it a bit but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in And Well it has them but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need to put in it in it And even though they told us in advance that you could they told us there would be no problem because you know the salesman just doesn't really know Right That's completely it The salesman didn't know So we went back in and we struck an agreement with the people who said change the casing it comes in so that we could put in extra boards Okay So they did that And we said are you sure this will work we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesn't really work anyway and et cetera and they were doing it at their own costs so we said fine And we went back and we talked to the person a second time and things like that and then we get the computer home my husband goes to pick it up last week and we couldn't go get it sooner because I just had the baby and you know life's just a little bit complicated And he goes and gets it brings it home first of all they're missing components of it like cables so you can't really test it out And then second thing we still can't put the boards in because they have other things blocking where we need to do it And see now we're dealing with having to bring it back again and they say they can you know do something different and change some connectors and we hope so but it's a hassle you know it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on Right So well actually some things are pretty good with that because I put it on a gold credit card and I just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation and they said well you don't have to pay for it yet Yes Yeah Right and so you know Well because these guys if they give us a hard time we're going to say you look you know if you can't fix this to our satisfaction we're just returning the computer And if we do that I just tell the credit card company don't pay the charge even though they've already paid it But they'll just you know undo the credit that they did to them Yeah Right And Uh-huh Uh-huh no Uh-huh Uh-huh What brand is it Do you know But I was wondering like you know in our case where we knew we were buying a copy we weren't buying on I B M P C and I was wondering if you Uh-huh Do you buy it at some major store Highlands chain down there that I don't know up here Nope Uh-huh I think a lot of things are not made as well wel- of course it's hard to think of an exact example but I jus- yeah well I like electronic stuff you know for one thing I know their work you know cars I think are not made as well as they could be  because I they want people to replace it after a couple of years Uh-huh Yeah I had a Toyota and I loved it My Toyota did really well Good Yeah Well I think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship The people just don't care about what they're doing You know the whole nobody cares nobody's really paying Right give me my paycheck so I can go home Yeah Yeah and also I think well I do research and so I'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever work gets done and you get satisfaction out of it But you know I think things come both from the individual side and also from the company side because the companies that give the attitude that well you know you're the last one hired so you'll be the first one fired and we just want you to do your days work and we don't really care about you as an individual When you've got that type of attitude on it the people don't care about their work And so Little value just in whatever you do Doing a good job of it
