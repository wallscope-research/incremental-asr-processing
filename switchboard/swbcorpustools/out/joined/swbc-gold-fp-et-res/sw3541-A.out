Okay You think you're getting your money's worth Well that's probably the next year's agenda yeah They're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around and I think one way or the other we're going to pay for the bureaucracy I guess it's one area that is really I think hurting the economy more than anything I think the taxes every time you turn around they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products and I think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now That's right That's right Yep that's right Well I think that the problem with the sales tax of course is it's an unfair tax across the board as far as ability to pay which allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards But now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of you know taxes on everything they buy and where people that make you know two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they aren't going to be paying taxes on you know And that's the unfair inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue but I don't think it is anymore not in Texas anyway That's right that's right That's right that's right And that's the unfairness of the thing but I think taxes generally are unfair so Well you know like other things if they don't affect you you don't worry about them too much I have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still so it doesn't I think you know generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is you know And I guess if people got thirty forty thousand bucks to spend on a car that's their prerogative you know I don't have a whole of sympathy on that maybe you buy that you know and I don't mean to be knocking Yeah there are there are And the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that I guess you know unless they really want it buy something that you know more well it's just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids you know It's a way of increasing the population that was one of the initial ideas of you know giving exemptions on kids on federal taxes And where you exempt things like one of the best things I heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably Lloyd Bentsen said that all you know if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be you know spending more money using their credit cards Now I don't know if that's true or not but if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and you know any kind of interest that you're paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers So that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go you know tax things that they don't you know to a degree well like booze you know example they keep raising the taxes on booze it gets to the point you know it makes drunks sober you know They quit buying it
