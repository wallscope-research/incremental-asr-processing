I think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the Middle East I agree Absolutely I think that's great I'm glad to see that but again I don't want to see us pour well a whole lot under any circumstances because I don't know I'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them and so I'm not much in favor of it but I'm glad to see us advising them that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money But I'm ready to have a President elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda even if it doesn't work at least he is somebody who is working on that problem And I haven't seen that in the last eleven years so they don't seem to have a clue I agree once we started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the world bank as far as aid is concerned and I think there's a limit and we passed it a long time ago Yeah That's another thing I don't understand is things like selling technology and even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt to me that just doesn't make any sense as much in debt as we are I don't know I think it's definitely time for a change but I don't see anybody I don't understand too why we have to have Democrats and Republicans and it's either one way or the other it seems to be we're turning into a black and white society you either do it this way or you do it that way and there's no in between and it obviously isn't working yeah I agree with you Well of course you know we have the national embarrassment in our state Jessie Helms and as soon as we can get of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he just lines up people against him so it's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions He's usually on the ninety-eight to two side he's the one of the two that votes Yeah he's very ineffective I think Right unfortunately nineteen ninety Yeah we're stuck with him for a little while longer but unfortunately for him but maybe fortunately for us his health is not great so I hate
