Well if you're from Iowa you must be very artsy crafty Everyone I've ever known from the Midwest can do everything with their hands I didn't know anyone ever moved from California to Iowa I'm teasing only because I'm from Indiana I like the Midwest But I married a Texan and they have a way of dragging you back home Anyway we're supposed to be talking about crafts do you have any hobbies that you do things with your hands like knitting or you do a lot then Do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching actually I'm pretty untalented I used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting but I don't know somehow I don't have the time anymore But I have all these friends that wherever you go they sit down and the next thing you know they pull out of their bags their most recent needle craft and in December everyone was doing stockings you know these gorgeous detailed minute tiny stitch stockings Yes Is this your first baby Have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets Did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself or how did you make a quilt Uh-huh But you actually hand quilted it yourself did you need a loom or were you a- was it small enough that you could just hold it Uh-huh But again my mother back in Indiana we had a quilting frame in our basement and she would quilt whole quilts by herself yes which I was always amazed I have one of them but you know to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that it's a tremendous amount of work you think children you can use crafts to make wonderful things for children I think when babies I think afghans and the crocheted little sweaters are wonderful and they'll wear them Once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear them yes I think it's very clever It's funny that you said For Christmas my daughter and I received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for us A beautiful Christmas design and they were matching and they were lovely but when I washed them although I took the precaution of turning them inside out I really didn't do anything else And truly everything fell off or most of it So I went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back and I bought the paint and redid most of the edges and it was salvageable and I but it's so I'm familiar with that but I think you're very clever to sew around the edges I think gluing alone certainly if you wash it any amount of time it tends to kind of come loose at the edges
