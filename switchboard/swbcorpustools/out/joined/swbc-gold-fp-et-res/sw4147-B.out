Yes we do have a pet We have a dog that we got from the well we call it the S P C A It's from an animal shelter he'd come in there as a stray he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross well he was very well trained when we got him he's No we suspect that he you know got away from somebody traveling through and hurt in an accident because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him And if they were local people they would have been able to find him Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh I think so Uh-huh <> Yeah Well I guess in one sense we felt that it's nice to have a dog even though there are you know complications come with it And then with our children at the time they were grade five and grade eight so it was an age where we thought it be good for them to have the discipline that goes with having a pet  Yeah right So Well that's the idea I think the reality of it is that they perhaps it depends on everyone's discipline And from that aspect I'm short on the discipline because I don't enforce that the kids look after the dog and we've had him about four years now but I think it you know it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly Yeah  Actually no we live in an area that's probably about two and a half miles from the university might say we live right in the middle of a residential area so that is not as good you know this dog being a small dog it's more more acceptable but again Yeah Uh-huh Yeah that's one of the biggest concerns It's like there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal but the same time one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal and the larger they are the more room they need to exercise Right Well Uh-huh
