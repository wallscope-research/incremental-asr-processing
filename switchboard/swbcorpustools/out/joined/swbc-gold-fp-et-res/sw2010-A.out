This is Archie Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES Have you ever lived in that part of the country Have you ever visited it I think it was the black hills of South Dakota Well I lived in Omaha for five winters and that rolling kind of Yeah is fairly famili- The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics apparently it's going to win everything and I had been told you know you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of Well the interesting thing is I had heard that and I tend to I think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great and the thing is it was a good story and I guess that's what I really like Although I must admit I did look at my watch after about an hour Yeah No I've heard that's really great though No You must really keep up Well SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY isn't that a is it a terror movie or is it just suspenseful do you listen to Gary Cogill Is do you know who he is He's the movie critic you've okay He's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas And he has a talk show on the K L I F Anyway it's on from seven to nine or something and people call in and if you keep up with movies it's kind of interesting There's a certain a mount of dribble that they do they've got a couple of kids ten or twelve years old and they call in and they review movies But it's anyway he it's interesting You listen to him and then you go watch the movie In fact people had just seen I was listening Sunday night a little bit when I was going to pick up my daughter But anyway it was the it's interesting though the difficulty with DANCING WITH WOLVES is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it the question is did he really know it was going to be good two utts or did he just do it Do you know who the guy was that was playing the wagon driver A little piece of trivia You know the guy when he first headed out from the army post he plays on MURPHY BROWN Yes he's Eldon her housepainter Can you believe that that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that I thought no it's really funny But I thought it you think back and yeah it was him but you know with the beard and all that stuff it's Yeah Real scruffy looking and it was really funny that he winds up playing in the movie But I thought it's good that you know it was a lot of fun I don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we're at about five minutes I should think we've done enough Well I don't know Why do we end this thing I think it just says hang up Why don't we do that Good-bye Sharon
