Okay what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful Well I guess so ha- well how old are you Okay so you have been to some family reunions perhaps Now how long in advance do they let them know Uh-huh So they all know it Uh-huh uh-huh Yes Well that sounds like fun do they all have the small children too that come So all ages Well my husband on one side has an extended family and they don't ever plan it like you do I think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind so they have to start talking about it or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody because they're rather socially active too And so it seems by doing it about six months ahead they can pretty much get everybody there If they don't you know they'll say we're planning to go to a certain place that weekend with somebody else and we're already locked in but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them my parents are the youngest of very large families Therefore they don't have many people left And the few previous ones I've had I haven't known many of those people but in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family and that's been very nice with I have one sister and three brothers and they're only three out of five of us who have children So we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other And that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large and they don't see each other very often we don't really know many of them It really is they're fun they're a lot of fun but still they're not done on a regular basis and you kind of forget what happened and who they were from the time before those are the ones that are in Texas Or you go to Indiana on that Uh-huh where in Indiana Lafayette I don't know where I used to live in Indianapolis Yeah yeah it's very pretty country in there I think it's gorgeous Well I when is your next one scheduled now Yes well and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you Maybe you need another milestone you know Yes well I'm sure and then all of your family probably has not met your husband is he and your both living in Sherman Do you work to T I Uh-huh and does he Uh-huh well we don't either but I have a friend who is working on this project Yes and Well I don't know I have a hard time getting people on the telephone Uh-huh getting through to anybody Sometimes I call off and on all day but anyway I guess we're supposed to be talking about family reunions aren't we But I got off that Yes well I think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes And we both look forward to going to our next reunions I'm sure But it has been fun talking to you Thank you Okay good Bye-bye
