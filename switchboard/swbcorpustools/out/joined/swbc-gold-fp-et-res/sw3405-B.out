Okay Lowell so I'd like to know what do you do in lawn and garden what's of interest to you and how do you go about it you do actually grow a garden to produce food Uh-huh So how much room do you have Uh-huh that's what I was curious about I was wondering whether you had actually some of the flowers that you had planted were bulb type that you would dig up and then put down your garden and then put them back in later or something like that So you Uh-huh you do have a separate area Oh Uh-huh Well tell me this Lowell do you enjoy doing that kind of work and do you have the time to relax so that you can take advantage of it Uh-huh Well I'm a little more fortunate I think from that point of view I'm not allergic to things and I moved here in State College quite a while ago and was fortunate to get some land So actually I have nine acres And for many years I grew sweet corn and my kids were there and so we set up a shop there and I would collect the corn very carefully ear by ear and it was never more than one to two hours old and people came from miles and miles around to get that corn because they knew it was individually picked and very very fresh So we had a nice thing going there and it was delicious I really enjoyed that and then I also have a garden it's probably twenty-five by thirty or forty something like that that I put in my normal food garden things each year and I have a whole lot of everything in the actually I love broccoli brussels sprouts and I have all kinds of tomatoes kale and all those good things and I rent out my field that I used to plant in sweet corn to a local farmer and then he plants about a quarter of an acre of sweet corn for me to use so I get out of that amount of work at any rate it is very very nice I really enjoy it My problem is not having enough time to do the job as completely and as thoroughly as I would like I enjoy it very much Yes it does and actually I had a pony there for twenty-five years and he had two acres that he had for his own grazing So he had his own backyard garden too But that worked out very nicely too I built him a barn back there in the part of my corn field and he lived in that but as far as gardening is concerned we do enjoy it My wife is in charge of the flowers She does all of the flower gardening throughout the whole property and we have you know an acre and a half that the house is sitting in the middle of and she has flower gardens and bulbs perennials and things We have blueberries blackberries I have two or three apple trees the Golden Delicious were fantastic this year My neighbor has pear trees and blueberries all kinds of food around there if we just had time to take advantage of it My wife has spent probably I don't know how many hours in the last two or three weeks canning pears because there were so many of them and I have been totally engulfed with Golden Delicious apples I just couldn't handle the amount of them we got this year It's really been a remarkable year I use my Golden Delicious and they make delicious pies
