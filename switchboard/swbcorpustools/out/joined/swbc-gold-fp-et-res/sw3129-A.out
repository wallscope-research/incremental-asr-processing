Well Tom just tonight I was working on my car out of necessity and I had uh uh had a long age-old problem of my bright lights not working uh this is the type of uh switch where you flip the the lever the turn signal on the column and when I would uh put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely which is even worse than them just not getting bright And I had presumed that it was the switch and uh this is uh an older car it's a seventy-two M G so I had to mail order the part uh which I had done and tonight I went out and uh at least hooked in the new part only to discover that that apparently is not the problem it's not in the switch because it does the same thing with the new switch So I'll be faced with having to return that product and uh hoping that uh you know that they will accept it although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used Uh I had done what diagnosis I could primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that I did have of the car and uh pretty much decided that that had to be the problem I talked to one mechanic about it and he suspected the switch also Uh but I've not you know I really don't know what the problem might be It it the other switch could be the main switch itself uh that turns the lights on or off which is on the dashboard uh it might be tied into the equation somehow but I I don't know I should look at that I don't remember seeing one in the uh in the diagram so I'll have to go back and look at that Uh-huh Yeah that's a good idea What I've typically found when that uh companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all and I hope that that's the case this time Right exactly it's out of Kansas somewhere No it's not I also got a piece of chrome for the the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car but it is not either it's obviously doesn't quite fit so it must be for a different year so I'll have to try to return that as well Well I had one person that I used for years and years on this car because I've owned this car since it was new and uh but it's over like in the Brook Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and Inwood area and I hadn't used him for some years and the last time I called him back it turned out that he had further specialized instead of uh all import cars he has narrowed it down to where he only works on uh German cars and {pause} German cars I'm not sure that he works on much else at all but he doesn't work on British cars any more and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it So uh uh I may have to check with that person as it turns out that one that shop is near where I now work So I'll uh I should be able to take it in and check that part out I've not had to exchange any other parts recently because they were defective Now I've had had pretty good luck I just however did uh have to get a a uh one of these jam box portable dual cassette players uh repaired I purchased it at Sam's and I had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty and I should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt because I didn't take it in right away and let a whole year go by Uh some of the buttons didn't work right where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play and as it turned out it had a full year's warranty and I could have gotten it repaired for free but I had to take it in while it was in the shop I ended up finding the receipt that I thought had long since been lost uh but it didn't do me any good because I had I had missed the window by about a week or two So I didn't even I didn't really uh even bring it up when I went in to pick it up But uh that's really my only experience in the past year where I've had to take a product back because of a defect Good grief Uh-huh  Huh My goodness Huh
