Okay let me see I've been sitting here awhile I almost forgot the topic But it seems like I get most of my news from television we only get the paper on the weekends and so I'm not much of a paper reader and I'm don't rarely listen to the radio so I get most of my news like from documentaries like FORTY-EIGHT HOURS TWENTY TWENTY you know the news at night News in the afternoon that kind of thing Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Are you in the car quite a bit or Oh Oh Uh-huh I see Yeah I pretty much am and I watch the news at least twice a day So if I've missed something and I've just recently decided to stay home with my children and so it seems as if I catch the news right as it happens you know There was the explosions and that kind of thing My husband will say how did you know about that Yes it happened at such and such time And that's different for me So I usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing no it just seems like since I've recently stayed home that is what's happened you know It's just that now that I've stayed home I'm usually aware of when these things occurred and it happened and Right right Uh-huh <> slash unit plus is this considered non-speech Uh-huh Huh Right Right It kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story That kind of thing So Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I know what you're saying Yeah But I try and catch most of those programs on Wednesday's and Friday's and if I miss them you know I try and tape them if I'm out that kind of thing I try and tape them and so I can sit back and watch them And it's pretty interesting Uh-huh Well yeah Plus I find that I have to video tape quite a bit of things If I don't want any interruptions you know That kind of thing it seems like ten o'clock at night Unfortunately but that's what it seems like ten o'clock at night Uh-huh
