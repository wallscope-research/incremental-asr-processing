Okay Go ahead Oh Sure Uh-huh you're kidding Yeah  Uh-huh Sure that's good because sometimes I wonder you know being a lay person out there not knowing exactly what's going on in space Whether you know they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here Being you know to me all this space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth That we can't live on Mars We can't live here we can't live there this is the place that we have to live there's no other resource for us to look at other than here So it's kind of like to me I would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space and what you know not that I want everything to halt and let's forget about the space program or whatever because we're always curious and we always need to know more things But to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here Let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here Mainly because the space program has taught us that there is no other place for us this is it if we would have went into space and found Mars a livable planet we probably would have inhabited it and you know who would have cared about earth It would have been another planet to kind of take over and continue on you know and that when I look at the space program itself I think of it you know as being in terms of it's interesting to learn but it brings down the fact that this earth is it It's it for us you know what I mean unless technology makes the decision that we are all going to live in space or whatever But I would love to go into the space shuttle some day and just see you know the earth and the different planets and things like that I think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do I don't know Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Exactly Uh-huh Uh-huh Exactly Yeah that's true you know And I think of I'm sure you probably have heard of the Genesis program that's going on currently out in the Arizona desert you know they're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create you know an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it and then they have an area that's more you know full of vegetation tropicals that kind of thing to kind of look at things and say you know environment wise this is where we're living but what effects it and how can we improve it and things like that And I think in space I don't know how many people could live up in space for any length of time just the way that we're affected by when it's cloudy out and it's cloudy for days and we don't see the sun and the people their moods are extreme you know It's like God if I don't get to see the sun I'm going to be in this bad mood all this entire time and this is how I see people reacting You know when is the sun going to come out So I wonder how you know somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun You know in the aspect that we see it and never seeing you know light bright days you know And
