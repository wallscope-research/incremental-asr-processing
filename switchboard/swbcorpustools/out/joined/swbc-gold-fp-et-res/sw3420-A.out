Hello my name is Donna and I'm calling from Plano Texas okay would you like me to go first Okay I have three children two who are in regular school eleven year old an eight year old and then my little one three year old is in a University of Gymnastics it's a preschool and I think it was really hard to pick the right day care or preschool or Mother's Day Out I guess you can classify them all together some of the qualifications that I look for was you know the cost and exactly what they did if it was structured or nonstructured if they had a little academic in there and you know you know what the qualifications of the teachers' were and if the place was clean and the hours and just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff congratulations Right Or staying home Uh-huh That's a very good place to start I think Uh-huh Yeah the Mother's Day Out programs and that's where Shannon had started in a Mother's Day Out program and the churches always have I think a pretty good program and you have to make sure that you apply pretty early because a lot of places have very long waiting lists and another question to ask is if they're state certified you know if the teachers have their Master's degree in child education and child development you know what kind of a structure is it going to be when your child's a little bit older like a three year old you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap Is there like a mandatory nap time What they do at Shannon's school is have a video tape going and they lay on these little mats and if they fall asleep they kind of let them sleep and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones and the other ones get up and go do something else So she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there you know which is nice That's true Right And sometimes when the child's a lot younger before three years old you know like the church is a good program and sometimes you even consider you know having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or something like that and another consideration is what's the ratio of teachers  to + to children because that makes a difference and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day just your child or do they just put any child in any crib you know you would want maybe your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed you know I'm sure that whatever you decide you'll be happy with And it's exciting time to have a new one I bet that's wonderful Uh-huh Asking Right some places take them as infants I guess you know like eight weeks even there's a place to look into a friend of mine who's a nurse was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place on Fifteenth Street up it's in Plano somewhere where nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants and then only up to like two years old and it's supposed to be really a you know some places just specialize in just real little ones and then other ones are the older children But it is a difficult situation I think when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry
