I imagine you can't escape it Well of course it was fun for you To really I was born and raised near Miami and spent the last twenty years in Dallas where the Rangers played And for the last roughly year I've been in San Francisco where there are two teams The Oakland As and the San Francisco Giants but honestly you know I do my duty and watch the sports on the newscasts but that's about all the exposure I have to sports Uh-huh <> yeah sure Well I guess the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland As were like the leading teams a couple of years ago Well I th- well I don't know That's sort of what I gather and I don't know What is the prognosis for this year Good I assume that means good for the Minnesota Yep I think a train went by I know a train went by I don't know what the noise was but I think it probably was the train Well I don't know I don't even know who has been winning as far as the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland As but I think they both won their opener I sort of gathered that in my subliminal memory Huh Uh-huh I guess they are different leagues Is that right The As Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Eighty-six Huh Well they must play every day then I mean eighty-six times two is a hundred sixty And Lord that's over five months worth Even if they play every day that's over five months worth No That was the Super Bowl I don't feel so bad I think you don't know all that much more than I do about baseball I see okay really okay Well I know the Super Bowl
