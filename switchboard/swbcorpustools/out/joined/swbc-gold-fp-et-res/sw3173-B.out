I think I would like something like an economy car that gets really good mileage and one that's really reliable I think probably not a brand new car but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra Or something like that something my husband absolutely air-conditioning and a radio A M F M and a cassette player and what else do I want I would think kind of a subdued color would be nice You know a navy blue or a Yeah that's what it would be for is for him to drive back and forth to work I think that's something we might want too is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic I think we would want one that even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed probably that would be a good idea yeah That's right So if we wanted it to take people out that's a good thought I that hadn't crossed my mind Yes I would go for that Well thank you for calling All right Bye
