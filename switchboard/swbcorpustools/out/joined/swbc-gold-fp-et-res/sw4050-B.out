Hello That's okay I'm Bill from Raleigh another one from a different state besides Texas Right yes and no it wasn't really a planning one but it was a birthday and I brought a lot of family together then It went pretty good I've worked in hotels so I kind of know how to do these things I used to you know Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday and it's all of like she comes from a big family She has like seven sisters I think They show up and all their kids And then all she has I have like let's see she has four sons and two daughters and they show up and all their kids so it's a pretty big reunion it's about two hundred people maybe probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone you know could eat comfortably and everything I guess probably the most helpful thing was that for the rent we rented like a rescue squad building or something like that And everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for like soft drinks and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill And each person in the family you know brought a dish or something It was kind of pot luck You know everybody brought their specialties I guess you would say Yeah And of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook she's eighty-six Now she does she looks probably like she's in her early sixties and if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact yeah My nickname for her is Honey Woman That's what I call her also one thing that's helpful and I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever but all my family lives like in the same county so But it's just kind of like get on the telephone and it's so and such days from such and such date and everybody just shows up I would say you're spread out then my immediate family you know my parents and my brothers and sisters I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever because my dad was in the Army and we're pretty strung out all over But since they've moved back to Carolina's we still are the only ones do not live in Yantsen County I live in Raleigh and then my parents live in Greenville and I have one brother and his wife live in Greenville and another brother that lives outside of Fayetteville So we're spread out but everybody else is centralized in my home town Waynesboro so Nobody moves away except us Yeah I got out as soon as I graduated Just like this town is too small for me Good-bye
