Hi Yeah actually I agree that that's an interesting thing I believe for civil suits it's not unanimous right but for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law Yeah I actually thought I'd read that too and that's why I phrased it that way I wonder yeah the difference could be that for if there is such a thing state felonies versus federal felonies that things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote and things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal don't require but I don't know what the laws do you think that that's an unreasonable requirement that they be unanimous Yeah that would be an interesting change It was also allow the idea that if you had one person who was very disagreeable that it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt criterion that it increases the likelihood of getting the proper judgment So I think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision Yeah actually I thought that that would be very interesting thing to do I would like to do that I've been out here twenty some years and I've been called three different times but I've never actually even made it into the jury box because there have always been a number of people and I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions I yeah I also think that would be really good I Uh-huh Well the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three or some such number that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure going on and that peer pressure and in some cases if it's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons  Uh-huh Yeah I understand you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response I think of the movie TWELVE ANGRY MEN You ever seen that movie <> yeah it's exactly that situation where it's Henry Fonda and it's eleven to one and he's the one I believe he was opposed to the conviction and he held on and
