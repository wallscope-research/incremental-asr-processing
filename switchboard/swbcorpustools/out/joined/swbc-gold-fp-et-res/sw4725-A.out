Regarding taxes I you know taxes are really a necessary evil in a civilized society But really people get upset at taxes because it's more efficient to do things yourself and so as a result you know it's a trade-off you know for the common good you know for the benefit of others you know How much of your resource should you dedicate to making things work for others Have you you know ever thought you know just how much of that money should go to other people that really don't deserve it Well the thing of it is if I wanted to just you know permanently become a book reader I guess I could just you know go on public assistance you know look for people to take care of me And probably a good woman right just con somebody to take care of me And then you don't have to be on the tax roll but taxes are very difficult kind of thing and everybody really hates it It was very timely I always over pay my deductions so I wind up getting money back from my withholding So you know that's always a smile But of course you know I've paid it in and I should calculate it better No I work for the F B I So I'm a federal employee Yeah Guess I don't sound like it Yeah I belong I've got all four feet in the trough you know being a federal employee but I can understand that you know who gets benefits Like every time there is a bond issue you know I vote no on every one of them I but there this is not tax revolt country there's too many most of us have all four feet in the trough you know Plus our snout right up to our ears So you know it's not exactly that kind of a place that you want to you know get into a tax revolt situation But the local taxes here I in this particular area you know I think I pay about thirty-five hundred for taxes on my four bedroom house you know And which is a lot of money and so as people get older and older you know they think about retirement and that sort of thing and they're building old peoples homes you know at tax expense Well I think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper At thirty-three hundred dollars or thirty-five hundred dollars I'm paying in taxes why I could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a house for that right You know instead it's the taxes here so Course I don't know whether I want to go to Bulverde or not you know or Seguin or someplace like that But there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer and I think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer If you're not going to use them then you want to be in environment That's a strategy I think that the people have to take is how to be able to lessen their cost of living You know I'm five or six years before I'm eligible to retire and I'm saying well you know I really can't stay here as a retiree It's too expensive I'm going to have go out you know in you know East Fork someplace and do my thing you know Right they redecorated in nineteen seventy-five you know And they're not doing it again you know So Well it's certainly you must be a T I employee You must be a T I employee You're not a T I who do you work for you're
