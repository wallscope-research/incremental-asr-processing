Yes I do I like to play basketball and weight lifting Those are probably the two main things I like to do Yeah in the winter typically it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis I like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall but in the winter it gets pretty cold yeah so it's mostly indoor sports I think in the winter how about yourself Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Do you do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise Uh-huh  Yes it's similar to aerobics with weights but it's like low impact aerobics just with weights Okay are you familiar with step or bench aerobics yes I have in Atlanta that's most of the health clubs are all that's the in thing At first it was just regular aerobics but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over they call it a low impact aerobics and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time And from when I've done it it does give you a real good workout But only thing I'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees you know and movement of going up on the step you know that could create a problem they seem to think that it won't but you never know Yeah I think my ankles probably are my main weak point But I've kind of taken care of that I wear high tops and then also a support ankle brace which is very stiff and wearing that I haven't had any problems in the past year or so Yeah Yeah I Uh-huh Yeah I injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy it would only take three or four days and I could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself to play that way so how successful is your exercise video Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh So it's a good workout Uh-huh So in the winter I guess there's a lot of it's quite cold and snow
