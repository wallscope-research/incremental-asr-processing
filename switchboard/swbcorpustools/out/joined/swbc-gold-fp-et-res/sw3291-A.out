Okay we're being recorded number one I am one hundred percent for total gun control I Yes I am not a member of the National Rifle Association and I don't believe in hunting and I just have had my fill of what is going on with the crime rate and I really feel that we have to do something in order to Uh-huh No there's only one problem I have with the whole thing though is you know when they do it I think our biggest problem is yes the crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available I think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available And the types of the weapons there is no Right There is no reason for it And you know when people say you know well my God they're cutting into my civil liberties and all this no I take a different stand that as long as they are available and they are so readily accessed out there then something is taken away from my civil liberties separated into an additional slash unit before {D no} And maybe I'm a little bit strong when I said total gun control that's really not what I meant But we need control We've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the public Uh-huh  Uh-huh Yes All right you sound like you're into the technology of it which is yeah I agree you know and again my entire family they are all hunters and you know they don't appreciate my stand and I really have no problem with sports hunters I really don't It's just when they come out and they say they need an Uzi in order to do some accurate or decent deer hunting I think that's totally outrageous What's happening is people are losing they seem to be losing their common sense over the issue And the issue is becoming the focus and not what is actually happening with guns I think something will happen
