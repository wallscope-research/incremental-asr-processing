Why don't you go ahead and start So you think if trials were held by judges or experts that they would tend not to convict people on circumstantial evidence You know I attended a trial in Germany when I was a student and that's the sort of system they have The trials are held by a panel of three or four judges who are well they're like lawyers I guess They're experts in the law and there really isn't a jury and they do the questioning also The judges do the questioning and they i- I think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because the judge is also sort of a jury but I'm not sure I like that I think I prefer the jury system myself well actually I think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury what I worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual That's where you really need a jury of peers Because anytime the government is the government against the individual you need the protection of ordinary citizens I think that's really the only thing I guess where I would like to see the system change is there ought to be a well I guess I don't think that juries need to decide sentencing all the time I think maybe a judge is a better judge of that or Yeah Well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent That's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe But people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see I think that is maybe a little bit naive In Texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people it's kind of a hanging jury atmosphere But in a lot of places I think people bend over the other way but I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that I kind of like that system Yeah Yeah Yeah Right And lawyers blow sand in their eyes I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries Insurance cases and things like that Where and there would be more honest settlements instead of this tugging of people's heart strings and making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering So I think in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government but
