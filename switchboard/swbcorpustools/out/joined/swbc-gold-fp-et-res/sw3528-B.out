Fine thank you Yes well I just got through reading SPACE by James Michener And so that helped out a little bit I think Well he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes is that right Well I'm not sure to be honest with you so this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure And yeah it was nice to go there but I don't know that it really benefitted mankind that much I happen to live not too far away from well I've actually worked for the company that has been blamed for the Challenger disaster Morton Thiakol And you know that's been kind of a real negative feeling here is sure it was you know very unfortunate thing that occurred there and it's we live in Utah Uh-huh Yeah  Oh I have a sister that lives in Dallas that's how we got hooked up to the program was her husband works for Penney's there So Pardon me No my last name is Skidmore And her husband's name is + his last name is  Weight And Well they were There was apparently the specifications for the joints they were not to perform in cold weather and apparently there was definitely a joint that did not seal and if you've ever seen the size of those motors that put them into space they're as long as a football field practically and about twelve foot in diameter and there is a lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air So this book was interesting though I talked about how a lot of the problems they have to overcome to it's a very complex situation to go into space They would the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how much of a problem it is to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere Yeah Yeah But they have to come in at just the right angle If you come in at the wrong angle what happens is they bounce off and go back into space and if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up So Oh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I've + I've never  + I've never  seen an actual capsule I've seen more of the motors that they produced out there Uh-huh Yeah People have commented how they were surprised at how small they were Looked pretty confining Is that right  Not really One thing's I know one thing they've mentioned that I didn't get from the book by the way but it talked about they're able to manufacture different kinds of crystals and ball bearings and things like that in a zero gravity state that they turned out being nearly perfect as far as a ball bearing goes It's perfectly round But I'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity Yeah Uh-huh Yes I think they have cut it back to be honest with you from the glory days when they did the Apollo shots to the moon I appreciate having the satellites You know that's certainly made it nice for other purpose I don't know if you have a satellite dish or not We don't but I know that's certainly helped a lot in that regard
