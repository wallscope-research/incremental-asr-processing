Yes I try to whenever I can I've always been I guess a product of a handyman father Th- Yeah Yeah There's although I'll tell you you know over the years the cars get more complicated Right yeah Yes One of my first cars was a fifty-six Buick Which after awhile I could you know take apart in my sleep if I needed to Yeah it got to be pretty straightforward to understand and now since then you know the closer a car is to a fifty-six Buick the more I know about it And then start getting into these Nissans and the like and I just can't keep up Yeah That's right Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yes Yes I understand My last car repair actually had to do with brakes and it's one I did not do myself I took the car my I have a seventy-nine El Dorado took it to be inspected and the parking brake failed So I got under there and messed with that adjustment to tighten it up and that didn't do the trick and then I got there and tried to Well actually that wasn't even eventually the problem I did everything that I could think to do And eventually I brought it up to a place called Just Brakes and it turns out that there's a the parking brake in the rear there's disc brakes and the parking brake is a piston deal And because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years the piston froze up So they ended up having to pound it out And one of them they were able to get running kind of oiling it and playing with it and the other one it was just frozen solid so I ended up having to buy one and all total it was just under two hundred dollars believe it or not to get all that done yeah actually I think it was a lot of money but I don't like I s- Yeah but I it got to the point where I didn't know what was going on so That's right that's right I do Th- actually that was just at the beginning of September and whenever I can I do try I actually I'd say this I've gotten to the point where I don't change the oil anymore Only because Well that is one problem but also these fast oil change places you just can't beat them For sixteen bucks not only will they change the oil in ten minutes and do you know as good a job as I can do but they'll lube too Yeah Yep that's right
