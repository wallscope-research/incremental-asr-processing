Yeah to a point it's not my best subject Yeah It's a whole different culture or it's weird down there because there's always lizards and things running around that people live there they take it for granted and it's like we go down there on vacation it's like how can these people live with these lizards and like bats in their house Very very corrupt like the Panamanians were very corrupt The thing about it though is the Panamanians is a lot of servicemen down there a lot of American servicemen are involved because I guess there was a big scam that all these guys up Thousands of servicemen got caught for running a drug ring So it's like everybody is into it it's just greed Human greed Interestingly in Honduras It's very pro-American And I my girlfriend used to be in the Navy and she was based in Panama In Honduras very pro-American And there's a lot of men I don't know how many American soldiers are there but there's a lot they and the American government you can't trust them either because you think you don't know how corrupt they are they keep people in power like the Shah of Iran and things like that it's the lesser of two evils they will probably say this is the lesser of two evils But I don't know how corrupt the Honduran government is But the Yeah good See that's the thing it's going have to that's the undoing of everything and it's the we have no morals when we talk about the crime and all that in the city it's just the kids have no morals That's the thing that will eventually you know if anyone is going to be saved It is having a good moral background And it's funny you mention Costa Rica because they are one of the most successful and peaceful countries in Central America So I was reading an article in the National Geographic and I don't know I don't think they have any more money than any of the other countries they don't have oil or anything and they don't have big tourism So maybe it is their faith that enables them to keep the crime out they don't probably take a lot of refugees from other countries either Yeah also Mexico we will loan the money in a lot of the higher people were just stealing it and building these beautiful homes and nice ranches and things So we're suckers They know they're not going to pay it back Did you go to Mexico City anywhere near when the earthquake hit I can imagine really Yeah is there still blood stains on the altar or has it worn away through the years Do you get spooked you feel or do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there Because
