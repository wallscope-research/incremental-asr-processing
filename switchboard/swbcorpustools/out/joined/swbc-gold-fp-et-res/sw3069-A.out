Yeah Yes I talked with people from Richardson and Plano and the first three days and then yesterday I talked with someone from Pennsylvania so it's the Oh I know Sometimes I just I'm in it just takes a very long time so Yeah I know Well This is hilarious Well tell me what books have you read lately Well I don't read all that much for enjoyment I read a lot for school but gee I just don't have much time for enjoyment reading Uh-huh  Yeah  yeah yeah Interesting Uh-huh Yes yes yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah That kind of was kind of a pop psychology time for when a lot of books like that were coming out I think And so that makes real sense that that's when it was written I wasn't really aware that she had written anything for adults I was always just more aware of her jer- you know for her young people her books one utt Uh-huh I'll be darned Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Right yeah yeah Yeah I wonder if she's written anything really recently if she's got anything in print Uh-huh I'll be darned Yeah Yeah Well it's I'm trying to think the last actual book I read that wasn't let's see I think I read when I was you know on semester break between spring and summer and I went to my mother's I read a book that I should have read when I was probably in high school I read JANE EYRE No wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute JANE EYRE No no no no it wasn't JANE EYRE No it was PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen That's what it was yes And you know I didn't know what to expect except I had heard that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist and she really was good I was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so intricately and you know I just but as I say I was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then slash error Uh-huh slash error should be 'b' Yeah yeah Uh-huh how interesting Yeah I'll bet yeah Yeah Right I wouldn't be surprised yeah Sure yeah Well I read that and then I'm trying to think usually I try to find something long that I'm going to when if I have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or you know when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while Yeah and that's about it because otherwise I'm reading so much for school I have just started reading a book Actually it's for school but it's for there's a literary jour- well not a literary journal it's kind of a journal of the history of ideas that's starting to be published from U T D The first issue doesn't come out until next year but I'm doing some reviews of books to sort of recommend whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal and I've yeah it's really neat because these are brand new books and I got this one most of the stuff is on literary criticism and philosophy and religion and all that This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach and it's a biography that is really interesting it's fascinating it really is but it's so long I don't really have the time to read the whole thing but I think eventually I'll go back to it But it was written the copyright is nineteen ninety-one so it's a brand new book Yeah uh-huh Yeah and this man really shed some light on some aspects of Bach's genius and + you know the more sociological things you know like the idea that to be a musician was as much of a family occupation as anything you know it was families had just loads of musicians Yeah that's right Yes uh-huh and Yeah So it was just really interesting if you know that's kind of what but I have to not only am I reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also because the board of advisers for this journal right now doesn't have a really respected name who's a scholar on music and I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be you know in that position on the board so I don't know if I want to take that responsibility or not But at least I can tell them what I think so it's real interesting Yeah it is Uh-huh Yeah yeah Yes Yeah that it you know you see a lot of small colleges doing things like that right uh-huh because it attracts really a lot people's interest That's one way it's really good public relations for small schools I think so But another one of my projects this summer it's helping a professor compile a bunch of translations of various poems for a book that he's writing and so I'm learning the names if not the actual contents of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people well where for instance a Baudelaire poem that was written in the French and then has been translated into English by various people And the translations are all so different from one another Uh-huh So it's multiple translations of single works and that's right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as my work is just kind of compiling all that for him So It's real interesting slash error slash error should be 'x' well let me tell you slash error There are days when I would prefer really doing that I don't know if I've told you but this is not on the subject
