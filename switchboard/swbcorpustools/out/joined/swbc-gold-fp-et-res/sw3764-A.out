I guess you heard our topic for today was clothing How you dress for work and season to season and everything How do you dress for work Sure You bet Look professional Yeah I understand I am a I own my company I am in the manufactures rep sales organization and my office is a small office and I am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that but then when I travel it is a little different situation suits and sports coat tie and the whole bit Cause you go to meetings and you are required to look your best and look professional of course Yeah I think in today's society there is more credibility to be quite honest I will always remember I will tell this real quick story when I graduated from college my first job years ago thirty years ago twenty-nine years ago in fact was selling agricultural fertilizer I worked for the Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical and I sold you know manure And I would go out and call on farmers and I would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that but I was calling on guys that wore bib overalls And so one day I got up and thought well I will just go casual and you know that I called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional and he sort of expected me to dress as a professional so it was sort of You bet even back then so I been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best but here again I dress casual quite a bit so It gives you confidence In my business if I call on the the J C Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago then I wear coat and tie If I call on just a normal little dealer of mine I might be casual I call on Oshman's sporting goods again it may be casual or it may be coat and tie So it depends probably no Probably no Because today I believe you can get away with but then it depends on who you are calling on Who you're you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie he would be missing something Although he shouldn't be evaluated on that So its' just different Yes it is I am like a Catholic and the people that go to my Church you know Catholics dress very casual a lot of the times People in jeans and in whatever but yet the way I was raised I am a converted Catholic the way I was raised I was raised a Baptist and like as a youngster I use to always dress up all the time I guess that has changed also Right Sure But That is a very good point I am from West Virginia so I understand what you are saying there and it's a very good point But what's the old saying you shouldn't judge a book by its cover And evaluation of an individual Course all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have I think you have to dress sort of accordingly But you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and or evaluate a person by that What about season to season Does I guess your dress changes
