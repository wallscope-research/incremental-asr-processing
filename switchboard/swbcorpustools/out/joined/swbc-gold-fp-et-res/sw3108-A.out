Well what movies have you seen recently Valerie we haven't seen that one yet it wasn't that good The most recent one that my wife and I have seen was the CITY SLICKER That was excellent It was just a really funny movie At the same time it had a story line about people trying to find themselves There were parts that were sad it just ran the gamut of emotion but it was just all around entertaining it's still on to the best of my knowledge  I think it's less than two hours we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever Yeah but this one it was fairly long I'm guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes maybe But excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby who was the Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy So we really enjoyed that Yeah I think that I can highly recommend that movie to see Yeah we generally rent a couple a week in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend you've got to rent it on Thursday they get taken up at the store so We will rent two or three movies on Thursday and with luck you'll have one or two that are good Most of them are a coin flip Yeah Yeah well Quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends and we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see and generally try to stay in the at least P G range the oldest is nine the youngest is three He doesn't really pay attention The five year old doesn't have the attention span either But the nine year old will watch anything that's on T V So Yeah my wife took I think the kids to see that one but we can generally find something at the store for them to watch The we saw this movie PRESUMED INNOCENT was the one we rented last weekend Harrison Ford he is a prosecuting attorney and a woman prosecutor in there is murdered and he's trying to find it but course it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her And it's an extremely long movie it's over two hours long Which my wife she likes the suspense movies I enjoy them to a degree Save that for another day Yeah Yeah it's something I think you would enjoy yes it's like most suspense movies what was it was on T V recently FATAL ATTRACTION It's one that once you've seen it once you really can't see it again so you know all the story and who did what and when it happened so once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that then it's not good for a second watching particularly At least I don't think so I don't know we've watched WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S any number of times It's just slapstick comedy Sit there and laugh and my one grandson and I my wife can't understand it but we like BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE which is another funny one Yeah we like to laugh I have a theory I like movies for entertainment I don't want to go away depressed from watching a movie Life's depressing enough Well I've certainly enjoyed talking with you Okay bye Have a nice weekend Okay Bye
