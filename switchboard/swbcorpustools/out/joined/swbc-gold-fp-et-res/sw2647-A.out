Okay I guess I'll start one big thing that the advise that I would give to a parent to give to his or her child is to let their child experience college in a kind of general sense I like large colleges because I went to University of Texas at Austin they have fifty thousand students there And I feel like that now if I had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that I wouldn't have gotten as much exposure to different people and I don't know different languages different cultures and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh <> Huh Uh-huh Right <> Uh-huh <> Yeah Yeah I could see how it would be I'm sure your classes were a lot smaller because like we would have main courses that everyone has to take hundreds of students in this class so actually you were a number But I just I don't know I'm thinking in a sense of just being exposed to more It just seems like in a larger college I don't know your exposed to so many more people from all over the world and I'm sure a lot of people come to you know small colleges also but just that they're more of the different cultures there not that it's better but I'm just saying that I think that big Uh-huh uh-huh I think a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college a lot of the students that I talked to even here in Waco they go to Baylor or they're considering going to Baylor they're also considering going to U T Austin but one of the big no-nos is because of the fifty thousand students and I have to tell them that just like I live in Waco it's a large city I can still function in my own kind of area in my own group I have a job I have my friends and I'm really not as concerned about the entire city so when you go to a big university you're not as concerned about the entire university but your group of friends your classes your interests your clubs and things like that Uh-huh Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Uh-huh right Right Right Uh-huh Uh-huh On paper Uh-huh exactly that's one important thing that I think about school I'm not a kind a person that I didn't I was kind of a B student I guess you'd say and I didn't really I was tur- I strived to be an A student but it wasn't like a real priority To my priority was just being as worldly as I could possibly be getting into as many organizations as I possibly could and one other point I was going to make was that I can see that probably if I had gone to a smaller school I would probably have more friends because like you said you know you know everybody knows everybody and so you probably come out of it knowing and by friends like contacts for when you get out of school you know you may walk into a company and see someone you went to school with more so at a small college then a large college You may have gone to school with them but you wouldn't know them I guess let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Wow Uh-huh Right Wow That's great Right right That's great that's great Yeah that's basically what I and when I first I've been out of college only two years now so it's still pretty fresh on my memory but now that I'm out when I went into school my parents told well my okay let me go back to my sister now is in college and my father was really interested in getting her in a school that would look good on her diploma etcetera and so forth and I kept pushing her towards just kind of U T or a larger school and it was just a big conflict between us because my father wanted the academics and I wanted her to get the life experience out of it and so it was you know she went the academic way because she's a straight A student which is yes yeah so she you know that's probably you know what she wants anyway but that was the big deal and Right Right And that's another point is that a parent should tell their child to be or to give their child the leeway to choose their school not so much choose the school for them but you know kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're going to do Uh-huh Right Huh Right uh-huh <> Uh-huh <> Right Well that was pretty courageous Yeah yeah yeah I'm dealing with the loans right now so slash error yes slash error very every month That memory just seeps back in my mailbox well I guess I'll get over it yeah yeah Okay Uh-huh Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Right because when you do finally graduate that's what you need the most I'm finding out now that what I'm needing the most now is not smarts not what I can do on paper it's stamina courage words it Yes you know I'm needing to rely on myself And I think I learned a lot of that in school too
