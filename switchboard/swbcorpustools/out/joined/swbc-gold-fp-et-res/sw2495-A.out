So what is your latest experience with painting Uh-huh Right Isn't that amazing it looks so easy just slapping paint on I had an addition put on because my inner room looked so dingy because I put these beautiful French doors in and so I decided okay I'll just you know have them paint this little room you know a little ten by ten dining area It took four days And even the painter couldn't give me a good estimate He said Well I'll be done this afternoon you know and pretty soon before you know it you know he's run into so many problems and it's just there's nothing there to be a problem I thought but it just took him so much longer and he was there to paint the French doors also and if you've ever painted French doors which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do because it looked so formidable then just we got this painter and I just called him because I got a little ad out of you know the adcose or whatever in the mail and you know just got this painter person over here And he said Yeah I can finish it in a day right so the whole project basically took a week Funny And I go what makes you a professional You know How much you know more do you know than I know about this whole situation but he just kept painting on those French doors you know and each little paint stroke you know the paint wasn't going on right is what it was So he had to redo them like three times before I was happy with them before he was happy you know that they even looked halfway decent and so it's just been painting yeah hire a professional but that doesn't guarantee anything Right no and that can make a difference too and they bring the you know little samples and you've got like maybe five hundred well that's an exaggeration but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints and you don't know what you to want to put up there and by the time it's on  I + I selected what I thought was white and it was like you said you know it was blue cast to it And it looked awful on So that was the next problem He had to redo that too I This was a and it was a major project getting the money together to do it too by the end of the whole project but you know we worked something out because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long He really came over here to paint I think because he kept offering to paint the outside of my house I don't think he did the interiors very well And yeah No Uh-huh It wasn't a big deal for them I don't know I think my husband's really glad about that For sure you just get in there and do it yourself Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well it's not that easy It's like it's I don't even know if you know I would not even recommend this person again to anybody I don't know A I guess you ge- I don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say Well I'll accept something or you just really have to get on their back about things and working with what they say are professional painters  I tell you what the fumes that the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do any- the fumes are amazing and I don't think I could stay sane you know working with all that So I know it's not lead based any more paints but my goodness I well yeah I think so it does Oh Yeah Right Well maybe there are some professionals out there It makes you wonder Really it does for all that Well I hope you have a nice day today And you take care Okay Okay Bye Kay
