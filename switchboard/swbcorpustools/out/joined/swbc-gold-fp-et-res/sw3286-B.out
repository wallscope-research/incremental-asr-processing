So what do you think about it Right Yeah I guess that's so I think there's some problems but they're not really big ones I think that in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be That it's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here even if they're educated and will be a good asset to America It's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that Okay where did you come from Okay Okay so where did your parents come from Okay And Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yep Uh-huh I'm from Pennsylvania Yeah Right and a lot of Uh-huh Yeah I think that's all right I at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing Do you have an opinion about it Uh-huh Uh-huh No okay Right Well a lot of the experience that I have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who's Chinese and immigrated from China And you know he got a green card and is in good standing in America and China but only because he was always nice to the Chinese government and all that and he was always on pretty good terms with them But their my sister just had a baby and they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to America to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing And it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem It's just very difficult to get a woman who doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily to visit here Yeah Uh-huh Right Yeah and I think that's pretty crazy because those students who were in America when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back and aside for that they're the best and brightest of China so it's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can <> Yeah Uh-huh Yeah  See these are refujees you mean Okay Right okay Right Well I don't have any problem with that Yeah I guess so Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah
