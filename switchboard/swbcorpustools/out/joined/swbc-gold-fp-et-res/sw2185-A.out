Well I was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that I've done And the last time that we tackled it I did the kitchen And I had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark it was called a sassafras it was kind of an orangish brown It was not real pretty Anyway so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color So I tried to cover it with white and it was quite a feat getting that dark a color covered and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets and if I look underneath my cabinets I'm not satisfied with the jobs I did on it because there're splotches But I'm glad it's done because it's brighter lord Uh-huh yeah So what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it's dried Uh-huh And it's not scratching your floor because it's so thick that's pretty good We painted every room in this house some of them like two three times We have two children And they just they ruin it's just terrible what they do And then I have been coloring my hair and I'm real haphazard when I do it So I've got dye on my bathroom door And I haven't figured out how to get that off I guess I'll have to take that door down and really get it good And then we have a two story We did the outside of it one summer That was horrendous I couldn't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder I could get up on the roof and do that But I dread that the next time Uh-huh No I wouldn't think so Have you guys tackled your ceilings yet we got to do that this summer We're dreading it It's like they're dark Everything else is white Now have you thought about this That wherever you buy your paint you need to make sure that that store's not likely to go out of business Uh-huh but I still feel good the minute I put that paint on even if it does got a dent in it I do what else can I tell you about painting and I get it all in my hair too Do you do that Spots in it Are you having to repair the walls at all that's smart So where do you live I'm in Garland Did you try to call this weekend To that switchboard did you keep getting that it was down You didn't Yeah well I've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything I don't know I can't think of anything else to say about painting It hurts your back and it hurts your arm Yeah But you're glad you're doing it right Uh-huh Do you have one of those straightedge things to put underneath when you're doing the baseboards On your baseboards You don't have any carpet down in your house See we've got carpet and I haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it on down so that you won't see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet Because every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it You can't hold it there until it's dried
