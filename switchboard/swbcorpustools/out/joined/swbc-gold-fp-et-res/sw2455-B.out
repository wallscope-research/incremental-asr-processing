Have you been talking to males Yeah yeah this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female Right Uh-huh Right Yeah it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore the women are spreading themselves thinner than before Uh-huh Do you work outside the home Do you have children Uh-huh sure Right Yeah I think that while it's a good change for I think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel you know their expertise may be I think sometimes other things suffer and tha- I think it's hard to find a balance there Right Yeah yeah I have little children four and one and I decided that it was very important to me to stay home and when I happen to you know be I'm very active with other people with children my age and most of us do tend to stay home but when I run into people that you know just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time there's almost a friction between us Uh-huh not people that are you know necessarily good friends Even though that has happened too it's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence You know w- if you decide to go back to work then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself And if you don't then sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you're just wasting your time at home Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah Right Yeah Uh-huh No that's definitely true In fact I work out of my home I'm an accountant and I do taxes and bookkeeping and I it was it's a way for me to stay home And I still unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night but it's worked out for my family to have my cake and eat it too kind of thing Well I hope that they will change but I'm I just I know it's going to be a slow change I feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner I'm just thinking of my circle of people that I know I know quite a few people who have decided to not have you know both of the parents work And yet I we- I hope to see employer based you know helping out You know child care centers at the place of employment and things like that that will help out What do you think do you think we are setting a trend Uh-huh Right Right it's a very personal thing Yeah I think it's hard though when you talk about families and raising children because I think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground I think they need security and yet they I don't know I from speaking from my children they aren't real flexible when it comes to things like that they want to know things are going to be a certain way Uh-huh right Well we will see I'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society yes the numbers are still very skewed to say the least Okay you too Ellen Bye-bye
