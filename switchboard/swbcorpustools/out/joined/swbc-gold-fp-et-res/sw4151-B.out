That's a good question there was a point where I would have said no that no one would deserve to die for a crime that he committed But since I've become a parent and since I've seen things like Jeffrey Dahlmer I really have to question that I can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people And try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment  it's a question of your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response and that was the thing that killed Dukakis back four years ago when someone asked him a similar question and he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when people wanted to see if he was going to go for a gut level reaction And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level you know whether it be a biblical force you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life type logic or just some sort of anger at putting murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life while we foot the bill I think people are working at that from more of a gut reaction than a reason humane one That's true the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't agree with that I don't think anyone who would commit a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say well I was about to kill and dismember this person but if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it I just don't think that it works that way Uh-huh Well I don't know if that would really work that way or not there's a lot of violence
