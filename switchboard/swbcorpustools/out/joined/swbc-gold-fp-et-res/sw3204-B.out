What is it about nursing homes Yeah Uh-huh Right it's very difficult I know Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah Yeah how old is she see my father is ninety-two and he and mother still live at the house and drive and do the whole thing but you know whenever something happens to one of them then I don't know what I'll do up there I just know too many horror stories about nursing homes and so They're in Missouri and I know stories for sure that  they just well they  can't take the proper care of them Most of them And it's tragic that you know when people live so long that they really don't have a place to go So Right Yeah there's one very close to where my parents are but I think it would be nice but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything So he's from that old depression era and you know it's just blissfull that they're both able to do everything for themselves I would imagine that if something happens I'll move one of them or bot- you know in with me So But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is but I think you'd have to really they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on this homes But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot And so many people when they put people in the nurses home they never see them They never go to see them I've talked to many owners of places and say that nobody even maybe Christmas Uh-huh Right I do too Or if they could be real real nearby where they could see them everyday or so because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes regulation in Texas so maybe we'll get it improved So Anyway Right it's tough I'm sure Oh Right that would be devastating I'm sure so It is a tough decision and it's one that needs a great deal of thought and prior probably Yeah Right Uh-huh Right I would hope we could do that and then go from there Well anyway We've covered a little bit and it's good to hear from you and Have a good Have a good lif-
