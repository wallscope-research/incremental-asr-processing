Well hi I guess I'll just start by saying that we entertain with a gourmet club here which means that we have like eight people four couples And most of the husbands this is really peculiar most of the husbands cook the wives during the day you know get I guess so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff but it was the guys that got together and did all this And like my husband just he really really likes to cook in terms of barbecue and all guys I think like to barbecue I think it's caveman I'm telling you but he really does cook and it's a good thing because you know you can't knock that But all these other guys do too and so we've gotten together and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals And it's really really kind of a neat thing to do You Well we try because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that It's like you know if we can do it once every six months we're doing well Yeah So we originally started out you know when we were younger and didn't have so much stuff going on with the kids then we tried to do it every other month but lately it's just been once every six months Yeah Oh Really really it is absolutely Yeah Right yeah Well yeah that's true And we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish so he can get within my yeah It sure d- it makes you keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out for something like Right So we try to keep all that in mind but otherwise I guess you know entertaining I guess I have recipes I but that's basically what we do is the gourmet so you know they would be pretty elaborate but it's fun it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff and you know you get all prepared but you're right It's very very rich and I'm glad we don't have it every because it's quite a treat it really is  Right but so you like food and I just love the community of food I just think it's neat I just love sharing meals and whatever you can do you know to do that I don't think you have to be you know more than hamburgers and hot dogs out in the backyard and the coleslaw and potato salad but Oh What are you providing Right Right There you go I know We're all not built like what Martha Stewart you know We all aren't Martha Stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and time to you know t- Yeah Shot a video of the whole thing I don't know But it's really kind of a neat thing I get a kick out of it I really do Everything all parts of the food I love to make things from scratch you know Making breads and you know people really pretty much appreciate it I think so Oh Oh Oh There you go Oh it is we have bakeries around here that you know you just gain weight going by the door you know just like that Right but I don't know I guess some of the best things I've ever had some of them were just hors d'oeuvres you know Doing little hors d'oeuvre things that I have a kick making that you know I get off on strange little details of food I guess But gee we have so much going on here because you know this is Dallas this is the southwest this is you know chips and Picante sauce and anything hot You know you can always make it hotter and lots of stuff like that you know so That's a really good party time eating all that hot food and they just love it you know down here It just you know all the stuff that goes with that so I'm not Thank you for noticing I'm from Chicago And how I got Really and how I got to Texas by way of Virginia and everything is a long story But Yeah Well absolutely I in fact it just came to mind and this
