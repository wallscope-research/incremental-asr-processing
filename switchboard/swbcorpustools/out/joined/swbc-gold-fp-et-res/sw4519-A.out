Your turn Well I have to say I really don't have a budget Both my wife and I grew up in families of rather modest means and our family income at this point is comfortable Upper middle class I guess you might say And we're both so frugal that we really don't need a budget you know We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing Well we stay within our means but we don't do it by conscious effort It just sort of happens automatically Although we just moved to California and the cost of living here in California is I would say rather pathological housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than <> they were where I came from in Dallas Yeah So that presents a real shock actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California but Yeah It's God's country and one way you know that is that only God can afford it so budget is not a problem for us at least it hasn't been It may be at this point But up until this point it really hasn't been When I was in undergraduate school a long long time ago I noted that the starting average monthly <> salary for engineers you know in my discipline was like six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that And I noted at that point that you know if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever So I stopped worrying about money And it never have worried about money since then Sometimes it's a bit of a problem you know because I guess I don't really manage my money the way I should But I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of investments but Uh-huh Well I guess we're both lucky in that regard then How big is your family I see <> So how once you get ten children though you may have all right I have two kids one nine and one thirteen and they are beginning to be a budget problem but have not been really up to this point I give them an allowance {C and they I basically give my son ten dollars a week and I put half of it in the bank and I give him the other half in cold cash And he has a teller card so he can do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank But at least it isn't you know burning a hole in his pocket If he wants to use it he has to go get it and that usually
