Actually I'm real close to being in the market to buy a car I've got a couple older cars they're both over ten years old and they've served me well but I kind of would like to get a more gas efficient car and a newer model something looks a little nicer I've got three children at home Two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old and so I need to make sure I've got one that I can fit all five of us into And if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time Well I've kind of been leaning towards a Caravan now I know that they've gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years but I like the Dodge products and couple times I've had a opportunity to rent one I've been really pleased with its performance and with the size and because if you get the seven passenger version you can put some space between the kids And I think that would serve us well Plus it's got good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along going to the store Uh-huh Exactly correct Yeah if you want Yes Yeah it the Dodge Caravans will do that you can take the usually there's a double seat behind the front buckets And then if you get the and then there's a three person seat that goes in the back Now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out and just have the three seats in the back and the two seats up front or you can take the three seat out and just use the two seat or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back So it's very versatile You can move the seats all around About the only thing you can't do is take that three person across seat and move it forward Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I think that's getting to be kind of important now that the price is becoming the driving factor and then you look at once you realize how much money you've got to spend then you start looking around at what you can buy with it where before I think you looked at the car you wanted and then you looked to see how well you could afford it Or how you could afford it Yeah Yeah I know they're trying to do everything they can to end the recession And dropping the prime is probably one of the things I just bought a new house so I got a nine and a half percent interest rate I'm not sure I could do much better today But that is also effecting buying a new car Well that and that two fourteen year olds will be fifteen on the fourth of July so Yeah they're twins born on the bicentennial You're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial is our motto July fourth seventy-six So I've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be behind the wheel of a car So America's safe for another fifteen m- and after that now I may keep one or both of the two cars I currently have for them to drive You know they're small enough that a first time driver could handle it yet big enough that I feel safe that if they were in an accident they would survive Know what I mean I don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the Honda They're just Uh-huh Is that right Uh-huh Right Jeez Well Yes Definitely The thing is that they're I think it's a two part seat belt though there's the door belt and then there's one a lap belt Make sure you smack him around then Yeah Yeah Yeah the supports a good source of information I've found has always been these used car manuals because you can flip through the used car manuals and they'll give you a list of all the problems that the car's had in the past And you can look at the track record on a car over the year and you usually notice a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out to where there's fewer problems And you get an idea on how well the next car's going to be Now as long as they aren't changing the model you know like when the Pontiac Grand Prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems with the smaller car As long as they aren't Uh-huh Yeah sure Uh-huh Yeah I remember when that happened So unless they're really changing the model yeah chances are that it's probably going to have the fewer mistakes than it had the year before Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I agree Uh-huh Yeah
