I do yes I guess it actually changes I do a number of different things simply walking with my wife and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle and then moving up I run in the mornings not every morning it probably averages about two days a week and then with my wife I actually go to the gym and lift weights which isn't I understand quite exercising but it's along the lines How about yourself Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right That's right Right So you look at it more as a task Right I see Right right So I'm thirty-two years old which is probably different than yourself and so it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise My job at Texas Instruments I have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so that I don't get any exercise doing that and plus there's a build up of stress so I need to go out and take those walks after dinner and I need to go out in the morning and run or I'll just get nuts so that's kind of a motivator so even though I can look at it as a task you know I get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by saying Well I'm lowering my chance of heart attack and that type stuff Sure that all I do all that Yeah Right Well it's a something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable I do that at the end of the day and it takes you know during that time the stress from the day goes away I get to share whatever I did with my wife and vice versa Going to the gym is actually something different than like and the running and I enjoy that too Year I've been running since high school on track teams and the like so running I'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more and you don't think about the pain of it you take the time to relax some how and you think about other things During those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you can't breathe and this and that and that's no fun And it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people Yeah the weight lifting on the other hand is actually I think I look better I'm not a huge person I'm just a regular looking guy but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is attractive so that pays also Yeah so I guess that aspect of that takes away the work with my wife which is nice I love her you know I enjoy being with her I guess that's one thing but also that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles Yeah yeah I don't let that bother me but yeah that's something that comes with time too You know I'll tell you the sit ups and push ups are excellent you know it's your own you're struggling against your own body weight you can have variety by putting your feet higher or lower by putting your arms further apart or closer together by doing them real quick or real slow and you can actually get a good wo- I know in the push up at least you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups is that right Right Yeah Right That's funny Yeah Yeah Well you know maybe not I'd say at twenty-two you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting the exercise otherwise When your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan and what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle when you add a plan to your life something else has to go away and that's the hard decision is okay if I'm going to run in the mornings what do I trade it off for Well the answer's sleep right If I'm going to walk at night what do I trade it off for Well Star Trek or you know it's always trade offs and you actually as you get older you have to really think what can go and what to replace this thing It's not just exercise but anything It's very hard And I don't think you should worry about not having a program yet Yep Yeah I guess if you care or if your future wife gives you a reason to care which helps Well I think we covered it Nice talking with you Craig You too Good day Bye
