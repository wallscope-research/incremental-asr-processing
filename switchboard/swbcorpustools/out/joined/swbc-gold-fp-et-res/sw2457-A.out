Well Amy it's been kind of overcast today and cloudy We have our I have a son in kindergarten he was having a kite day and I was really worried about it raining because there's been some dark clouds and it's been pretty rainy looking Uh-huh I know it just has that I it looks several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day and not done anything And we have a lot of trees in our yard and I probably they're pretty old big tall trees and so if it's an overcast day then the weather is pretty blah Because I really have to catch some sunshine or else I feel like I live in a cave all the time Uh-huh I bet Yeah That makes a big difference but I we're kind of new to Plano and I'm working on a carnival that's going to be in a couple of weeks for our school and I'm thinking that this has been pretty you know rainy season and it's been kind of scary it's kind of been cloudy every day and I thought well I'm just not anxious to have worry about the weather Well yeah Uh-huh Well I know in I'm from Missouri and we always had pretty nice four seasons and you know ex- we have some extreme weather in each season but I like that and we moved here from Houston in July and everyone kept saying you're going up north it's not going to be so hot it's not going to be so humid Yeah that has just not been the case It has been it was extremely hot I thought I was going to die my car I thought it was going die last Summer but Well the air conditioning was broke but broken I guess it just couldn't handle the stress and the record heat and you know I was worried about every time we came to an intersection the car started idling rough you know because of the extreme heat Uh-huh I know That's really awful but I understand that this is kind of typical for this time of year that rainy season Uh-huh No Sure Brown Yeah that is awful and it takes time and the kids they you have to water your lawn and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy You know so you're going do I want a green lawn or a muddy feet in the house no Well I don't know do the nice thing I'm looking forward to is not having a hurricane season Yes we always had big concern about hurricanes and they're close enough to the coast and you know you had to have a supply like emergency supply on hand all the time during the hurricane season and it was pretty spooky because you always have to think you know what's the weather doing Right And do we have enough you know food storage and enough batteries and all the kinds of things That's right So Uh-huh Well yeah I don't really like tornadoes either but at least there isn't I feel like I got rid of something hurricanes so not too much of that Yeah and it is and I can't believe the record temperatures that were here last Summer that it was just unbelievably hot That is pretty bad I know I can't imagine Even well that would it is just pretty bad but I guess the weather hasn't changed too much from here to Houston But it is like you say coming a little bit further up north It's a little bit nicer to have a Spring and a Fall season where you have some pleasant weather everyday where you can feel like you just want to open your windows and Uh-huh And get some fresh air in the house and it feels good but I guess No but I remember no Now that sounds awful Now I have seen those I have driven around in the neighborhoods and seen those little flood gauges that will be at little yellow signs it's you know has it like from one foot to four foot and I thought I would never buy a house with a flood gauge down the street Yeah that would be awful Well I've got some kids out on the trampoline I need to go look and see what they're doing Well you too Bye-bye
