Okay well my favorite probably all time T V show is STAR TREK And I would it like that I like the adventure of it And the idea that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space And then I like the they have a new one now The STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION Which it's an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and doing new things and finding out about different people and I've always liked that show probably the very best Uh-huh Yeah those the movies are good too And I guess most of the shows I like are are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure when I started thinking about this those are some of my favorite shows MCGYVER because it's only one person there you know instead of a cast of people but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and you know pieces of baling wire and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider and You haven't Uh-huh He's like a semigovernment type agent Who works for the Phoenix Foundation supposedly And his big thing is that he can take little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things He took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder So he does all kinds of strange things like that Yeah See what we can come up with Do you like the news shows TWENTY TWENTY SIXTY MINUTES those kind of things Uh-huh Some of the little things yeah  Oh I guess I haven't ever had any trouble with that I have my favorite shows and I usually make time in my day or my week you know to watch those But for the most part I have small kids and I try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time really when they're up Because they're I guess that falls and one of my other favorite shows is SESAME STREET because of the kids I like that real well I don't think they have that on anymore I haven't seen the ELECTRIC COMPANY in a long time I remember it when I was younger you know catching it on P B S but I don't think they show it must be in maybe it's in if it was in repeats but they're not making new ones I haven't seen it in a long time But SESAME STREET is still really good Yes Yeah They still show MISTER ROGERS I don't think he's making new ones but they repeat all the old ones So that's still a real good show too I that one tends to come on earlier in the day than I want to turn the T V on SESAME STREET comes on from like nine to ten which is a good time and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go so it's the timing of it is good besides the amo- what's on Yes I have two little ones So they like that They come on both They come on like from nine to ten and then from five to six They just repeat over again Which is also another thing that's good about it when it comes on right in the dinner hour I can feel like I can let them sit in front of the T V and watch and they're watching something worthwhile while I can make dinner and do things I need to do without them under foot Yeah it didn't hurt them any Some shows are good for I think some STAR TREK I for the imagination of it all The idea I think that's one of the things I like about STAR TREK And is the even in for kids watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff I don't let my little ones watch it but the imagination of look what we can do you know in the future perhaps this will be possible That kind of thing Okay well I think we've covered most of my favorite T V shows Let's see how about MAN FROM UNCLE That's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE Yeah they always have I've seen some of them on repeats That they always had a good plot It kind of kept you guessing on what was going to happen next How they're going get out of their latest scrape yeah every Saturday night   Ye- I'm not old enough to recall that one My T V viewing started sort of mid-sixties so my folks I'm not even sure if we had one when I was really little That may be why bu- they probably didn't have a T V until I got to be you know grade school or so And the shows that I like now they wouldn't let me watch I had to catch them all on repeats Like STAR TREK they thought that was much too violent for small children So I ended up watching a lot of these things on you know repeats in the afternoons or something Yeah Probably so Well I think that's about covered it for me so I think I'll say good-bye and we'll talk another time perhaps I'm calling from Garland Texas Uh-huh Where are you from my goodness I didn't know they did it long distance Yes Well it was nice talking to you Bye-bye
