Okay what do you think about the idea of having volunteer service for everyone Well are you doing any kind of volunteer work now What about when would people do it when they finished high school I think particular boys that the maturity in fact I wasn't very mature when I left high school and I think there's a real challenge there There's also this issue of you know whether you're really ready and I think it gives a different perspective The only complication is how do you fund something like this Yeah I think the Mormon church sends out missionaries that it's interesting It gets them away from home and gets them to do something useful although the kids today though it seems almost that their concern for money we were doing some investigating colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in trying to find a job study something that will give them a job as opposed to be curious as to if if there was mandatory you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary do you think that would be reasonable Well but the issue of which what would you have them do You know there are a lot of people around with there's a lot of unemployment right now What would you have these people do if they were brought in Well yeah Or say the volunteer say that it was mandatory Yes my father was in the C C C Well it seems that there's some things like the programs at least just go around and clean up streets and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things Yeah in fact we helped with Help To Help Humanities and that was a good experience but you take the kids out and a lot of the buildings in downtown areas that either need demolishing or need fixing up so it would be a good idea we've been doing this three or four minutes I think that do you have any other further comments Well it was good talking to you Betty Have a good night
