well we do have one in our home it's on the fritz right now because the monitor isn't working properly but it has been used tremendously mostly by my children for playing games However you know the bane of our existence these days but it does have a word processing program which all of us have used for reports and papers and that sort of thing wow Uh-huh Oh yeah Yeah Actually it would be worth it if he were able to get a program that would do something that he normally had to do by hand Exactly and there are lots of them on the market But you do have to research that find out what works for your system What kind do you have well that's a nice computer Uh-huh so she took it with her Yeah don't blame her Uh-huh Yeah well well encourage her to try other things because I am I work in a school system and I teach writing and we use the computers a great deal for word processing you know because students really do seem to be freer when they write on the computer as you probably found out yourself but I also am sponsoring a literary magazine and we're doing our entire layout on the computer because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have a publishing program So it is wonderful once you get into some of the programs that are out now you can do so much with them that you don't do until you really make yourself use them You have to make yourself do it yeah Yeah Uh-huh Oh so you don't need a personal one Yeah Yeah yeah Right Well my son is studying electronic technology and he's been able to do things on the personal computer here that really have enhanced his reports and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way and I guess it if you're doing that sort of thing it's really useful but unless it is I guess it's kind of a waste that's fascinating Uh-huh Yeah I knew what you meant yeah Yeah Yeah Yes you can do wonderful design it's really s- + well especially when anyone who's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering drawing you have to be so precise Yeah well Yeah Uh-huh boy What a change huh Yeah Right Well that's good Well they vary tremendously because you can get because they're the ones that were made a few years ago have come down in price significantly I've seen them for five and six hundred dollars but they have much less memory and capable of much less no you can't do very much on them Right Right well it's just that you have to be able to get your program in and many of the programs are so big they take up so much space that you don't have any place then to work You don't have any bytes left but you want to go into one that's really useful you're going to have to go over a thousand dollars and even for a personal computer it's probably smart to spend that much and we've ours is not quite that powerful and so you know we are limited which may be one reason why yeah uh-huh some things we can't do {C but then we haven't needed to either you know but we've been able to do what we can No but I mine is not as good as a P C Junior yeah Yeah ours is a Commodore One Twenty-eight And it's not quite as useful not quite as powerful So They did yeah that's very true that's very true they did Sounds that you were right Yeah And she could have bought a typewriter also Yeah yeah Yeah it yeah it prob- if it doesn't she could easily put it on Yeah right Right Which program did you use Did you use Word Perfect yeah Uh-huh Yeah they're great you're right Well I guess we've spent our time I need to go help my daughter do something so this has been fun talking to you Good luck bye-bye
