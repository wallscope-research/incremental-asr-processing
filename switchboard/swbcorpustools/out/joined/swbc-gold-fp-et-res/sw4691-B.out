so Well it let's put it this way We've got the New England Patriots up here so They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years Yeah well partly due to ownership You know Victor Kiam owned the Patriots for a period of a number of years and he always had this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something and they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth And it recently was sold to some other people so hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and keep the Patriots in the New England area anyways yeah I've been to a few games before Now you're from Texas So you've got two football teams down there Uh-huh I see There's that type of segregation Wow Uh-huh Do you Uh-huh Do you follow professional sports at all Yeah Well it's a good past time you know Particularly football They say football attracts more men because of the physical aggression on the field and supposedly psychologists say that men take out their frustrations by watching football and you know they get together with a bunch of guys and they have a good time and everything and that's suppose to be some of the male bonding and the the male instincts I guess or something about the Well no it's good in terms of a contest I think that I personally like hockey better because it's a contact sport It has the speed And the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey Not everybody can play hockey So we and that's we're a big hockey area up here I bet up here in New England as well as you know in the Minnesota area but What hockey No there's no hockey there's no There's no professional hockey teams in Texas Yeah I think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now Like they have this World Football League You see we have the N F L that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams There are those teams that play in professional National Football League but now they have what's called the World Football League and they have all these teams from there's a team in London and there's other European teams and there's teams in the United States and they're playing now during the summer months and it's really you know overkill And there's only so much football you can watch Yeah that's good Yeah Uh-huh Now have you ever been to a professional football game Have you Did you do the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole Well see now see that's what you got to do see Now we talked our Yeah yeah You the well the same thing we talked our wives there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games And we talked our wives into going with us one time and they had a real good time and it was basically for the social atmosphere You go you know three or four hours before the game You go set up We set a table up we do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more but that whole it's not so much sure the contest itself and the game itself but it's the whole atmosphere of playing of going to a game slash error I- that you miss sitting home in your parlor you know with a six pack of beer and some potato chips you know you miss that and any professional sport I think you miss that The atmosphere of being there you know Yep Well foot-
