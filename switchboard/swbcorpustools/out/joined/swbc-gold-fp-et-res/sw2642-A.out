Okay how do you feel about them Yeah Well we have this philosophy we use it when we go off somewhere but we pay for it as soon as we come back you know as soon as we get our bills we pay it off And we only have one We tore all the rest of them up Because I don't like credit cards for one thing you know they're okay I guess if you're on a trip or something you don't have to take a whole bunch of you know cash with you but I don't like using them because I've seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on chapter thirteen and stuff like that Because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card you don't have to pay for it Yeah yeah and it gives you a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say well I don't have to pay for it now but you're going to have to pay for it and it seems like Uh-huh Right Are you married okay Well I know that a lot of young people you know I it took me a long time to get it through my child's head that was her goal you know got to have a credit card but now that she has one she's only used it one time but she wanted to establish some credit but I think it finally sunk in you know because she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them say you know well I used a credit card And my husband's sister is the world's worst at well I'll just use the credit cards and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit You know and I'm thinking woman wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you But Right and people don't see that either Right The only one that we have that we kept was the Discover card and it pays you to use it if you pay your bill off right away if you don't ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them any interest Now it's and people say well you know I'm making money by using this credit card but they don't realize that if they it only takes one time for you to use it and not pay the interest you have to pay the interest not pay it right off that's going to take up what you would have made So that's the only reason that we kept that we debated for a long time plus they don't have that charge on it you know like Yeah Right They don't have one of those So it we decided that was it you know and everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card we could have credit cards running down our ears Yes yes And then I'll have just like department stores They'll call me up you know and I'll say look I don't want the credit card well we're just going to send it to you you know you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to They'll send me any credit card I tear it up I just can't see it Uh-huh Yeah I know it and you know what What's really bad about those though is just like young people if they don't you know we take the time to you know help my daughter she's in college but this is her first credit card thing well when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal Look at this they sent me this money you know So then when I explained to her look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest and stuff of course she tore it up But a lot of parents would not take the time you know and they wouldn't even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and I are and you know they may not even discuss it they go out and cash their check thinking that you know they've got something maybe they've won something You know somebody sent them something free And go out and spend it And it's just unreal I don't like credit cards I wish that they would come up with some other way to you know the only way you could use them is if you were like on vacation They would let you use it maybe once a year You know of course I guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but I have seen so many people and I have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen She got I can't remember what she called it it's some kind of maybe it's sure or something like that it's some weird name of a credit card and she is charging out of her mind already And I'm going you just got off That's how you got on to it to start with you know what is the matter with this person But it seems like you know they just think well I can just have anything I want And I just don't see it like that Of course I always see pay the bills first and whatever's leftover that's what you have but maybe a lot of people don't see it like that but I can't stand owing I cannot fully tolerate to owe something like you know I guess it's just because I've been brought up like that But I could not charge to the limit and knowing that I was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to payout But that's just the way I feel about it Right <> yeah <> yeah I guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that But I guess it's because I'm older I I'm not real old but I am older and you know I didn't feel like I had to have everything I guess it was because well I had everything when I was at home but I don't know why I didn't <> uh-huh <> yeah  Yeah well it didn't hurt you did it to you didn't go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything did you Yeah well you learned then right Yeah Uh-huh
