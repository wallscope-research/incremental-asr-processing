Well I'll tell you why I feel so I feel strongly about this topic I don't know a whole lot about the immigration laws But I do know that in the where I live and I teach school there are so many Orientals that have come here and there's a lot of Mexican people too Which is not neither here nor there but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent very wise in money matters and have taken over a lot of businesses and have Really ki- it's kind of scary because they're so bright all the kids that I have that are Oriental are really far above the American kids And they and the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up And money is their main goal And it really is kind of scary because there's just oodles of them And you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals And it's kind of scares me not that I don't want them here and not that I don't appreciate the fact you know that they have rights too But on the other hand you feel like almost they're invading us to the point where they're going to take over I think probably that's a good idea Because I lived in Iowa for about ten years before I came here And I was born in Ohio so it really and there are a lot of Mexican people here because we're so close to the border and they are wonderful people and you know I don't want to deny them their rights Just that you you feel like when you were born and raised here and you worked very hard to make this country what it is it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over And a lot of these people plan one day to go back you know to Vietnam or to you know Taiwan or wherever they're from And take with them a lot of American dollars plus a lot of power in American companies And it's kind of scary And you know I don't know I don't know the immigration laws that well and I do not and in fact I don't know them at all I don't know how many people they allow in the United States per year or if there's even a I don't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore Do you know anything about that Oh Uh-huh Yeah I would think so too It Uh-huh uh-huh Asylum of some sort Uh-huh Well Well I teach in the suburb of Dallas and my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas with very very good school systems And they're considered you know one of the top three in the state Both of them you know And it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools And they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here And the kids in this area are very bright And come from you know parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and very interested in their education But I think in the last year if I'm not mistaken in four of the six high schools the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were half or more Oriental And you know they're just extremely bright kids And also they value learning Well I think things come easy for them too But I do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States they don't want to work for anything They want it to come to them and be there but they don't want to work hard And these kids work really hard and they have Yeah I know I agree with that But what I see is y- the competition is there but instead of meeting the challenge they're starting to resent them And it's causing you know I think some problems It really is Because we see a lot of racial problems in the Dallas area anyway especially in Dallas And it's mainly Black and Hispanic But there has been some resentment with Orientals in the Black community because they've started businesses there and the Blacks resent them coming in and taking their money and there's been some violence because of it It is it is very sad So you know I really I've always prided myself on not being prejudiced and you know welcoming everyone that wants to come here And even when I was younger when I was in college I was a member of the N A A C P because I lived up north and I was very into the human rights part of everything But I've become very cynical in the last three four years living in Texas Uh-huh uh-huh Well and exactly that's exactly true Plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time Two two three four maybe five years and then go back And pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them and plus a lot of American dollars But in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too You know you just don't know An- and yet you know with <> there's somebody on my other line but I'm going to ignore that anyway I just you really don't know what to do and I don't I want my kids to have values where they're accepting and so forth And both of my children are really more tolerant of Blacks and Hispanics than they are of the Orientals for some reason They feel you know like they've taken over They feel like you know they're taking some of the rewards that they should have And I really don't want that to happen but it's happening And I think a lot of their friends feel the same way too and I really do wish I knew about quotas and really wish I <> <> I really do wish I knew more about immigration laws because I have no idea any more Because they've changed a great deal Yeah I don't really either I wish I knew more Probably if I did I might be a little bit more tolerant perhaps And I and even if I really wish I knew the situations they were going back to or coming from You don't know any of that and you feel you know you can't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them Unless and for some reason Orientals are very my good friend calls them pushy but I call them very that they know what they want and they go get it And in stores and so forth it's wh- pardon me Yeah But in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they get in front of you or they take something that you had in mind to get before you did You know just going for it they take it quickly And they don't think anything of that And I don't you know that's makes people resentful too And yet they have a right to be here and I know that But sometimes it's gets touchy and I'm sure it's a lot different you're from Maryland You said What part of Maryland are you from okay My sister used to live there in that area And I'm sure that it's a lot different there it's a lot different in Iowa than it is here Is that right Uh-huh Well you know since I teach I see it and I feel and I love the example that most of these children give our American children And yet you know I can see why some of the parents are fearful too and it's a kind of a touchy situation And I wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened But it doesn't happen that way all the time So anyway It was good to talk to you too And have a good trip in California All right Well thank you Bye-bye
