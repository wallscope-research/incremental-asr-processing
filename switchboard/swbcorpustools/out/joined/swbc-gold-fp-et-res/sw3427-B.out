more than likely it's going to be a Chrysler Chrysler LeBaron yeah It won't be a Ford I've got a Ford Mustang now and I hate it Yeah It's a eighty-eight It's I've had one problem with it after the other the paints peeling off of it and there's no reason for it you know  Should end in a slash not continue over to B14 which is a response to A13  Fix or repair daily  Should be an indep slash unit--is an answer to A13 and not related to B12 utt2  or find them road dead That I it's my electrical system shorted out like two or three times and it's been torn up since April and luckily everything was under warranty so it's only costing like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed It would have been like two thousand those are nice cars the gas mileage for one thing and I've always had like stick shift the next car I get I want it to be automatic I hate driving anyway and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now Yeah And you know when you work nine to five or eight to five and you're in rush hour traffic to and from work unfortunately And I look and one of the things with Chrysler right now is the warranties that they have and I feel like their everybody I've talked to that owns one has been real pleased with it and I like the driver's air bag I like that yeah well all Chrysler products has it in there but LeBaron would be the next car I get yeah Yeah yeah I like that too but I couldn't afford the insurance on one of those Yeah Well that's what I'm paying on mine now I had to get like a first time my dad's always cosigned on my loans or whatever and this is one when I bought I got my Mustang this time by myself because I got on my own or whatever and I had said they said it had to be like a first time buyer's car or whatever and they're charging me unreasonable interest but I've got eight more payments and it's paid for But I got it when the eighty-eights first came out it's a good car I got in eighty-seven I guess in like November or something like that and Uh-huh Well that's another big factor of mine next car I get's going to be a four door too Something with some room Because my Mustang is two door with bucket seats and you buy groceries and stuff like that
