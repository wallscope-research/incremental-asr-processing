Okay well some of the books I've read lately have to do with crafty type things where I've learned things that I'm going to do for my children for Christmas and they were really helpful because I didn't know how to do this one stitching and so that was very helpful to me as far as books Otherwise I like to read children's books and things like that What about you Oh  Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh It's interesting that you said that My husband and I had took a book out of the library about gardening too and started a garden a fall garden  Yeah and our cantaloupes and peppers and tomatoes are on right now so it's been really fun and we learned that you know some of the gardening skills we had were before but some of them we learned from a book and so that was helpful to us Now I've read two books that were nonfiction lately and I well one was nonfiction and one was fiction and the fiction one was about a boy during the time of Adolf Hitler and he grew up and lived through a concentration camp and that was not enjoyment that was too realistic and really a real eye opener and I guess it's good to read those things too but I didn't enjoy it necessarily and the other one was quite enjoyable It was about a Chinese lady and her generations down what happened to her family through the years so that one was good I think all of well even if they're not enjoyable they bring you some kind of learning so even if it's the country that they're from or anything like that So I like to read the children's books I think that's the most animated and imaginative So I like those a lot there are a couple of Newberry Award winners A WRINKLE IN TIME is one I don't know if you've ever read that but there's one about an Indian girl and I can't think of that ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS is another and that's a good one Now some of the ones that have just received the awards this year I haven't read and I would like to read those but it's funny because I've read some from like nineteen twenty-three and nineteen forty-five and things like that and I didn't enjoy those as much and I don't know if it's just because they didn't come from my era or what but Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh No even that's good Uh-huh Yeah my children and I started a thing where I read a book with them before they went to bed at night And there was one called THE PIG PRINCESS and it was a princess from a long long time ago and she came through a spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig sty and the people that she came to were just farm people and she didn't understand them and they didn't understand her but it came together in this book and it was really a lot of fun
