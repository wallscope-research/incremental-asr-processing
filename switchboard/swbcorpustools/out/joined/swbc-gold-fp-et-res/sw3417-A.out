Yes I guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years despite tax cuts but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in the world and in of the matter you get what you pay for if we're going to have national health insurance which seems likely it's necessarily going to involve more taxes I take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes that's the direction we should look Where's it all going Well one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into a big trust fund but that is a particularly regressive tax it's a tax on the first dollar earnings and Senator Moynihan's proposal to cut there I think makes a lot of sense I think Senator Moynihan's proposal to cut the social security tax which isn't really going to beef up the social security program could make a lot of sense Uh-huh yeah I think Japan is probably about equal to ours and other major countries are higher Our friends were amazed that the cost of things when they went to Canada not so long ago And as a whole most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services and it's a real they're real trade-offs there I that's a scary thing that there's no real knowing about there's a lot of inflation risk that isn't taken care of in most private pension plans No I'm at the National Institute of Standards and Technology part of the Commerce Department Here in Gaithersburg Maryland Well well I didn't pick it like I don't really recall I may have filled out on the form but I certainly have the feeling I've been given topics different from the ones that I mentioned before Yes yes when you place a call topic is given to you you should try it many of the subjects are taxes especially one thing that has kept our tax burden high and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the level of the defense budget and that same subject
