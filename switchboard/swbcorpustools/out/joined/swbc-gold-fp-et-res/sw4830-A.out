You want to go first Okay one of the things they talked about was what do we think about a judge making the decision And I really don't agree with that I think that the trial by jury is better you know having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible I don't think that they could be objective in every case every time you know what I mean Yeah Right That's it Well I feel the other thing too they were saying you know what new ways could it you know change the system I really think that we spend a lot of time going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed If they have been caught you know point blank in the crime There's no question it's beyond a reasonable doubt You know all these things you know we've gone through this over and over again And it can go on for ten twenty years I think this is a little ridiculous I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers I'm serious And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the criminal system today With plea bargaining You know if someone is ill Well Well I know That's what I'm saying But I think all of the whole criminal system is messed up in that regard you know people who commit crimes that they I don't know how it works exactly but you know they get lesser sentences and I understand that the jails are full of people you know and that they have to do something But I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it you know what I'm saying That well a lot of states don't have capital punishment And I think they should and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say there's no doubt whatsoever Like drunk drivers that kill people and you know all they're caught dead to rights I just think that they've taken a life and they should pay for it with their life Yeah Uh-huh Oh really It Yeah I know that Uh-huh And I don't know what would you do to change it To make it better yeah I don't agree with that at all Imagine the guilt that person would have burned out there's no possible way that you could you know feel good about yourself If you had to do something like that day after day No Not really Well do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you In other words you're saying that you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were Yeah Yeah Well I
