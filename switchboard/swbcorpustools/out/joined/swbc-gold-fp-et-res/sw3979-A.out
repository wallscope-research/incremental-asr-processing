Afternoon Doug it certainly is going to be a pleasure to chat with you And I'm certainly was surprised to hear from you Normally I talk to people in Plano Texas How did you get on this list Well okay All right Well now what would you say about these everyday invasions of our privacy What ideas do you have on that Doug In what manner Uh-huh Well the thing that I thought they were concerned about was people calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something and in reality in many cases they knew or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations And I thought was beginning to invade the privacy of people because the things about where you live and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business and they in return come back and try to sell you something with this additional knowledge To me that's an invasion of privacy Uh-huh You mean your history in regards to the charge card company or something like that Do you consider these serious problems Uh-huh Well what should we do about it or what could be done about it do you think to correct it Well I would think that information held on records by any company or charge card dealer or person should be absolutely private and not be allowed to be given out by those companies it should be made a national or a state law to protect people so that you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies In other words if you call the company yourself directly and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else you know from the outside so to speak then you would feel more free to go into detail with them but we have no control of that now and then when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you feel that it someday might be used against you
