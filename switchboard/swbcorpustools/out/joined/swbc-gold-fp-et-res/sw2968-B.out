got fantastic pictures in those things Uh-huh Yeah yeah You know I have not of course was it all books and things or was it any did it say anything about newspapers I have forgotten what the question was exactly But what do you read I guess in general Or Yeah I glance at all newspapers I do like since the re- since the economy is doing so bad I never have read the financial pages more often than now you know And trying to analyze and look for some good news in in there you know to see if the Well I have only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything I thought well see if there is anything in there that would be positive you know You always look for things with this terrible recession that we are in to see if there is any go- yeah yeah It is hopefully we will recover here Yeah Yeah Right and he yeah I know I do not really know if any one person knows what some of the problems are but there are some interesting things in the paper really Yeah It Yeah No I glance at it I with the so much {F uh } you sound like you have a family too But with a family and everything there is just so much going on that actually I am more of a r- not more of a radio buff

girlfriend he is well into his forties and I guess he got a young girlfriend who and then every time you take you are that rich you just get in the news immediately you know which is tough Well that and his business is going down the tubes so bad you know He was essentially like you said a tycoon Donald Trump had it all He was high roller for about ten years and then he is now essentially bankrupt you know And so h- Yeah Yeah No right who knows what he has really got But he was kind of an arrogant guy so I think the newsmen enjoyed writing about him on his way down you know And his wife seemed to be very smart And actually running some of his business she was actually somewhat of a business partner of his did very well Ivana Trump yeah they have been on all the news and everything in the papers and on Barbara Walters and everything else  yeah I can imagine Right yeah I know what you mean really Okay Yeah well hang in there And good luck with those kids Right Bye-bye
