That's a tough question We are now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework Right Don't ask me Well it has no credibility any more Well I'm a school teacher and I'm in charge of raising them so I can appreciate it good for you good for you Well you know it's interesting because when I heard the topic I was thinking this summer Oprah had a T V show about wives that refused to go to work and how their husbands thought they were terrible and one woman had four children and her husband said she wasn't pulling her own weight in the family that's frightening and you know it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue you know people were siding with the husband saying You've got to go to work if you have these four children you've got to support them and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them That's true That's true Yeah well you know as I said I teach school and gosh I'm trying to think I don't know I have one mother that I know is home but she also has ten children Six seven and eight In Richardson okay yeah I've got one child that stays with me every day until five because his mother doesn't come home until seven and he doesn't want to be home from three thirty until seven by himself Uh-huh Well he stays with me and I have a tendency to work late I work until six so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home and you know I have lots of kids because they know I'm there late I'm a slow mover to say the least but they'll come in and say Can I stay with you because I don't want to go home to an empty house And that's frightening because you know the when I said I'm raising them I am because we're talking about boy friends and we're talking about what the girl said in class and you know what's right because there's no mother at home and it makes a difference I and just the social values I don't know I have a feeling we're going to go more and more I've got a twenty-one year old female and I've got twenty-two year old male children and I listen to my daughter and she's going to work and she's going to buy her house and she's going to get her car and then she's going to have her children and then when you know they go on one salary will they be able to sustain what their life-style is And they're back to work and you know I agree with you I was raised in a generation we didn't need all those things and we lived without them we did fine
