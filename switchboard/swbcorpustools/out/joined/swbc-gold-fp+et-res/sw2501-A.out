Okay we're energized painting interesting the guy called me when she called me the computer called me I thought that they were reading my mind I'm in the middle of going out for bids to have my house painted painting is not hard to do as long as it's not to the point of where it needs to be scraped and peeling and our house is not but it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap and it's just a hassle to go through it so I'm looking for the easy way out It's easier to find painters but you have to be aware of how messy they can get and are they going to put on a good two coats and are they going to caulk Exterior Yeah interior's not so bad because it's more fun it's more c- but yeah outside you have high peeks and those kind of things it can be a real issue Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Here they some of the home builders are they don't put brick on the side of your house just to save money so they put up a quarter inch Masonite basically and they painted it kind of like a spun of a sorts so it's real cheap And I've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and as low as five hundred and forty dollars so it's just a matter of it's there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap and I'm so much worried about that as what I don't want it all over the brick and windows and sure So y'all you haven't had any jobs painted in your house recently That's fun Uh-huh Uh-huh that's not very they just painted over varnished wood my  Uh-huh Sure no  I wish you good luck Thank you very much Bye-bye
