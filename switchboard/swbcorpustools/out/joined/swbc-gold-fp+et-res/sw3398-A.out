Hi My name is Donna Donahue and I live in Plano Texas okay do you want to start or should I start Okay I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in We have three children and they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports soccer and baseball and well my little girl goes to tap dance and my little one goes to preschool and I'm home with the children just do a lot of running around It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type I don't know life what about you Uh-huh Uh-huh Okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Was sort of maintenance free Yeah Oh yeah well that sounds pretty good for I know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends not so much now but to maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds and it's a lot of work owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it It's sometimes I think it would be nice to have a town home with not having all that responsibility Right that sounds lovely Uh-huh Uh-huh So in your area then there's probably a lot of career type people that have those type homes and uh-huh and the area that we're settled in is definitely young families with kids They're still doing a lot of building in the neighborhood So the people that move here seem to move from all over the country which we're from the northeast and seems like a people or also don't have any family around So it also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors you know But Uh-huh Right right Uh-huh Now is it very wooded around where you are there lots of pretty trees and Yeah how pretty I do miss that Around here in Plano there are very few trees and it's pretty flat and kind of barren and that's the only thing that we don't like about living in Texas is we miss all the beautiful trees and the Fall and the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is you know in the north or even where you are A lot of leaves to rake up too I bet Does that well see that's another plus That's right that's right they are I'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done We just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but not much just a little kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks and if you didn't do anything about it then they'd probably the leaves just blow away It's not too bad Okay do we have to speak for a certain amount of time Okay Okay It was really nice speaking to you Okay and have a happy Thanksgiving Bye-bye
