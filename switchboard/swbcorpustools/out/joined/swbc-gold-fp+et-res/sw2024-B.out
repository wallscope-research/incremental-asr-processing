Wonderful touch tone telephone there I have a wide variety of hobbies therefore my reading pleasures are quite wide I get a charge out of TEXAS HIGHWAY which is very colorful and not being a native of Texas but being here eleven years have a tendency to find out about the different areas of the state by reading it yeah absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can set up little trips and day trips and things It's pretty neat <> I like photography magazines I don't take a subscription or anything like that things being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of building magazines and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines and kind of strange because it's not unusual to see an engineering manual or something laying around the house and then I'll sit up and read just to refresh you know to keep active on it but How about yourself that's great Uh-huh I bet that would be rather interesting that's self improvement well that's kind of a hobby but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing well I hate to yes I do we have these classes we attend management classes and they give you books and the last book matter of fact I read was AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht It talks about who the customer is and being customer oriented which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer Your my customer I'm your customer sort of thing every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about better outlooks on things and the philosophy of Pat Hagerty and these kind of mind stimulating philosophy type Which all you know betters yourself Uh-huh Like what for example Sure Sure How about items like THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER which used to be a big okay So those are self improvements our supervisor subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW By a man named Doctor Bittel B I T T E L <> and it's a very layman's approach towards managing different types of people And the very last chapter {A and I haven't figured out why that one was last } is how to manage engineers So it's interesting here again it's casual reading and it's not eaten up with a lot of mechanical stuff and it's really excellent fast reading but as you say sometimes it's difficult to know if it's you know I think if somebody would say hey read these ten books because these are self-improvements I would probably be turned off to them If he casually just walked into it and put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested Yeah they're hard to set down because it's so interesting and of course they're all just a little spookier than the movies but they're always challenging to get through one of them I have a hard time finishing books Uh-huh In quality especially now days that's almost everything that comes across the airways exactly right Yeah I think we name drop it a little too much and don't fully understand what it is we're saying I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and all that kind of rolls in together there but that's just kind of part of it not that I can think of I think I'm under my quota a little bit I need to probably make a phone call or two this is true I've enjoyed it Have a good day Bye-bye
