I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than by evidence that's presented I have very little regard for the law presently practiced I was thinking primarily criminal cases Yes Uh-huh That's a concern of mine I would feel more comfortable in many cases I think with judges you know doing the sentencing Uh-huh Yeah my question I guess are they really your peers <> too often I think they are not and when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have you know that is a matter of concern to me too I think that in such cases they are not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased now I happen to know several judges and there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury I would feel a little bit uneasy about but the other two I feel would give either you know the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law And I guess that's what I am concerned with Uh-huh This is very true Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah and you do see such uneven sentencing you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such I mean where it would appear the crimes were very similar but one individual got twenty-five years and the other one was sentenced to life So  Isn't that the truth There are times when  is it + goodness my mind has gone blank it's  Othello You know where he says kill all the lawyers Every now and then one is tempted to see what But it's taken me a long time to understand that lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice you know as novices tend to think that attorneys care about justice Uh-huh And they are very effective too even I have been involved just slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty but his attorneys gotten him off the city has dropped their charges against him because the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge So I don't know
