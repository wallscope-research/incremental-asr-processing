Well one of the cars I'm thinking about buying next is a nice safe small car but the reason being is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have a big family and we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and so forth and we have another four door car that I drive to work and I think it'd be more economical if I were able to a smaller car and wouldn't cost much with gas what are you looking at Uh-huh yeah yes yes Well the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the  yes yes I really like the looks also of the new Mazda that they have but you know the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now Yes they do Uh-huh Right Well you can't go wrong with that kind of opportunity Yes Wow Well you get a much bigger better comfortable ride Yes Well that's fantastic That's real real good No do you Very comfortable smooth ride it does that's unbelievable for that size of car Yes Wow That's great That's great That kind of gas mileage we're kind of hoping for on our van Uh-huh Well that's excellent Uh-huh does it need a lot of repairs Is it a very reliable kind of car Yes Yes  dear dear Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes They charged you twenty-five dollars just to tell you that Uh-huh so they probably went through the I see Uh-huh okay And found it right away Uh-huh Yes Well I think that you have an excellent deal then and the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all so Yes No not at all
