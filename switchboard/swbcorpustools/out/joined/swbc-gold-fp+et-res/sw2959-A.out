no no My father came in right after World War two I am too young yeah yes A couple the one guy I worked with down in Austin hated it he was a lineman down there And while he was there he caught some kind of a strange disease And all his hair fell out and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while And I do not think he was in combat so Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Right Yeah But he was in the Navy though he was It makes a lot of difference Uh-huh Huh yeah Well the armed forces did so much to you know Agent Orange they did so much to their own people all during that time You know and even now they take a free hand as far as medicine and you know how they treat the war casualties you know If you come back and your leg is blown off you know or it is hanging by a thread they still can't put it back together now But what they do afterwards and how they rehabilitate you Uh-huh Yeah yeah it's about nine or ten percent now Uh-huh That's true No Uh-huh Yeah That is Uh-huh Well they are probably not doing very well at all Because I know there is still people even in the Dallas area there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from Vietnam   native Vietnamese people Yeah They were lost you know when they were little and they never did get back or Yeah and as is really a big waste because they didn't win they didn't regain any of the land that they had It spilled over into now I can't even think of the country But Yeah Cambodia And to Laos and all they did is run and hide And they were not really fighting you know it would have been the same as Desert Storm if all they had been fighting was North Vietnam But and I am not even sure who was involved more Whether it was China or Russia You know they were pouring weapons in there and well digging tunnels for them You know and there is no way that they could ever catch them Yeah that is right Uh-huh Yeah yeah all they can do is dig in and they you know and then they try to camouflage the top I think even now and in Vietnam they could probably have done a better job Because they could kill all those plants you know which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on But and the Corps of Engineers I think do a better job now like they did in Desert Storm Because they had he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil and he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went And you know they had to blow them up or disarm them And then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he had made those moats  W- yeah partially Uh-huh Yeah Part of it is technology yeah Because all go ahead Yeah I think that is one of the reasons they have pretty much avoided getting involved in South America Because look what happened when they were looking for Noriega and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him you know He probably just went right down into a tunnel Yeah That is right Uh-huh Yeah And they really need everybody that has stood there it's when i- in Vietnam I think it was much closer contact You stand there with a rifle and blow a piece of somebody apart or blow their head off and that has to affect you if you are human you know So they had to work all that anger out and the nightmares that come along with it I do not really think that anybody can ever forget that but they can reason and try to adjust to why they were there Right Uh-huh Right Yeah that was in the era when Kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything you know and they initially got into it because of Eisenhower And he did not want to be in it any more than what we started out in August with Desert Storm And then it just blew up into the war Uh-huh French yeah Uh-huh Right yeah Uh-huh Yeah Right Exactly Uh-huh Yeah More than what was APOCALYPSE NOW Yeah I think so Yes it was nice talking to you Okay bye-bye
