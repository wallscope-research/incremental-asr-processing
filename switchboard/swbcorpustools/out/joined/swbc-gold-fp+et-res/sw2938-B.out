we've got quite a few actually What we're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city we've actually had some warnings in Raleigh on air pollution Uh-huh because of there so many cars and we have a belt line around Raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic And you know it's just surrounding the city and you can actually see it There's a couple of tall buildings in Raleigh and you can actually you know they're blurred they're even dark and what it is is the pollution Well I guess that's the fluorocarbons and Uh-huh Yeah that's very serious I mean we're even feeling the effects of the weather from the shift in the jet stream yeah I mean the last two years our winters have been absolutely nothing I mean maybe one snow Kentucky North Carolina is all the way on the east coast It's further west than Georgia it's right below Virginia Uh-huh Uh-huh Originally I'm from Texas so I mean Amarillo So Uh-huh Yeah real close I've been out of Texas about ten years twenty seven I almost forgot my age really  Uh-huh Actually they've been doing the same thing here you know it's kind of funny I guess northerners are different but even North Carolinians they don't know how to handle cold weather Uh-huh That's true Do you all have much pollution there Uh-huh Well you know what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe Uh-huh Well supposedly that's supposed to catch it But I'll tell you what and even these buses lord it real bad These buses in Raleigh yeah I mean school buses are notorious yeah yeah Well you know what they've started doing is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top and that way it gets above other cars on the road and it really does make a difference although it settles you know even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out it still settles and you know if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road that's even more miserable I'd have to go out to the country to jog No I didn't know that Uh-huh  Uh-huh Golly that's bad I'm sure Well you can really feel it you know in your breathing even normal people and if you're older I mean you can really deplete your oxygen and it'll you know pass out and you know it's killed several people actually I just smoke one in the evening if that So I'm a very very light smoker It was kind of funny They were doing some ozone testing the E P A and they were just screening some candidates and I don't think I'd ever you know do that but they asked me if I was a smoker and I didn't fit into the smoker's category and I didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category you know I was just one of those yeah in between people So that kind of threw them off But they're doing a lot of research here the E P A For ozone and yeah all that they're real big into it They've got Research Triangle Park here and you know they're just doing a lot of stuff Huh-uh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh gosh I think I would hate to live in California the smog there I mean I can't believe they have warnings here which it's mainly just when it gets real real hot Really well that's kind of good to know because lord I thought I lived in a halfway decent area  Uh-huh Well you ought to come to North Carolina It's a big change Yeah There was no trees where I was from in Amarillo and here they've got the mountains the beach the trees you know they've got streams rivers ponds it's really pretty here Is it Uh-huh Sherman and Denison do you know my grandparents live in Durant Yeah Yeah real close I go there Yeah uh-huh Yeah we used to go fishing in Lake Texoma huh-uh really Well I'm going to have to get some Uh-huh Do you smoke Do you Did you smoke when you were pregnant Well I mean I can understand that actually Well Yeah Well one thing I miss is the people from Texas are you know I miss their morals their values and everything It's Uh-huh How'd you get involved in this research I see  I was taking a voice I O class and actually doing some research and so they told me about this project Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh no Boston's above Uh-huh Yeah I've talked to a lot of people in Texas I had one call actually from Charlotte North Carolina and Virginia and I can't remember where all From up north like you said I think one was from Boston Uh-huh Uh-huh I bet you're glad Uh-huh gosh
