Okay I'll let you start Do you all keep a budget and how do you hold to yours Well that's good Especially for these times Uh-huh Well that's a lot of it I know we tried several different ways One time we tried something that really worked but we didn't keep it up I passed it on to a friend and she won't quit doing it She loves it and that was the envelope system Where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that So you have one for entertainment and one for groceries et cetera And then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form causes you to realize how much is left And she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what she's buying And then at the end of the pay period if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment And they kind of work it that way We tried for a while and a seems like the problem that they were having of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about And those are the ones that will kill you You know the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month Uh-huh That's what I mean It was a hassle Uh-huh Uh-huh that's kind of hard But do you sort of self budget even I mean you wouldn't like on payday think boy I can go do this and that and this and that You kind of think this is got to str- you kind of divide it in fourths in a way don't you Right Right Well that's true What we're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely And we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month Oh Yeah we're not there yet Uh-huh Uh-huh That's right That's right  Uh-huh same here Uh-huh Well I could say it's kind of you know that's good you probably have a little extra than you have to have to you know what I'm saying And so that's the difference there where sometimes like I know if we've had an especially bad month and we're just almost getting down to payday then I think if we could really budget we tried one tim- I know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadn't had a car payment in five years we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was going to be left and that was a real eye opener slash error Uh-huh slash error should be 'b' But to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes I'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out So it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're going to spend going out for fun This is how much you're going to spend <> It's kind of hard Do you Yeah yeah Right Right Oh How nice Uh-huh W- Well that's and it made a big and you enjoyed it better probably Yeah I think so too So if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you that's excellent That's what I'm working toward I think you're probably much ahead of me there and I'm working on it Same here same here And I think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get You know Yeah That came up Yeah Uh-huh Well that's the best thing to do My husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasn't worth it from the day after So Rather frugal Well that's going to payoff on retirement Yeah Well it I guess we've completed do you think we've been here to in-
