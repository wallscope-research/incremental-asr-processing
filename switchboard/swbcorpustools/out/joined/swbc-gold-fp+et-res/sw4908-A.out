around here we have a program where  we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers And we keep the newspapers in a they're collected twice a month and the trash and this bottled stuff that is put in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck So they actually have about three passes at this collection One for the regular trash one for the you know the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers No they do that on the truck They separate them as they you know dump them And you know one guy comes around with his truck and dumps it all in there And I think they're running out of you know The sanitary landfill I think is you know running out Of course you being from New Mexico you've probably been to Washington Especially if you're your present location You must have come to Washington at least once My you've got a lot of nothing out there You know they got I mean there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about that you could use for landfill Well  what other +   we- what  + what  unique  things you think that you can do about it in Los Alamos other than nuking it This really should be the continuation "+" of A16 since it's not a clause or an answer to a question  Well that's pretty upscale trash situation I don't think anybody around here would understand all those exotic techniques you know getting rid of the heavy metals  We-  Well that's certainly you know getting into the swim of things I think it should go to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away you know but more than that every week you've got to pay by the pound I think you know they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Well of course you know those big trucks probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor
