All right I guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force Few are basically staying home and being homemakers and raising kids exclusively Uh-huh Yeah true Well mine taught kindergarten but she was always I guess her schedule was shorter so she was always home yeah Yeah that statistic I guess has been growing every year it's like something around sixty sixty-five percent or so now I'm not sure what the future holds for that whether Uh-huh  That's unusual Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah that is tough Yeah we're looking at that now my wife's about six months along Uh-huh True Yeah I'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home I would think it would be women that were working full-time  Uh-huh Well I guess that's good that they've got something to keep them active Yeah we're going to try and have her stay home for as long as possible <> What do you think Yeah we think it's that important and I kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction I'm a counselor and a therapist and I work with adolescents and I see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure Uh-huh Uh-huh True Well the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too So kids are raised around their friends and by the media And you know that's contributed Yeah maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time so If there was some way for women to stay home even if they could work you know there are a lot of jobs that are coming about like in computers at home and those types of things that would at least in some ways bridge the gap <> About The balance I don't the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so and it got higher than that for a while that's hard to say Families are such a strange configuration anymore I see a lot of families where you know in the back I grew up about the same time you did and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible nowadays it's not the case kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk and one of the reasons I guess is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working They get bombarded with junk and they don't have to do anything around the house They never learned to be responsible when the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while and they come back and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad so you know you create a bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose So It's not a real functional situation anyway So you know I don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families and the families as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society Uh-huh Yeah it is I guess unless there's a major swing in the change of what's important to people you know probably keep going downhill And I I don't know we feel that we can make it on one income it may be tough but we may have to give up on some things Yeah Yeah I think so too Okay Well I've enjoyed it Stephanie Uh-huh Bye-bye
