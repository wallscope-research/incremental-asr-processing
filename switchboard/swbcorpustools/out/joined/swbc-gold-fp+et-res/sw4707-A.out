I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon Are you eating No it's Say what Tell you what we can do is I can punch the one and then after five minutes when the voice comes on we can talk all night if we want I love the irony of talking about this subject on April the fifteenth But I'm afraid I'm probably in the minority I actually don't think that we pay too much in this country particularly in this part of the country w- I guess I do have a bone to pick with the way taxes are distributed I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form and the sales tax can't I think that's regressive and it's kind of dumb Well I mean nobody taxes groceries Where Is that right Right Right But I guess when I see the comparison between the United States and any other western country their rates are like forty-one forty-two and ours are like thirty-six thirty-seven you know if you compute as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well there's no other country that is taxed as low as we are Yeah Uh-huh I'm not sure I understand what you mean Right you mean lowest end of living in spite of higher taxes Yeah I suppose that's true yeah probably less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever but Yeah Right Right Right Yeah Yeah since I send my kids to parochial school that it's not quite the bargain that But I mean I pay them gladly That's a decision I think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools with the same tax money But I mean that's the way Americans want to interpret it I guess that's all right But yeah I and if I were when I was single and again when I'm retired I will not mind paying what it takes to keep the schools good That's always been a high priority I do yeah that's true I think in places like California people are beginning to find that in areas that are fairly well off if you add the people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are just looking for fun people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens And there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done That seems like a cultural lapse I mean people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools They Right Yeah People would rather increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them But I think it's sad selfish and shortsighted Yeah Well
