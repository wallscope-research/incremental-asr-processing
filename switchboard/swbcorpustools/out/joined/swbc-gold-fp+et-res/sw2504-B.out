Okay Well do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote  Uh-huh Well Well there's no question it does make a difference so far as having a party and then all voting when you have different precincts you would have to have a party in every precinct Because people have to vote in different areas and not everyone votes at the same place I personally think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up with the idea of the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference But Absolutely Absolutely and they are doing that in a number of schools However probably not enough of them country wide But it's going to take at least a whole generation of people to get across the idea of voting just like it's taking a whole generation of people to finally realize the harmfulness of drugs and hopefully now with the many programs throughout the country on how to resist taking drugs How to say no to it and what have you That perhaps we'll finally get the youth weaned off of it But I know I spent thirty-four years in education here in the Dayton area and in nineteen fifty-one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana giving away their heroin <> and what have you to get them started And you know that was in fifty-one That's forty years ago that it was already a problem So it's now to the forefront and people are finally taking some action against it And the thing we've neglected the value of voting and what it really means to vote and we also don't make the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them Uh-huh Sure Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Right Uh-huh Right To complain about it right Right That's right That's right Tha- Yes Uh-huh Yeah I it's the same way with everything in education though It should begin right down in the first grade and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first second or third grade So that the children develop good learning patterns and you have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning and not wait until they're in high school and then it's too late to try to change them around at that point But everything should be started on the lower levels and certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that you know they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant but you're right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians And perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run that only the most wealthy can do so And they're not always the best person for the job But they have the money to be able to do it so there are a lot of problems along that line also And perhaps the Government Sure Right Uh-huh Yes Right That's right And I think you know that's an excellent idea They would put them to realize that their going to have to do what someone else says even though they didn't vote for it And that maybe they need to think twice about voting Now some people object during primaries having to declare a party whether Republican or Democrat and you do that in the primary and I don't know that a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason they can declare anything they want and they can actually rig it If they really wanted to vote Republican they could go in the primary and say they were voting Democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat But it's just a sad situation and I do think more needs to be done along that line to help to teach the everyone more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting So that they're making some more intelligent decisions And it's going to take these young you know it's going to take a whole generation of my feeling before that's going to be accomplished That's right Uh-huh Yeah Right Uh-huh Sure Right Well sure it is Uh-huh Well just the opportunity to try the voting machines yeah Right Yes Uh-huh Good Yeah Sure it is Absolutely
