All right Well what kind of car would I want to buy I don't know The question is I mean would I want to buy or would I probably actually buy May be two different things If I had all the money I wanted then that's whole different matter No in that case I don't know my dream car for years was a Porsche Turbo But I don't know if I'd want one of those now Of course I would want one if somebody was given to me But I maybe would buy a B M W or even a Volvo I've got a Dodge Daytona It's actually the first car we ever bought new Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah me too So what car do you drive What is it Uh-huh we almost bought one of those Do you like it Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah you get a little more control over when it's doing the things it's doing Yeah what rental agent did you go to to rent those kind of cars To what AVIS Really Huh I guess I see Uh-huh Right You work for a big company then T I I see Uh-huh but yeah I don't know I would probably if I were to buy a car you know with the constraints of real money I probably would go with something you know like a Honda Accord Maybe it would one thing I really liked about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have this seven year warranty and it really saved us some big money once Yeah they had a whole bunch of things that sort of broke at the same time and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars and I had to pay twenty five for the Yeah it was Well we bought the extension and at the time we bought it it was like you know I don't know four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra Yeah we did but you know we really debated at the beginning and of course I'm glad I did it But we still have like you know three years left on it no Bumper Oh Well that was good Are you Uh-huh if you were going to buy a new car would you buy another Accord Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah those are nice Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah my sister drives one She drives a I don't know is it Legend it's a I'm not certain but she's liked it But I have never had and we in fact what I'm driving right now we only had one car for a long time and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth four miles to work and back kind of thing And so I bought a used Yugo just to be a you know little car that I could care less about well it's worked I mean that's exactly what it is you know it's a cheap little car just to go you know run around town in and It's actually kind of fun to drive I you know getting back in the Daytona now I almost don't like it You know it's like too mushy and you know it's an automatic and it's too the steering you know you feel like you're in a boat or something you know it's kind of Oh
