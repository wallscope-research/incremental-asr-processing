Yeah I might as well one of the things I'm very concerned about the air pollution is the ozone layer issue I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of different types of freons and that rather bothers me that I was in effect contributing to the delinquency of the environment so to speak Right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in that area was because they were inexpensive they could be made you know inexpensive and lots of it and in that its properties were great with the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to get your heating and cooling cycles to work So Well course there's a tremendous number of excuse me refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential utilizing freon twelve and of course the new cars I guess starting with nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems But there's you know the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera And that's got me very you know highly concerned that that's going to be quite a while before we can undo this Now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion so I see us in somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless the banks or industry and the government go together and come up with a way to have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting compound Because as I say there's a tremen- well how many families own a refrigerator and then do you know that number how many a freezer separate from and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning I mean there are people that have a thriving business that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on automobiles and trucks and the only reason I didn't get into that more when I had my little business was because most of your air conditioning on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree and I mean so that's why I stayed more towards and that's a polluting type deal too is the excessive you know petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with water <> really make a mess Uh-huh Right Well most of the time when you see you know the busses with the diesel those are carbon particles and carbon dioxide and water vapor because when diesel is burned it's it you know diesel fuel is burned in the diesel engine it's burned so completely that you don't have any nitrous oxides or oxides of nitrogen to form by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil is not very volatile You know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone Diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily and it's got well you know it's latent heat is high but it's slow burning at normal pressures That's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio and so if the car sucks in fifty degrees
