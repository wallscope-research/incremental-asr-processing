pretty good actually I work for Hewlett Packard and they have a pretty good benefits package In fact they're kind of known for having good benefits The pay isn't fabulous although I saw a survey recently and you know I'm making actually over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me I've got a Bachelor's in electrical engineering so And I'm not like a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff anyway our benefits are pretty good We've got stock purchase program and a that's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is kind of a pain but there's a four O one K plan for sheltering some taxable income there's I've been with them for seven years Yeah And and a lot of the stuff the best thing is like four years or five years it's pretty soon you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything so it's not t- but there's several medical plans to choose from that cover pretty much everything I don't get sick that often so I don't pay much of it and I pay five dollars every time I visit the hospital you know for a checkup or whatever they don't cover eyes though and I have contact lenses so that's kind of a pain But you know I can live yeah yeah Right And Yeah yeah and the dental plan is fabulous The dental plan I pay absolutely nothing because I guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that but that's not the case so I guess nothing It's fabulous the what about you Uh-huh  Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah one of the things with my company is that they've got a reputation for a lot of job security and there's a lot of different things that they do lot of different divisions in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do so there's I myself have moved around quite a bit within the company and I haven't had to move my residence to do that You know I still live in San Jose and Yeah it yeah Yeah Uh-huh Right right Uh-huh Yeah yeah In fact I know a guy who works at Andover who I used to work with out here and he moved his family back east a few years ago to take that position Kind of interesting anyhow
