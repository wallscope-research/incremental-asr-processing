Uh-huh Yeah that's probably a major one I think individually just by the vast number of people there are I think cars are also a major contributor to it Yeah vehicles <> Huh Uh-huh uh-huh <> Just a minute I'm on the phone Uh-huh Yeah Well it Yes I have five in the kitchen at the moment <> You need to shut the door please Shut the door right now We have the air conditioner running What do you need Hurry I'm on the phone Yes you may And they keep turning the tape recorder up besides I have three of my own and I have two that I'm tending for the summer Off and on so They cause more noise pollution than air pollution That's right that's right Yeah But I think another you can tell when you go around cities you can smell specific things from specific industries I remember being I grew up in New Jersey and I can remember the smell of Newark vividly And it's the type of industry you know which obviously if you can smell it it's in the air Yeah Well people think you burn it it's gone but it's not gone Uh-huh Then it just gets into the soil and into the water Yeah Yeah We really have to do more I think we've got to do more with the recycling That's I'm really glad to see that there's more of that happening Yeah Well it's a we're getting at least they're starting you know So at least they're moving that direction Yeah Uh-huh Well it's probably going to be a generation or two before it's really going very well because now the adults are more aware of it and the children are being taught in the schools it'll be you know on down the road this is going to be passed on which is good Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I think you're right education is a big thing you know and as we educate them individually what they can do people become more aware of the things in industry too that are causing problems and I think that they'll work towards solving those problems more too Uh-huh Yeah <> Just a minute and I'll turn it up I'll turn it up in a minute honey when I'm done Uh-huh Yeah Well I think science has come a long way to making it so that it's possible to find ways to solve the problem  I think they teach it a lot in science Yeah I would think that that's where it would come through I think they're kind of getting it in all different grades Yeah I think they are starting probably in the first grade you know they're hearing somewhat about it I know Target has their program to make kids more aware of it and Yeah if you go in the entrance they've got stands usually where they have kind of a little newspaper thing that the kids can read and they can form a group to Yeah yeah So Yeah Well I know it's a hard problem to solve because you know like McDonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more and then there's the paper and plastic bag question
