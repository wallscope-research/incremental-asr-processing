Well I usually keep up with news by watching A B C news on television and reading the papers here the local DALLAS MORNING NEWS and then I also take the WALL STREET JOURNAL Yeah well I at the office I generally catch the WALL STREET JOURNAL at lunchtime I use part of my lunch period to read the WALL STREET JOURNAL Then I read the the newspaper at home generally in the evening I'd rather sleep the extra thirty minutes in the morning Yeah Yeah that's what we do to we're never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television so we catch the ten o'clock news But I catch the news on the radio coming to and from work but radio news is rather short most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour And if you catch the news stations you don't catch that much in the car Yeah but Yeah I have the same situation I tried the news magazines like TIME NEWSWEEK U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT and they'd just stack up I wouldn't find time to read them You have to have time to sit down and concentrate on the stories or all of a sudden you look and there's three weeks worth laying on the coffee table and you wind up throwing them out without reading them Because it's too much trouble to try and catch up so have to depend I guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that I don't think that my children even read newspapers other than the T V guide section There's is all strictly television news yeah Yeah Right it's the same thing with the news magazines like TIME and the other magazines It's hard to separate the news from the comment because in the way it's presented their opinions is print or presented as being the news And so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news That's right Right Well so many of them also come through and they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time Whether it be the homeless or cancer or whatever and then they devote an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind And particularly the local television I know the the Wednesday's Child bit and they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something I'm not saying that's not important but they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects Yeah s- yeah that makes sense We again like I say by the time I read the newspaper it's that morning's news from the day before and I'm reading it in the evening so I'm about a day behind most of the time anyway Yeah Yeah Yeah we Yeah yeah my wife and I feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own It's always there's something going on all the time you don't really have time to sit down and thoroughly read a newspaper As a matter of fact I read the Sunday paper this evening We had such a busy day yesterday Didn't find time to even read it Yeah well that's about all then Nice talking with you Same to you Bye
