Well Stephanie what's your position on gun control Uh-huh Now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles Really And that didn't help at all  Uh-huh I usually just I'm trying to think of I guess I would tend myself to be more towards the like three where I don't think you should necessarily ban guns by any means but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature you know you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one you know right off the shelf but Uh-huh exactly And so I think that kind of control would be good but the you know I'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement just to kind of exam it a little bit and I know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true only the guns were in the hands of the criminals but how many times I guess I have never heard of a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun And maybe they just don't report those or I'm not sure or you know I can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed but good thing they had their gun on them and they thwarted the robbery attempt Uh-huh Uh-huh True were you brought up in a family that hunted or How about that  Uh-huh jeez Right Uh-huh Right I've also always thought about the idea you know most sports you know which are the N R A and people have their thing you know if you ban guns you're just banning the recreation the sport of hunting things of that nature Most of that's done with rifles and such though there's you know probably I'm sure some sector that does it with handguns But just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous you couldn't be inconspicuous when you walked into a store stuff like that you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately you know if they had to have a rifle or was you know made it more difficult to get a handgun Now of course you know in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want But I guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and you know temporarily a little bit offset or off keel I don't know if that's a large percentage of crime or not but I guess it would be some But I think definitely like today they just introduced what's called the Brady bill The seven day mandatory waiting period on getting any guns And I think Shoot that's a good idea sure Uh-huh Right Yeah that's crazy Yeah that's kind of wild Uh-huh That is kind of wild Well that's all very interesting Well thanks for talking Good-bye
