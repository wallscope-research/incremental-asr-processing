Okay Well I used to work in a day care center I worked in all the different areas of the day care center and they can be deceiving to people I did not work there long because I couldn't handle the treatment that the children got and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three centers all over you know the city and they would be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left So I think you know if you do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks to check in on them when they're not expecting it Because they do things differently when you're not around so Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Well this one was set up good I mean they had two teachers to every room sometimes three And they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool The problem I had was that they did not show affection to the children enough They did not show them care to these small children who are being left they one time I picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other You know he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up And I said no this child was crying and needed some comfort you know what is your problem So Yes Right they had like the babies that didn't walk in one room The ones that were starting to walk in one room Then they had like the three year olds upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives You know just like that You know they really did separate them well It was just the teachers themselves Right But yeah that they're not Yeah Their system Right but their system was great but you know the caring just wasn't there The one woman that did the babies I worked with her and she was fabulous She loved them babies and she loved them and cared for them But every one of the others that I saw was just screaming and yelling and you know would make me a nervous wreck so you know Yeah these kids are just in a day care center all day and with any type of emotional you know getting care they're just there You know Going through this routine which is lousy Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah you don't see that much That's cute Yeah that has to be with a day care center I've never heard of that that's a new one on me Uh-huh
