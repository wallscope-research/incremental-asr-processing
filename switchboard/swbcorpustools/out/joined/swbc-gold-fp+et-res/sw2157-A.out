Okay Who do you think The Dallas Cowboys Yeah Uh-huh Yeah they're going to get better I mean you know Yeah As long as Troy Aikman doesn't get hurt again That kind of killed them at the end of the season last year So I don't even know who your favorite team is actually Okay I think I did know that I just forgot Okay Yeah Has Herschel Walker done much for them Definitely Well he was a good player I guess well I don't know he just never I don't know for a while there Well you know he'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone But I guess you never could really see him play because with the Cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team and I always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team But I don't know Emmett Smith yeah N- he's been doing real good I'm pretty impressed with him so far did he actually play in the Pro Bowl I remember he was like a backup and then somebody got injured and he was supposed to go Yeah I haven't been keeping up with football I mean in the fall I can go on and on about football but since it's kind of off season it's kind of hard to think back about all that But <> Yeah I have no idea No earthly idea How did they end up this year did they make it to the play-offs at all Uh-huh Kind of like the cowboys Except I think the Cowboys are on the upswing I don't know about the Vikings Just hadn't heard much about them lately Yeah Well the Cardinals I don't know I think the Cowboys probably have a better team They just at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt because Laufenberg just couldn't ever really get it together at all Of course he sat along the sidelines all season he never really got in a game never did a whole lot Well I'm just saying I shouldn't blast him like that say well Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them I mean he didn't get to see much action But too bad Because now you know he had a shot and didn't look too good and so no one's going to have much faith in him any more In fact I think they're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback I haven't kept up with it lately but I remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody but it wasn't anybody I'd really heard of But I heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that Aikman's back in practicing doing real real well who is it Michael Irvin he said that Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time So sounds like he's going to be all right for next season They're just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder back in shap- it was his shoulder wasn't it that he had the problems with I think it was his shoulder he had surgery on But anyway they're trying to you know keep him from reinjuring anything but anyway Thirty day notice for what really What okay maybe I'll call you back after the recording is finished Actually I think we have talked about football for five minutes I can't remember Really I usually have too Yeah I've done that once or twice I didn't look at the clock when we started talking so I guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in Yeah So other than the Vikings who do you like oh Yeah Uh-huh Back when they were in Saint Louis Since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been all that impressive I guess I guess I've always been a Cowboy fan Other than that I mean you know you know when you grow up in a city that has you know one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kind of tend to get caught up in it Yeah Yeah I mean it was really exciting growing up when the Cowboys were really big Because my parents would always have season tickets and they'd go to all the games and you know the hype were just unbelievable It's just you know the last I guess probably since about eighty-four about eighty-five was when they started kind of going downhill really but you know I'm just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys Cowboys Cowboys and you know Super Bowl and all this other stuff So I can't you know I'm not going to decide I don't like them just because they're having a few bad years I mean I think they'll pull out of it and you know they'll wind up being good again They've got lot of really good young players that are going to do pretty good I think <> But they're raising prices on their tickets So they're banking on doing good next season I think tickets are Yeah Thirty or thirty-two for really good tickets See they sectioned it out even more They used to just have like first of all it was all one price And then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else And now they're sectioning it off like from one twenty yard line to the other one just on the lower levels is the highest price and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line And then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the direct end zones But they have about four or five different prices now that they're structuring it with but obviously yeah they're all going up more or less is what it's going to do you know I'm not sure I'm not positive I didn't really think about that I just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper But not that I'll ever go I hadn't been to a Cowboys game last time I went to the Cowboys game was during that N F L strike or when they had the scab teams in there and it was the Dallas and Washington Redskins game And I went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because a lot of those doctors have season tickets and if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else So I went with my dad to a game that one time But that wasn't a real you know it was the scab teams you know it was kind of different I guess And before that it's been quite a few years I've been wanting to go to a game I just never have gotten around to it So maybe this year Oh
