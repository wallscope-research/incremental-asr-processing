Okay I guess if I had to rate it from one to ten I guess I would rate it a five in the aspect that I wouldn't want everybody to have guns and I think there should be limitations of like semiautomatics things like that should not be just given out to anybody In fact you know I can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose so I guess you know being that I come from a hunting family I'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles things that people would use for sporting type of a activity Those would be fine but when you get into a lot of the more complex weapons I would say yes we need to put restrictions on them Uh-huh Uh-huh Exactly for self-protection sure I can't imagine that Yeah Uh-huh To do massive amounts of killing Yeah The only thing that I can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is you know going to kill a massive amount of people or somebody that's escaping that's very dangerous semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and get him down But you know I think of my family they're very much into sporting you know as far as hunting and also like clay pigeons things like that So they may have some shotguns They may have other type of hunting type things but I figured if the criminals had to take a hunting gun out to kill somebody more than likely somebody would see it you know what I'm saying versus you know a small handgun that can be you know put right in your coat pocket and nobody would see it but yet you can't stop people from having you know a handgun in their home Even if there are small children around you know you can't say people with small children can't have guns and people without small children that may have grandchildren you know still have these guns but I guess I was always taught number one a gun isn't a toy you know and I don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you you know and don't ever play with it so I don't know if that makes a difference or what but Uh-huh The criminals would get them I mean even if they had to go across border to get them Uh-huh How you know to make sure the guns are put up as not a toy Yeah Because we had guns all over our house when we were kids and not that they were laying on the couch or anything like that but I never had an interest in them being in the fact that I knew that guns could kill and I had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy and of course we were quite young and we went through the National Rifle Club and so we were taught you know kind of at a good age ten and eleven and twelve to sit down with a kid and say okay if you're going to learn how to shoot a gun you're going to learn how to do it correctly and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and know how to protect yourself but yet have this training so that kids aren't you know they have to have a certain respect for it Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Sure yeah Yes Yeah Yeah I think so and I don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what
