For N I S T the National Institute of Standards and Technology I suppose so Let me push the button Okay I guess I'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system but I sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon Uh-huh You're now in what Acoustics Well I guess that is the policy but it's been the policy for a long time and nothing ever happens I suppose some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening having a new generation come up that's more used to it They have to for international trade But I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be because of computers coming into everything Everyone wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a concept to hold in mind I don't see that it can change it very quickly I mean we're not the kind of society that something can be posed upon by government will the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems money dollar coins anything like that and it obviously makes no sense that we're practically alone in the world in using the old system Well I mean unfortunate- I think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day I mean there are things you could do we have signs up on the N I S T campus here speed limit twenty-five miles per hour forty kilometers per hour but that hasn't been adopted very widely I mean and no one will go a step further to remove the english signs yeah or you have highway signs saying speed limit eighty eighty-five whatever would be the appropriate number Hundred car is going sixty-two yeah so it would be more like ninety I guess car is going fifty-five you suddenly have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now do you know where you are do the schools emphasize the metric system No I meant down like in the elementary schools I mean I think Yeah I mean I think my children learned the metric system but it doesn't get emphasized over the other
