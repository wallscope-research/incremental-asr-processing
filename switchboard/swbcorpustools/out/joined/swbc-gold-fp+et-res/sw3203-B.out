Okay We have a four bedroom split brick home in Richardson actually And we bought it back in about nineteen seventy-three So we've seen it go up in value wise real well Yes Yes yes it looks like all the others It's Uh-huh I know where that is Yeah should this be two slash units/ Yes you're in the styles that they have started building in the last couple years with the real high ceilings and uh-huh those are lovely Oh nice Yes Have you found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are quite a bit higher with those high ceilings Are they Uh-huh Well I would expect so I have wondered about the cooling and the heating Especially the cooling Wow Uh-huh Well how many bedrooms do you have in your home uh-huh how nice should this be two slash units/ Uh-huh That's a pretty good size room That's neat Well it sounds like a real nice one Right Where did you move from uh-huh Uh-huh Do you like the Dallas area And I would imagine that you have found that the homes down here are a much better value down here aren't they than they are really Now that's interesting Uh-huh That's interesting because I've heard so many people down here say that they don't feel like the quality of the homes you know are that good down here so that's interesting Well that's good Well I know as I said our house is about seventeen years old and we've been very pleased with it We've had no major problems with it Knock on wood And you know it is with the you know two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it all the time and we like our neighborhood it has grown and the majority of the people you know keep up the neighborhood And that's very important and as I said it has risen in value But we bought back when housing was so low you know and now i- you know i- then it started jumping by leaps and bounds It seems to have leveled off and actually dropped back down a little bit but we're still fine Uh-huh uh-huh Yes It should bring up your property values a little bit Your pricing Uh-huh I think once the economic situation in the Dallas area improves I think the housing will go up You know Right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs and everything so you know that keeps prices down and value down and I'm sure the packs or would like for it to go up That's right That's right
