So do you have any credit cards Uh-huh Okay Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I have one card And I try not to use it but right now it's maxed out Uh-huh Yeah I have the thing that bothers me worse than the credit cards I think is you mentioned the gasoline credit card I don't have that but I've got you know one of the instant teller cards that you can use for point of sale purchases And we use that usually to buy gasoline and it's really amazing how quickly that goes Uh-huh Yeah Yeah that's what they've talked about it Course it eliminates any waiting period God help those people who have to float checks occasionally because you won't be able to with that No it was well they consider it to be the same as cash well cause it actually is Yeah It's better than cash They don't even have to deposit it it just goes straight in there Right Uh-huh Yeah but I'm so glad he told me they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them They paid them off and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them She said at least before she could use them she'd have to thaw them out I mean that's funny Yeah Yeah I want to still have just one just in case But I'd sure want to get it paid down and not use it for a while Uh-huh Yeah Well our limit is you know fairly low and so that's one thing that's good I've got another call Okay All right Bye-bye
