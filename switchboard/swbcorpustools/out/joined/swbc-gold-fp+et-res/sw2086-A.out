Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh That's very spicy too I mean these bell peppers and curry that sounds really good Huh I guess it was is this dinner time for you All done in advance yeah I'm not that great a cook but I was single until I was thirty so I did cook a little you know and I cook a little bit now What I like to do mostly is stir fries and my wife normally says Tom why don't you make a stir fry tonight and so we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok And we do a lot of stir fry vegetables it's called a stir fry pan it fits right on your burner whether it's gas or electric so it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does And normally what we do is just you know like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular vegetable oil But I will use peanut oil or things And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and green peppers and maybe put in a little bit of garlic and ginger beforehand That gives spicier flavor and then after the stir fry is over just mix in a little bit of sometimes chicken broth and corn starch and soy sauce and that sort of makes a glaze that sticks to the vegetables I've used you turn them over A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu we don't put in meat cause I guess I'm not but she likes to watch how much red meat and things so We'll do a lot of times vegetarian But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and carrots and celery and green peppers and gee mushrooms it's a pretty big and we put that over rice you don't Oh Uh-huh Yeah see in fact I never had squash growing up my wife ate more vegetable than I did growing up/ I'm from Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town Yeah recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato Red meat and a potato she had all of those types of vegetables See no vegetables in my family Yeah it was really funny Well that was a real farm No but I've heard stories I've heard stories  this is ter- you shouldn't be talking about this while you're fixing dinner That's right you should be careful That's pretty funny But my dad used to tell stories you know about the way they eat chickens but we lived in the suburbs we bought everything in a grocery store There was no but it was funny you know it so but when we got married you know a lot more vegetables you know a lot of changes I think so too but we just went shopping and we came back with sweets you know chocolate covered peanuts and we came back with sweets We didn't bring all the healthy food back too Uh-huh well that's supposed to be the trend of the future but the cut back recently was over a friends house that's Indian and she had brought Indian sweets into the office and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots Yeah that was a sweet and I was like ugh This is a sweet it's a candy I'm like ugh you know Indian candy is not very good and everything you didn't notice it at first but everything was sort of hot Everything had a little bit of curry in it It was funny even the sweets did When you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it You know it had that after taste that it was a very Indian flavor Good they didn't have I didn't like her desserts very well they were very yogurt and carrots and pistachio nuts and yogurt And it wasn't very good Uh-huh Yeah well have we done our ten minutes Something like that I think we're No normally they just come in and they say you've overextended your conversation okay well that's you'll see it will come on and it'll say you've over extended your conversation you now have fifteen seconds to complete it But I've been cut off twice So I just thought in fact I'm just also I'm hearing a siren outside I think my neighbors car must have got bumped you know he has one of those alarms on his car the neighbor has an alarm on a car and it's going off So I was going to go out and see what they were doing Okay hey thanks so much Uh-huh and you said this was your fi- well you'll get a couple more probably I called yesterday or Friday maybe I talked to somebody that I got them on during the day It was a housewife and she was home with two kids And while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background you know that they wanted something and they were arguing back and forth and she just kept talking the whole time it was pretty funny Okay Hey thanks a lot I'll talk to you later Bye
