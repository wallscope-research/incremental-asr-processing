So what do you think about a year or two of public service Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh You know I really agree with you though I've never done that myself I was a basically an education major when I graduated from college and I accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to very rural children in a very low income district and I spent a year teaching there and I think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because I come from nice middle class white suburban home and I did it for one reason I wanted I was working on a masters degree so I wanted to stay close to where I was working on a masters degree but also because I just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing and I it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me and I think in fact if I had to do it all again I you know after that you know you never think of it I guess because I paid for all of my college education myself I never thought about doing that because I had all these college loans I'd started paying back beca- so that was one reason why I never considered it but now that I'm further along and I'm still paying these college loans I think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school at thirty years old I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed and I thought that was you know very interesting and I would have thought of that earlier I probably would have done you know just like is that the Mormon church that does that Because one of my neighbors did that in Pittsburgh from Pittsburgh And I thought you know that really now that I'm thirty years old I think that one or two years out of my life would have probably like you said to be able to travel some place else whether it be the United States or outside the country I think it would have been a very good experience for me Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah And I think you know we have such a need now you know I taught you know I think I was paid about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and I worked in a very rural school district and one of the things I taught was a computer class and these kids you know every girl I taught except for one was pregnant Many of the boys in the room had children and they were high school juniors And I just there you know they came from poverty they were going to condition in poverty and it was the school district couldn't hire many people it was very difficult for them to hire and I think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical things I think it's a really good idea And even if it is overseas See I never I tell you sometimes I worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I think it would also help them if they then went on to college I know that my first couple of years of college were probably too carefree at the beginning and then at the end I had to be too serious Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that's true Uh-huh that's right I yeah I think this was a very interesting topic because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough you know Uh-huh Yeah that's true Uh-huh I think it is I really think I think people you should I you know the kids today I teach I spend a lot of my time teaching college students and I find great disgust in them in their self-centeredness and their inability to understand multicultural or multiracial situation and I really you know they don't understand how other people live they don't understand Uh-huh Yeah I think that's just having a good time I a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as short-term pleasure oriented I guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it you know today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun Uh-huh Yeah Well they say I think I have read recently that the Bush Administration has increased the funding for the Peace Corps Uh-huh Because I guess because of the changes in Eastern Europe they've increased funding for the Peace Corps I guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known when they're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps and some of the are the overseas programs Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah that's true Uh-huh Yeah that's very true You know how many is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country and I guess I live near Washington being in Baltimore it's something like one in four people in the Washington area are lawyers and I just sort of think that's ridiculous Yeah with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and you know the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah you saw statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run Yeah that's true That's interesting Uh-huh Okay Hey thanks so much for the conversation Well thank you very much Bye-bye
