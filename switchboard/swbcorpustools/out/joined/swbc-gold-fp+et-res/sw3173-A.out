All right why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for in your next Uh-huh And of course it has to have air-conditioning Does it have to be a special color It sounds like something your husband would drive right Yes Well I don't think we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one but when we were looking we were looking for something that had enough seat belts of course and we wanted air-conditioning and a five speed and that was kind of iffy but that made it better economically so Yeah We'll probably have to look for another second car sometime and we'd look for about what you're looking for but probably real cheap too It wouldn't be a used car but no Uh-huh Would you like four doors or doesn't really matter Yeah it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes It would be fun just to win one wouldn't it That would be great All right well I think that's all that we need to say All right we'll talk to you later Bye-bye
