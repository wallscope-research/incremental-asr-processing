Well Brent I kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because I thought it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school And I thought it was a good sacrifice to make because it was important to me to spend some time with kids I know that when I was in school and getting my degree at the same time it was really hard on our family because he would come home and I would leave and then I would come home and he would leave and so I think one day one of our kids said you know someone came home and they said well when is dad leaving or something It was like that they thought that's the way life was that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time And so I think it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family So there's one or two nights a week we have a on Monday nights we set aside time where it's called family home evening and we stay home that evening all of us and we do things together Yes you are Yes and So you do that right and then we try to do a family activity on Saturday usually in the morning Right and then you know sometimes we try to do our lesson on Sunday night and then our activity or something on Monday but it's real important to us to spend time together I have two Uh-huh I have a girl and a boy and the boy's five he's in kindergarten and the girl is four She'll be in kindergarten next year Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh They are a handful Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh Uh-huh Well no and it's not as stable for the kids and everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now But it's yeah Well it's also important I think for my husband I try to go out of my way to plan things that he can do with the kids because since I am home with them and so I get a lot of time with them he needs to have some time with them So when he comes home you know it's his job at night He puts the kids to bed and he reads to them and he spends about an hour doing that and that's pretty good quality time with them but it's hard for him on Saturdays Right he wants to run out and get things done and so I try to say well why don't you go fly kites or why don't you do something And if I have something in mind then he remembers that that's what he wants to do Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh Well that's right But I do think you know like the current trends are that the family unit is devaluated It's not nearly as important We find that you know back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems the first place they went to was their family And families took care of themselves but now you know they don't support each other that way Uh-huh That's right and Right right And it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make because you know you know I have interests too and it is hard to make those interests not be as a major part of my life Uh-huh Uh-huh Right It is temporary in the middle of it it seems like a long time but you're right it is temporary Well I see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids and in spite of Uh-huh Yes That's true Uh-huh Yeah Well it is the hardest thing I've ever done as much as you'd go out and Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that's good Uh-huh No Yeah I think so I think it's an investment in your future even if it's purely not religious You can at least say that it's important to our country that our family unit stays strong Yes
