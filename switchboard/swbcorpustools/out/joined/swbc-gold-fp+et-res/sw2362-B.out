we have one She's only nine months old Right Well my degree is in teaching so really Uh-huh Did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels or Uh-huh Well my degree was in fourth through seventh grade but I taught junior high And I expected it to be a lot of trouble but it wasn't that bad I taught remedial reading kids And well they don't call it remedial reading these days they call it something else but anyway at the time that's what I taught And you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way when you have your slow readers but it wasn't too bad we got long real well Yeah I especially with the real young ones I started out wanting to teach lower like primary and then top primary and thought well no I don't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth and so that's what I got my certification in But I had decided long before I was even married that I wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools and my reason for that was I don't like what's the right word The varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools You can find a lot of good public schools if you look real hard but I don't think they could cover everything that you could teach your children on an individual basis Yeah Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah And the crime is just escalated and the drugs and even in the lower schools  Uh-huh Right Crazy for him to but Uh-huh Yeah Well we had the problem when I was in with teaching I was eighth and ninth graders that I worked with and if we did have a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there And you don't know if you were reaching them or not but we felt like you know maybe just going ahead and trying to teach them was better than have them taken out Yeah Right most the time if they were some of them were even better behaved I've only had two instances where it was really noticeable but they were better behaved when they were I don't know if was alcohol or something else that they were on but it ended up better but I think there's a problem too with teachers trying <> to be so versatile that they do loose sight of the basics you know they've been a big drive especially in the seventies to return back to the basics and I'm not completely you know just teach the basics in schools but I think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because of our lower grades in the standardized test and such Right Uh-huh Well I spent a year and a half in Japan also and I've seen how their school system works and I they go by a complete rote system you just memorize everything And then at the end of a certain time period you spitted everything back out and the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be So I don't completely agree with that either But there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere is it Is that what you ended up going into Oh Uh-huh how much can you stuff in your brain Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Well good question Probably Taking No There's plenty of money in the system it's just I think it's like a lot of things in the United States We've got so much built up in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it and in the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again and there's no way that that can be done Not without wiping out a whole generation of kids in the school system so Maybe on smaller scales <> Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right into the classroom it needs to be able <> to be enforced Uh-huh It's like doctors in lawsuits you know they're kind of fearful of everything that's well at least I've heard that I haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's been applicable to me but Uh-huh Right Uh-huh yeah it has to be reinforced in the home Yeah Right Uh-huh Yeah They allow it under certain circumstances You have to prove that you're teaching them something You have to follow a preferred curriculum they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum although you don't have to And then if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored You know they will allow you to I can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that I don't think they're were in this area but they are monitored by the State School Board So Uh-huh Uh-huh
