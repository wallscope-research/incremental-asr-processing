what kind of house do you live in yeah with a yard and fence I'm in an apartment in Plano Yeah they are if kind of depends on what you're looking for Mine's just a one bedroom place that's it's hard for me to tell because I haven't rented in probably twenty twenty-five years and just I'm getting back into apartment life and it's Yeah Well they vary from place to place it's hard to tell you know how well they've been kept up how old they are and these are probably one of the nicest that I found and they're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place Yeah it does considering that you know house payments are not a whole lot more than that Yeah Wow that's a lot for a townhouse But that's what happens when you get up in this area you know you got all these companies are up here and these and I guess they know they're going to get it Yeah Yeah that's true you just take off your mortgage interest and that's about it Yeah I've owned several built several Well and especially around North Dallas or at least in Plano area they basically all look alike because Fox and Jacobs Isn't it I can remember I've only been here eight years but I can remember coming to work from I used to live in Wylie and I could see downtown Dallas and now there's this brown haze over it and it's moving north yeah Yeah Yeah it does How long have you been in this house Ten years No you really don't you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than Dallas area How was it how were the house prices up there Yeah Wow yeah well you know a lot of these people that I've talked to that are coming down from like what I call the back East especially from J C Penney are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy-five thousand dollar houses down here and they've wound up getting better houses here than they had there so in a way I guess it works both ways Yeah That's a fact I guess that's true And they don't have to worry about yard upkeep if they don't hardly have any That's true not too many basements in Texas Yeah gosh I remember when I was little we didn't have a I grew up in southern Oklahoma and people across the street had a cellar and we never did and it's just like Dallas area it was tornado alley up there and every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street and we'd go into the cellar and I to this day I don't care if I go or not you know if it's going to get me it's get me Yeah You ever thought about building a house Have you ever thought about building a house Yeah that's true especially when with T I it's like anybody else you never know how long you're going to be in one place you know Yeah Do you work Do you work Well how do you handle do you have kids So you got he's working and working to get this big house to take care of how do you manage both of those Yeah You basically can take care of everything yourself Yeah Yeah What about home repairs and stuff do you have to do all that yourself or you too Yeah yeah Sounds like you've already got the makings for being a general contractor If you don't wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together Yeah I built three houses in my life and they the building process was a lot of fun but puts a lot of strain on things Yeah You bet you bet yeah Well to some of them I guess it doesn't matter you know that maybe they've got enough coming in to take care of it Are they as far as they're concerned they've come to the promised land you know they've got it made yeah because you're confined by space you know I had a I came out of a thirty-one hundred square foot two story house And I had room for everything in fact I had more room than knew what to do with I don't know just seems like stuff always expands to fill available space but Yeah you can you know you lear- you adjust you figure out It's not as bad as I thought it was it's not as bad as I remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be there seems to be more a mature crowd in apartments at least where I am even though you know there's kids all around and there's traffic and there's people running up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that but still Yeah pretty much and there's never really any I remember in school there's just seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night You don't run into that up here I think because there's so many professional people if you want to call them that that go spend all day at work and they want to come home and they want some quiet You see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes playing ball or jogging or they're doing this and that and they're trying to unwind yeah it's a hundred and what eighty thousand something like that yeah you bet and the thing that gets me is you never really catch up you never really finish doing things and you're always paying for something you are constantly there's always something going wrong
