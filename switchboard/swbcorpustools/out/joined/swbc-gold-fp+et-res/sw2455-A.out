Well I wondered if I was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type I was afraid we might get into an argument Well I guess there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations for the roles of women and I guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now And trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or you know all sorts of other things I think so Absolutely I think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days Sometimes I think I am going crazy trying to do it but Yes yes They are getting older now so they are not quite as much of a responsibility but they are still there you know they still take time and you know I still provide most of the things that go on around the house So yeah and for a while I was going to school too and it was tough Uh-huh Uh-huh But in some ways I think we are expected to do it all You're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things and that's where the problem is really Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Right Yeah Yeah it's a tough one I mean I've done some of both when my kids were real little I was at home for a couple of different periods of time I think the longest was less than a year but still at least I was able to spend you know those first months with them But I mostly went back to work because I was tired of doing without things You know the money was the issue But even now I would like to not have to work in some ways it's kind of pull and tug on the other hand I can't imagine just being at home although I have a lot of interests and a lot of things I would like to pursue still there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having you know a job and all that goes with that Oh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah that's a good deal Where do you think this is going in the future I mean do you think things are going to change or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this Yeah Uh-huh I don't yeah well I see I think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the family things work but I don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers you know It's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are I don't know if they want to completely give that up But it would be nice if there could be an in-between a middle ground somewhere Yeah Well yeah I think they like a routine of sorts Well yes I like the fact that you know gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions but it's still a long way from being what it ought to be Yeah Okay well I enjoyed talking to you All right good-bye
