Okay before a couple of years ago I had a very narrow view of nursing homes and it was more like a funeral home I always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home And then I had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler Texas and I went to one and it just had a very good activities director Everyone was cheerful and now I don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore But I certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last resort I have a sister that is in nursing school and she's real interested in geriatrics Yeah So she's real interested in what Ann Richards has been doing Ann Richards is really cracking down on the nursing homes and you wouldn't know anything about a Texas governor Okay Ann Richards is our governor in Texas and she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes And my sister's real interested in that and getting into that side of nursing Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Right Right Right Uh-huh It sure is And some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older yeah Right My grandfather passed away several years ago I was much younger But he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life and someone visited him every day My grandmother did But if she couldn't someone visited him every day It was in a very small town nursing home And people didn't get paid much there at all They didn't care about what went on They would let a patient get a lot of bed sores And the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people And then the nurses and doctors really didn't put forth any loving care for them Right Right Uh-huh Right Right And nurses get so worn down Right sure And they feel pretty helpless Is it like a retirement center Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh How's he handling that Uh-huh  sure There wasn't anything like that that you could do in Florida
