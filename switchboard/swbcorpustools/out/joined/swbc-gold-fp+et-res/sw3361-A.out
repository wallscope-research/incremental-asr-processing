Okay Well Carolyn one of the main things I'd like to know is how do you feel about knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth What do you think would be required and so forth you knew of the homes then You knew of the homes themselves Uh-huh okay Yeah Well from your point of view how would you feel about actually sending someone that's you know means something to you to one of those homes I realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it and of course that makes sense but how do you think they would feel I should say about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new home situation Uh-huh okay Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh Well how do you find that your personal relationship is with her know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal does that cause any problems between the two of you Uh-huh Is she It's hard to accept the fact that you're unable to pursue life at the level that you did before isn't it Yeah It is different I had that almost similar situation My mother lives in an apartment with my sister so I except for the three or four months this summer that's the only time I ever spent with my mother and of course since I see her only once or twice a year I was just thrilled to have her here with me and I spent every minute I could to be with her and cooking foods for her you know just to make her life as though she were on vacation But somehow another that doesn't work between my mom and my sister and they find they are in speaking they I don't know my mother feels uncomfortable around my sister and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there and I guess it's just because they're there all the time So it has put pressure on both of them from that point of view So that's kind of bad news And by the same token my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home and after all she has been a farmer's wife for sixty years and now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm into another home where the environment is totally different She's relatively happy but she doesn't like the food And when she complains about the food then they kind of get angry with her So that's another one of those things you have to solve Yeah after all their life is so totally different because in those early days the food they had to make it from scratch so to speak I mean you raised your own chickens and you killed your own hogs I suppose and then they had to store the meat in I don't want to say barns but they had regular little places they would hang it you know to cure it and so forth and now all of a sudden it comes in differently it tastes differently
