What Do you want to start Right You are right Yeah I suppose I should have Uh-huh yeah I guess I hate to see anyone die but I guess these people that go around and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse I don't think they deserve to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Well and even that I don't really know if that would help I think a lot of these people do it mainly because of of T V and a- the double reason they see it being done on T V and also the fact of notoriety I mean they become well known They are almost like a big star Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Right Yeah Well I think if they went according to the BIBLE where it does say an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life you take a life you give yours that's for sure there's exceptions to the rule I mean if it's an accidental taking then you look at that but you know most of these people that down right go right and do it out of pure pleasure I don't like to see that I guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent it is a deterrent in the sense that that person will never do it again not if he's killed he can't do it again The death penalty Uh-huh Right Uh-huh yeah Well I guess I'm also looking at beyond even that I guess I been thinking about it and I don't have a definite opinion but repeat crimes maybe not the more mild ones but you know more severe ones especially on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people and not just taking the money but beating them half to death Just for pleasure too and I guess you've got to look at something like that Do they deserve to remain on this earth too Right Right Yeah Uh-huh
