Sox that's about it I mean we do a lot of little trips around here and Not that much We've gone out to a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water have you ever heard of it Yeah it's really neat It's this house built on a waterfall and it's really cool of course we keep picking crummy weather to go out there the first time we went out there was the day after hurricane Hugo had come through So I mean they didn't have any power and it was really cold and rainy and we went up about a year later and it was better but not a whole lot better So where else did we go <> we've gone to Richland last year and had a good time down there my girlfriend has with her sisters but I haven't been down there I hear that's nice We're going to get down probably down Norfork sometime this Summer just to catch a football game actually spend a day and a lot of money Yeah I've heard I'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of the price attached to it We just we I  yeah we'll do that okay so I can wander around without okay I just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings okay I didn't know that Yeah I think they do the whole with you know paying they really did throw away a lot of money getting one thing or another but they had a good time so  Yeah I was we use it live in California and my up around San Francisco and there was one year when my father's company was starting to do stuff down in Los Angeles so my father was working down in Los Angeles for like six months or so actually it was closer I think to a full year and you know he'd fly down there on Mondays and fly back on Fridays well any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles so I went to Disneyland about five times in one year and I really have no great urge to go back now it was great because well the times that were really fun were when we had vacation but the kids in Los Angeles didn't so we basically had one of the parks I mean there's still a lot of people at Disneyland but there was another amusement park down there Busch Gradens there was nobody there when we were there we won a log floating ride like five straight times we just get done with them and
