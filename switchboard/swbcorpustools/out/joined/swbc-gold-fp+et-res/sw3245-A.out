Okay so we're going to talk about what kind of clothes we wear while we work Do you work for T I you do well you're like me then I stay home also Yes I have two a seven year old and three and a half year old How about you Oh my you are busy and they're all girls I have two girls so all girls around here Yes really sweet That's how I am too Uh-huh Uh-huh slash error Uh-huh slash error should be 'b' that's funny Yeah Yeah Yeah I know that's kind of how I am I said who ever I talk to is going to be board because when it's summer time I'm wearing shorts and when it's cold I'm wearing sweat pants unless I'm going to something special that my daughter's doing or something like that Well that's good I used to wear jeans all the time until after I had kids and now nothing seems to be comfortable because I bulge in all the wrong places so Yeah Right yeah Yeah yeah I know what you mean Well Oh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh That's right One of my daughters was born in June and I remember I wore sundresses and you know just those real cool dresses almost the entire time And I had one that was born in December so it was a little bit because it was a real warm winter so even into like November and December I was still wearing the short sleeve dresses course I'm always hot when I'm pregnant too so I didn't really need warm clothes but I really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new units outfits you know that are just knit they are so comfortable it's just you know a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff and it's just great because you know you can decorate them up or dress them up if you want or you can just wear them with you know tennis shoes if you want So they're really nice and I've enjoyed wearing those but I Yeah well I don't either if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a big difference I worked part time when my oldest was a baby and I had to wear a dress every day and it was a little bit hard to wind down I would have to drive six thirty five home and I would be burning up like in the summer time by the time I got home I was like I've got to get out of these clothes Uh-huh Right Right Yeah Yeah Yeah and then when you drive home like especially if you're in a lot of traffic which you are in Dallas uh-huh because I always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time I was afraid I'd make the car overheat Yeah so I would roll my windows down it was still a hundred degrees and I would just be sweltering hot by the time I picked my daughter up and I had a friend who used to take shorts to work and after work she'd go in the bathroom and change her clothes and I thought that's probably a good idea because you really yeah because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned which I don't have any of No when you have children you don't even when I go to church I have to have something I can just throw in the washer when I'm through That's right or if you get it dirty or whatever slash error: two utts I know it Me too I know that's how I am too Right me neither I have
