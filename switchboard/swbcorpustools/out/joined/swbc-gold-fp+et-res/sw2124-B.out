well I like to cook foods I like to eat I like to eat Italian food best And I find that that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals type things and they're kind of convenient Right I usually have parties that are smaller groups I've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like Thanksgiving and such And so yeah I guess I usually do I like to cook heavy sauces and noodles and pasta and such Yeah actually How about you what do you like to cook Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh really Humidity or something Uh-huh It kind of down played compared to what you would like huh Do you find yourself with all the cholesterol and high fiber changing the way that you entertain Uh-huh no Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah That sounds good Well every once in a while I think I feel the same way When I'm entertaining I don't take that thing into consideration unless it's really really like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories so I think dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play sometimes yeah Yeah yeah that's good Uh-huh nothing comes to mind right off so I guess not Okay you too Bye bye
