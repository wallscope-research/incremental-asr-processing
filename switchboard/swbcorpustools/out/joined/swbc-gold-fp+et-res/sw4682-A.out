Have you had that experience recently yeah Oh Well I don't have so much trouble with products as service I don't feel like that's as big a problem I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent the one I have now is okay most of the time But that's it But that's probably the worst My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed James Avery I don't know if you have that up there but it's a very good company That sells sterling silver things and she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now and the catch broke and she was sitting in school on a carpet and when she stood up it caught and broke and we took it back and they said this was just obviously yanked This was yanked I mean they were so rude about it And so we wanted a different kind of catch and she said well it's not guaranteed And I said well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed so do it anyway So we got the kind we wanted and I was really disappointed with that I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable and I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends and I called there to see if they had it and the lady was very nice And I said my goodness I said you've been very nice what's your name And she told me and I said well I really appreciate it I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store and it turned out she was the assistant manager so Right So I felt kind of good about that you know I didn't even know the person's name that had given <> me the hard time or anything but I just felt like well at least I did something Maybe they'll fix it They might work on that you know But I find attitudes are more of a problem Service is more of a problem Really That's really great Huh That's really good It use to be like that But I don't think most places are like that anymore
