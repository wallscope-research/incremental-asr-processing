Okay You probably more up on this subject than I am but the roles that women have played in the last or couple of generations You bet You bet You know where I've noticed it more I think is I'm a traveling salesperson and I have traveled most of my life and I know just especially in the last ten years and really since in the last half of dozen years I see more and more women traveling You know as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers I sell sporting goods and even in our industry there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things I sell and even in the last five or six years boy we see more and more women being involved and you know it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things You bet You bet That's sort of neat Sure I think it's the age old thing every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on T V or something where the discussion comes out that you know women are paid less than men and they're doing the same or carrying the same job responsibility and you know that's a very true statement and it shouldn't be that way You know I hope so a- Absolutely You know I've Right Yeah they forget Also I think a good argument for that is in the area of politics you know if a a woman Congressman I'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman and the same as a senator or whatever So they certainly deserve it all the way But I guess just the most significant thing changed for me again as I mentioned was just in traveling you see more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and in their business suits and going And I expect you're right in regards to having two parents now That's a good statement And I think if in the future it's even going to be more noticeable and more significant Wow You bet Good point Right now I'm self employed and my wife's always worked She's a schoolteacher but for she started working and then when I first started my business she was selling real estate at the time and hers was the only income we had for three or four months so You know she certainly did her part in help getting me establishing in my business and she still works everyday so You bet Uh-oh enjoying it What kind of work do you do Well good Right Married Yeah Well trying to think what else I can say in regards to this subject You see the old cigarette ads you know about you've come a long way Baby right and You think about this when it comes to a subject like that and it's really true Women have come a long way and you know
