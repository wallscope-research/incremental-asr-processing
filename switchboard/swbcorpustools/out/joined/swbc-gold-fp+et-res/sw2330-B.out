Yeah Well I think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than I would expect this time of year Yeah Yeah I was out in my yard yesterday afternoon and I noticed all that grass coming up and I thought ooh we've got to start this mowing bit soon Yeah Well I guess another thing I've noticed too here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days it's been awfully gray you know just Yeah But it seems like every time at work I look out my window it's gray I go for that yeah In fact I'm a little worried about this one coming up here We have a long weekend and it sounds like it's going to be a little bit on the cool side I think there's an eighty percent chance this evening but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the rest will be without rain But I think the highs are going to be in the sixties and the lows in the forties That's getting back to a little bit chillier Yeah I'm not certain either but you're probably right Well I like it when it's sort of a medium temperature maybe seventy-five to eighty somewhere in there I don't like it when it's too cool or too warm I'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature  Yeah You're probably right Yes as a matter of fact I heard the weather the other day on T V and I think it was one day this week a year ago they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather You know it wasn't just a super bad storm but it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the late spring time wow  Yeah that is pretty unusual And you really take notice of it too  Wow I don't like that super cold stuff I just don't move very well when it's that cold Yeah well not a real in depth topic but enjoyed talking to you Okay Bye-bye
