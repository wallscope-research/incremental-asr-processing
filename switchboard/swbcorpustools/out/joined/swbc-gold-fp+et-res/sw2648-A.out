So well this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day so well what do you think is the main pollutants in the air Yeah well that's me too After on channel thirteen they had some programs the day before and I'm not sure that about yesterday we didn't really watch it too much yesterday but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and you know how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do as the people and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot and that actually as our population increases and you know you know our number of cars increase per the population that's the problem But also like you said the industry pollution and you know they're regulation that's placed on them I mean it's better than it used to be but it's incredible that they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air You know I just I can't stand that and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that you know they're supposed to be regulated because I don't know about T I but we have a Pillsbury plant in a town adjacent to ours and I know people that work there that of course you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of what they do to make their dough and to clean out the flour and stuff like that yeah I mean it's incredible And they said that you know they have a little creek that runs by them and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they you know shut down everything and they clean up their act but on a normal basis that they're dumping things that they're not supposed to be dumping and I'm like if they're getting away with it can you imagine that's a Pillsbury plant I can't imagine plants Yeah they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff you know to break the flours down and then they also do testing there and I don't you know when you consider you know it's probably not radioactive but toxic can be anything that's classified that can damage the Earth So there could be a lot of things that they could put you know that chemical wise that they use to that they are testing with that they're dumping Yeah Yeah I don't think they do the packaging at this plant but they do a lot of research and they do a lot of the refining up there or I'm not really what's it called when you do flour I'm not Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah But I mean you think about it you know it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just I'm not really sure but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down or stream or such or you can you know do testing on the ground itself at that point but when they pollute into the air you know and you've got movement through the air it's going to move a lot of that off So I don't see you know how they can do some of the te- unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution you know like in Los Angeles or the bigger cities where it tends to get stuck there you know that you have a lot more particles in the air you know particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away but Uh-huh Yeah well I know out in some I'm not sure I can't remember the name of the county it's where Stillwater is or sweet no I'm not sure I know it I think it's I know we have a piece property there it's called Dublin it's in Dublin Texas I'm not really sure what the county it's Stephen no Stephenville Okay where Stephenville's at they've had a lot of problems because they've introduced a lot of dairies there so they have a lot of cattle in the area I mean  they've got like per lot you know they've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't th- it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free they've got to have them there to be able to milk them And they and I read in this article I couldn't believe it where you know like one cow like a day produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure One cow I was like my God and they and this thing says that you know people think well cow manure is good for fertilizer but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not when you know you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it and they've added humus and stuff that breaks it down and this article said that they've got a real problem that you've got toxins and bacteria in the manure that is what it's doing is it's going through they don't have a very deep o- you know they're natural water I forget what that's called with you know it's like a spring water but it's below the surface it's not very far down and all this stuff is seeping through to the water and like they're afraid that you know within a certain amount of years they're water in that town will be totally polluted and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have completely polluted so that you know there's too many toxins and bacterial growth and I'm like my God you know you know just from them introducing dairy farms in that one county No not when you figure I didn't realize one cow produces that much manure and they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area You Well they are evidently But I mean evidently a normal cow produces that much too but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not you know a problem but when they get them in these tiny little areas you know they've got a real big problem and they said that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff and taking it to these like ponds that they had to filter it with but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years they just overflow and they overflow into the creeks and stuff in the area So that just creates you know there's and it was just disgusting it said the creeks will foam people stand outside their houses and watch the creeks foam brown and all and I'm just like my gosh and the smell is really bad they sa- Yeah but I don't know it really frightens me though as far as you know thinking of just air pollution itself and channel thirteen they're really emphasizing the problem with acid rain you know if we keep putting that stuff into the air and you know if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it it's really going to be a problem for you know what the Earth is receiving back you know because how can you tell where it's going to come down at Yeah The rain forest and all Yeah Well they do because what is it carbon dioxide they use that where we can't synthesize it and they're synthesizing it for us Yeah Yeah I think we just have to I don't know personally you know I suppose you know if you just make sure your car is working properly and yo- you know they're suppos- nowadays they have the emission controls on them but I think the main thing is just keep on your legislators back you know as far as seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying okay we're really going to get involved it's really becoming a problem By the year two thousand there will what are we going to have what kind of results are we going to have for the environment and what will we
