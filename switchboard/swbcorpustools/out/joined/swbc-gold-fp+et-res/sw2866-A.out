H- well Myrna how do you get your news Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh yeah I'm pretty much the same I find that I'm a graduate student and I read a lot for school and I find I have no patience to really read a newspaper because I'm reading so much all the time And I really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast Uh-huh yeah that's true Uh-huh That's right yeah Yeah that's right I agree That's a lot of times I eat while I'm watching the news Yeah the same thing Is there any what did you think about the coverage like over in the Persian Gulf Yeah I thought so too it you know for a while when we were really interested we saw it all the time Some of the stations I guess carried it for twenty-four hours for a couple of days there and then you know the special reports and the extended news coverage I thought was really good Yeah Yeah right yeah just news that's right yeah Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh well that's great Uh-huh Yeah or if you have a break in the middle of the day you take a coffee break you can always stay informed Yeah that's really good I've found that when I don't have cable television anymore when I moved went back to graduate school I just didn't have the money to rent a cable T V line or whatever you know So I don't get C N N which was a big disappointment I used to watch that was my if I wasn't home I'm a college teacher and sometimes I teach in the evening so I'll miss the evening news And you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on C N N I think that really has changed the way I look at the news Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that's same yeah that's when I had it I watched it you know religiously for half an hour and then you could go on you know to do what else you wanted to do Yeah I find I read very little I don't even get a regular newspaper and because I don't drive that much I only live about a mile from where I go to school and work I find I spend so little time in the car that I don't really listen to the radio you know I don't So television is my main new source Uh-huh really to commute to work Oh Yeah I can the van pools I know that and I'm in the Baltimore Washington area and I know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas but if you want a nicer home you know beyond the suburbs you know I that's necessary Yeah I am right outside Baltimore I am less than a mile from the Baltimore line And I go to a campus of the University of Maryland that is just less than a mile from my house So I'm actually in Baltimore yeah you could say I'm in Baltimore really in Baltimore Uh-huh Uh-huh that's a really nice area Bethesda area Uh-huh it's funny there's a big difference between Baltimore and Washington even though they're so close There's only an hour less than that between the two but there is a big difference in things like property values and the closer you get to Washingt- D C the more expensive it is And the different slant Washington it really is an international city where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore You know there's really most people have relocated to the Washington area you know Yeah that's I like it a little bit better too It's interesting though to meet different populations I'm just now + being from Pittsburgh originally I'm just now  meeting different populations like Chinese students and things and I find that really interesting you know to imagine here is somebody that was in China two years ago when all that was going on in Beijing You know that's an interesting perspective But I really much like the hometown area yeah And I think that also goes it's funny you can watch different news I can watch Washington news or Baltimore news and I really do watch Baltimore news You know that really makes I don't really bother with the Washington station because it's so far removed from what I'm interested in Uh-huh yeah it was just a big thing recently they've had some terrible problems with Hispanics they had to impose a curfew in two of the areas in the Washington suburbs The mayor they've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then brought in Yeah and then came a woman that's she's big in the Democratic party so that's good so she has good national ties but she also was something like a state auditor or something like that before this position She was a state auditor I guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia at Washington And then she left that to get a position with the Democratic party and now she ran for mayor so fiscally she's pretty tight and she's cleaning house and it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job for Washington you know which is you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there You know from what I pick up on the news it's a difficult process you know to get rid of a bad mayor Right Uh-huh yeah Yeah but Germantown is a nice area It's a nice area Yeah well they might be car pooling too Do they car pool in Are they driven by themselves Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh They didn't call you for Mother's Day You weren't home Yeah that's good Well I guess we should stop now Uh-huh good so do I I've become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have to discuss are very politically motivated or whatever I really enjoyed it it's so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective It's interesting to see the wider world so I enjoy it Hey thanks a lot and bye
