Well that's something I've thought a lot about I work in a hospital And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients when they asked us did we want to keep it the same or spend more spend less I think right now what they're spending is adequate for my personal opinion because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a vaccine for I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with or I think they already would have by now you know so I don't know if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now I think they're doing as much research as they can possibly do you know And what about you I'm not either I'm definitely not aware of how much that's something I've never really kept up with at all I'm not sure I know I've always thought more about the disease rather than the research you know what I mean And that sort of thing if we were talking about the money I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough simply because I don't know that much about it You know yeah I think so I think so Yeah Yeah Yeah Well that's true That's true because it's such an easily preventable disease  No It's definitely not That's true that's true  Myself I'm or about to get a divorce and course I'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody I can or anything But it's sort of scary to find yourself single again you know And because you never know what's going to happen You don't know who you're going to come across you know Course I'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody I see But it's something you got to think about these days A single person You know and I mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry And Certainly Yeah But I know that in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing you know so that the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything And I don't know I don't think that's a bad idea I know it sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction It just sort of keeps that going But I don't know at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS so far cannot be You know so I don't know I think that's I'm not too much against the passing out of the free syringes myself I don't know what do you think about that It + this "it" needs separate slash mark because B108 is an "aa" with A107 not necesarily the original intended continuation of this utt It  really is It really is They gave us a hard topic Uh-huh That's true That's true Yeah You know I guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have to come first I guess as far as something to do about it so I don't know course there's so many things in the world where if you solve one problem you may be creating another you know so I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse Which is the most important to solve at the time and I don't know but I've never looked into how much money they're spending I have no idea And I know a lot of our tax money goes to that But I really have never looked into it I have no idea Yeah Yeah Right sure Yeah Yeah I think it is I think it is Yeah it does every It seems to take more than for any little thing they do it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would You know But That's one thing I've never really feared I a lot of my family you know they fear me working like that and under some of those conditions but I don't fear it at all I work in the operating room a lot and of course when w-
