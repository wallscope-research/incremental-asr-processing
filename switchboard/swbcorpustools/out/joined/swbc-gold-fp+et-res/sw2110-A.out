I was thinking about whether or not we should have people be required to do public service for a year or two And I was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to I mean you can't make it everybody But then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too And then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members right Give physicals to the rest of the family members and they all had to pass I thought it a good idea too though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money And if they did this maybe help them out in their college cost and maybe they could pay people for doing this at least something so they could subsist Yeah Yeah and you know all these old people they would get out of this right All the ones that are already retired So what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country I'm just teasing Well I thought it would be a good idea if maybe you took some of the kids and had them go over to other countries and children from their countries came over to ours too a trade off Yeah And other than that I can't think of any other ideas with W P A Yeah And we're still using those things too We're still using those things They built lodges before too like at Caddo Lake/ Caddo Lake It's between Texas and Louisiana it crosses into both of them Well it's real pretty it's like a swamp You know with all the Spanish moss on the trees it's eerie Yeah I don't know where are you from Virginia that's neat I talked to somebody from Ohio the other night/ There is somebody and I can't remember who it is but there's a really famous of dang I can't remember That proposed it I read something in PEOPLE about it Huh Mitch Snider I don't know who Mitch Snider is Yeah What have your other topics been I had one that I hated It was what meal would you cook for special dinner How far can you go with that one right Another one though that was good was what do you think about the social changes for the last ten twenty and thirty years and what do you think has caused some of the social problems That's probably the best one And we had to talk about air pollution too/ What do you think is causing it and what should we do about it Uh-huh right Because we don't have much coal In Virginia Yeah well how did you get into this program For T I No So does your company have something to do with T I Huh uh-huh And do you know how long this is supposed to go on I don't either I mean it says just keep on until and they'll notify you At first I was thinking it was just a week because that's all it shows you know on the schedule but then it seems like it might be longer than a week So what do you think we're going to get What do you think we're going to get for this Money prizes Do you know anybody that's ever done this I know T I gets prizes I was led to believe that if you weren't T I that you get money I'm not T I Huh-uh Let's see one of my friends had a roommate that worked for T I and she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat so she ran off copies of the thing And I just signed up for it Yeah Uh-huh And it shouldn't be too good right now anyway because they've been laying off so many people Yeah really so we're footing the bill on our taxes Okay well thanks a bunch we'll talk to you later bye Well I'm going to try to clean up the house after my two children for about an hour see if we can walk around Bye
