Hi Ed Hi  Who wrote that  I see Well that is interesting Right That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that Uh-huh And they have not made a movie of the week of it yet Yeah  Explained listen; could be br Supposedly scooped up by the triangle Yeah Yeah On that same topic have you ever read anything about you know the Amelia Earhart story whatever happened with her I think that would be I am sure there is something out there I thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years Well whatever this is one aspect of it Of course you know it is so weird cause no one will ever really know tha- but it's entertaining and it makes you think about things That is for sure Yeah Right Well I guess I just have not read anyth- I mean usually if I find a good book I will sit you know for two days until it is finished If it's that good and I think the last one I read like that was Scott Thurow's and that was PRESUMED INNOCENT And I just really really liked the way he writes It's just incredible Yeah  That was good I think and the other book I am trying to think you know like was in the last year and I think I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY BON yeah  Yeah I that was really really good the movie was nothing compared to the book And Yeah the movie was a joke compared to I mean because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive when it comes to you know pinpointing society's ills and things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things and so it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie And anyway we are not talking about that but gee I like to read gardening books and things like that Just to tell me what to do with my garden And Yeah Like what is a book on your list you know I have a list too and I have never gotten to it Oh
