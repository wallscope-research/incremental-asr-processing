So do your privacy being invaded at any time Well yo- Right Yeah Yeah Now that you can still yeah I've always done that I started once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse and I say what are you going to do You going to say you don't want to sell me this product then that's fine I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all And then ultimately they say no you don't have to put it down But really it's part of this compliance thing the thing I don't like I know that certain states actually sell their lists like motor vehicles That really burns me because hey you're required You have to do that And nowhere does it asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone And I think that it's one thing to voluntarily give it because someone asks You can always refuse but it's another thing where it's required by law and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody You know I don't think they have the right to do that Well that's easy Whenever you donate money to someone you become put on something like a sucker list and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations And then y- it kind of makes you feel from doing it again Like National Public Radio or any of the public stations you know I think I sent in money f- once to public T V And I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine I it's like and it just started soon after I had done that one And I just said this is terrible and that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old Alma Mater in college And it's one thing they don't sell the list But the thing that makes me mad is then they start getting other people the people do these phonathons and they call you up and they actually happen to be people who graduated in your class or something like that and they say we know you You had contributed x amount last year Can you do better this year And you know like hold on here how do you know that why you even telling me this Is it any of your business I mean it's one thing that I and the college knows that that's just our business There's no need for someone who is soliciting should know at all Just and that was very offensive too I and so <> Uh-huh Right
