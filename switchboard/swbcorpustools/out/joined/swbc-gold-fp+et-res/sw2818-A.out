Okay I do have friends that have children yes They I think that's correct There relatively nonexistent from what I hear from my friends It seems like even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if I can use that word still you have to deal with the people that you know happen to be operating it locally and it's just a matter of trust you know I think they feel that these people are under qualified basically and underpaid and I think that sort of goes hand in hand so it's difficult for them Huh-uh Huh-uh Huh-uh Right Right Huh-uh Huh-uh Huh-uh Huh-uh I'm sure that's true Huh-uh Right Right I do have a friend that she and her roommate became live-in care givers and they loved it They had stayed with this family from the time these children were small you know four or five years old up until they were well into grade school And she was paid very well because the parents trusted them and they you know had done such a good job So I can see where someone you know in a position like that in a live-in capacity would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the financial to be able to do that Yeah Yeah I think it's just a matter of priorities you know it's a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way but you still have to be realistic as well I think Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah And that's bad to have to admit too but you know it's just there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home and I think that is one reason why I continue to be without children I it's just such a responsibility and when I've had friends that have said when you hear people say it alters your life forever please take heed well I realize that's true so it's such a responsibility Huh-uh yeah Huh-uh Yeah Most of the time Yeah sure Sure Sure Sure Right Right Right Right But you know it's funny I had a friend that said you know before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other and she got older and she said but you know we never do those things anyway So why am I waiting you know it's just the way your attitude changes and you mature I suppose But the thing about the child care you know I have friends that struggle financially and they both do have to work It's a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he as well but you know they need the money And when I seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know to someone else it's just I can imagine how emotional it must be you know multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person or you're uncomfortable with the situation as far as child care it's just a scary thing Huh-uh That's a big plus Right Right Huh-uh Yeah Huh-uh Right Right Right Yeah Huh-uh Huh-uh I think it takes a I don't know I think your patient level needs to increase as the child gets older I think that might be part of the problem with some people You know taking care of a baby I know is not an easy thing but when you have them in their little feet are moving and you have to chase them down constantly I'm sure that's a whole new ball game really Well you sound like your pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about since they're both in school you don't have to worry about a full-time person to take care of them <> That's something altogether different Huh-uh of course not You can't do that No No No That's out of the question I'm sure Right Right Right Right Huh-uh That's amazing It's amazing that people actually the stamina that you must you know draw from yourself to deal with it It must be interesting I guess you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought maybe Huh-uh Now it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly I'm sure Well are your children now do you feel comfortable with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home or No Yeah Huh-uh Yeah Yeah That's just a difference in kids I suppose Yeah Huh-uh yeah and it's the one that's going downhill is it the one that needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or more mature one Yeah How unfortunate Well I'm living in a dream world what do I know As I said I don't have kids and I'm an only child so I've never been around children So I'm sort of at a loss where that's concerned But I do hear my friends talk about it Huh-uh Yeah That's like World War Three every minute I don't know I have to admit I was selfish as a child I didn't want a brother or sister And now that I'm older of course it's different You know I think about wouldn't it be nice but anyway Yeah I have wonderful friends That's true my best friend is one child of ten And so they just sort of you know adopted me as their eleventh child so that worked out pretty well She never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them so I guess that's an alternative If you could just have a whole bunch By the time the youngest ones are there you'll have older one to take care of them I don't know When you see all these horror stories on television about child care and gosh I just I was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that's been telling her mother these terrible stories and of course people are denying it And it's just frightening It really is Huh-uh Huh-uh Yeah Huh-uh Huh-uh
