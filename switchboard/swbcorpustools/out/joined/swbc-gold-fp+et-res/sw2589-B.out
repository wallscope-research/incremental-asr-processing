The public school systems well everybody's has known they've needed renovation for years but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it The first direction that or I would love to see them go with Kids learn at different rates and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together You'd learn at this rate and that's the only way it's going to happen You've got some kids that'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it and the other fifty-seven minutes you've been talking about a subject you've bored them The educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person Out of each child Some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff Other kids are going to be really into math some are really going to be heavy into reading Instead of pushing the scales too far either direction I mean it's great to be well rounded and be exposed to all this stuff But why not hit the points the kid's really interested in Because if he's interested he's going to study it and he's going to learn it and he's going to remember it They need exposure to every subject They don't need to be masters of it Everything I learned about ancient Rome has not helped me anywhere in my adult life what type of history class is it that you're having to take Well the early ones they could actually combine two levels of it the one from seventeen hundred til say the end of the Civil War Combine that into one And then from eighteen sixty-five to present and make that your second step because to a point you know the early parts of it you're giving the foundations of the nation but even then they're skimming over they're almost trivial with it You know I mean if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter I mean they make all these people out to be they were great men and they're the father of the country and all this He had just as much dirt on him as anybody else If not more The man was not a saint if the isolation concept really works that good why are our prisons overcrowded as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that lev- the public school system I want to see changed too When I was brought up if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough you were going to get spanked Well then the extreme came in and now we can no longer spank them so we now isolate them Okay we've swung the pendulum both ways Let's find a middle ground there has to be some sort of discipline and there has to be some sort of punishment Short of physically isolating the child and short of physically hitting the child Let's put him into a situation where okay you crossed the line you broke the rule you're going to have to pay for it But it's going to tax you physically I mean instead have them pick up around the school yard have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school yar- Do something to beautify the school property But you cut you know the kid's having to give up his quote play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong But he's seeing something constructive come out of it I think that not only applies inside the public school system but in society itself there's been too much negative reinforcement How much like the caught being good slips How about just the John Q citizen out there on the street I most wholeheartedly agree I mean there's a point of over kill but somewhere you've got to find an even line Need that shock effect where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked
