So let's see what was the topic I forgot we are supposed to talk Yeah do you have any children did you Where did you go Clarion I mean if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place or Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I know I kind of feel the same way I just finished college a couple years ago and I you know it was while I had my family and everything and it was a lot harder but you know I went to a college that was fairly local and I feel like my education you know you get out of it what you put into it I think But you know I know it's some people are real adamant about you know going to a certain school or whatever I do not know I guess a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something I do not know But But Uh-huh Yeah Is that why you picked the school you did or Uh-huh Yeah Yeah So you lived there at school then You lived there at school Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh And that was for tuition and Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh For business So are you working somewhere then or I see where are you going to move to are you Do you have friends there or I see So does he work for a company down there I see the big company So yeah I have been working for T I for about twelve years I guess So But I am originally from Illinois but you know I have gone to college I guess a few different places but I think you know for the most part you know the teachers have been pretty good and I have got out of it what I have put into it but you know I think that's most of it personally but that's why you know with my kids I think that you know I am just going to encourage them to go And I am going to try to help them financially but I think you know financially I am there's only so much I can do for them and I will say here's what you have got you can either you know go a couple of years locally and you know then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it But otherwise you can just go for four years you know somewhere and I will try to help you But I do not know you know the financial end of it like you said I put my wife through school too Of course T I paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff but it still was a challenge to do so I think you know financially that's one of the big aspects You know you Right Yeah Well since you were paid for school yourself do you think you had a different outlook on it like your grades and things like that Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh yeah Yeah Right Yeah Well see I think you know I have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it and I guess it depends on the way you are raised too but if you grow to expect that you know you kind of go there as sort of a vacation you know I that's the way a lot of my friends did it and you know they did not take it very serious I know I took it real serious 'cause I did not start to college until you know I was about eight or ten years you know out of what I should have been in school you know so I think that helped me be real serious about it And I ended up graduating with like a three point six Yeah so I you know and that was hard cause I had two kids and you know a family and everything else so I had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time But Yeah you are right exactly Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Right Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right Right Well my wife was sort of in the same situation she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go for and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it But you know by then she had practically got her degree so so you know Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I think you are right when you pull yourself away and then you get out and you say man I really need this
