So do you happen to be working for a large firm Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh I work for a fairly large company It's got eight thousand people And we do have health insurance We don't have four O one K plan stuff like that but we do have like retirement They kind of match up to you if you put six percent they match up to six percent and then the rest is whatever you want to put in If you put more than that or something like that It's not bad God I don't know It's probably a long time I'm sure it's not till like twenty-five years thirty years Yeah well I guess what we have is what they call a flex benefits plan where you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need Otherwise guess you can hold money back and then either use or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or can just have that money you know put in your paycheck Yeah <> well it depends on which company you work for I know that like the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is you know think you call it plan D Deductibles are really high it's like fifteen hundred dollars but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because if you're relatively healthy then it's really unlikely that you'd use that amount of money you know So you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and take a loss whatever it happens to be if you happen to be a healthy individual  Really You mean not even your car insurance that's too bad Yeah well I don't know I think other than health insurance I think you know an extra week of time off would be nice I only get two weeks that's nice We don't get them till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week Yeah it's with the telecommunications type of company supposedly you used to be much more stable It's a lot less stable than it used to be They used to have job security crap but now they don't Yeah it's the Bell Corps which is Yeah So I don't know it's no longer So that's what I think it's still based on the old model of and now they don't Yeah Yeah but they no longer I don't think so hearing a lo- they're always laying people off which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security I don't know we haven't been doing layoffs We've been doing down sizing with getting rid of extra layers of management And I don't know what they do for those people Some of it yeah There's too many chiefs and not enough Indians but
