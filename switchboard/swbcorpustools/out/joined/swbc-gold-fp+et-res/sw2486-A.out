Well I am basically retired now I was a member I was in education and in administration so basically I wore dresses slash And heels and I because my work often took me into court never was one that got accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work But that was just me I know many people are very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants it I guess I was just old enough not to be very comfortable in it How about you Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes And I think that does make a difference because when you do have to be in front of people I think the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and more classical style of clothing What about the mini skirt We- Uh-huh Well there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts There are some that are really short and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person as well as the shape of the person's legs Now I also even though I retired from education I do modeling and I teach at a modeling agency here so when we are doing wardrobing and we have two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job even though I may have them from sixth grade on up through grandmothers in my class And I always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad because maybe those are not the clothes that are the most appealing to you or the most complimentary to you But the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want and then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy That's right Well I have to agree with that even when they was very very popular in the early sixties I again maybe because I was at the school there were still many teachers who wore mini skirts we had no regulation against it and a lot of the kids did of course and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers Because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts And so I think of course now I go the other extreme I do not like to see in the corporate areas all the women dressed like men with the suits and white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same I don't like that I don't I think there should be individuality in dressing Yes Right and I  don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to look professional I think that you make of that what you wish and you can go the opposite direction and over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which don't belong at least in my opinion in the work place but that you can have a classical look without a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine Because that was one thing I always fought against I started out as a physical education teacher So I was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish and people would never ever guess that I was Phys Ed and that pleased me and so then I of course just continued what I considered the best style of clothing for me at work and I find even at home here now  I I  will wear blue jeans or I'll wear shorts and what have you and be very comfortable but when I go out somewhere then unless I have a pair of dress slacks I don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans I have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how And so I just feel that you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort But there are certain norms that companies should be able to put out as guidelines for their employees Right Yes Yes That's good Yeah uh-huh Yes Right Right right Yeah Yeah well I don't either Fortunately I don't have to work in those companies But I did have a group come over from one of the banks over the children's hospital where I was volunteering and they were doing a presentation and every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly a like men and women They all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie I mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants need slash And one was a skirt and one was a pant sd and I think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality That can stifle creativity So I guess so well it's been nice talking with you Uh-huh bye bye
