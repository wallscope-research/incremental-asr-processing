Well I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic God No why don't you go first Well let me ask a personal question how old are you well then you should see over thirty-five everything goes downhill flop you're lucky then because I've battled arthritis all my life I mean even since I was like about two or three Then they diagnosed it and usually most people are just absolutely crippled and I do water aerobics Religiously do water aerobics I used to do it about six times a week and now I'm down to about four but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in there I tried weight training and I'm telling you I just can't lift the things And the shock on the system is just too much so I have stuck to water aerobics basically you know the weightless thing and trying to keep this shape that way but you know it's hard to find I mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what I'm finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are I think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way to get in shape without having to spend anything or it's the geriatric crowd So I've considered even becoming licensed to teach it Yeah but you have to have an indoor pool So to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without you know drawing a lot of looks means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity you look very odd in the water that was the one place where I was also able to do weight training and that does look very odd in the water No and you know that's the only place I haven't tried and people have told me Now that's the Texins facility I have been told that thing is just lovely Huh He- do you use that facility a lot Huh Do you know if they have child care there They don't I don't work at T I No I used to work at T I as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position actually when I was working there I was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry and I used to fill out those attitude surveys and me and the insurance adjusters are very familiar with each other and my husband still works there and I get my attitude expressed through them but I find it to be very sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot mentality to save a few bucks and never having lived in Texas before I starting working for T I and I came down here and you know they did an attitude survey like six weeks after I had been working here and I asked about you know day care for the shift workers and boy I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that you know it was not applicable to me and I was kind of horrified We're talking nineteen seventy-eight They couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages I understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care and the reason I'm at home is when I had my kids and I was scheduled to go back I tell you how much in the dark ages it was I had been rated number one in the field and then I took when I became pregnant I also got meningitis and then delivered the first baby three months early and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment Sure And then they used to and then I had a second one eighteen months later they told me to put them back to back and of course to maintain and I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one because that's when I go into labor four and a half months and I don't even know it yeah very easy very easy and they put me on twenty-four hour fetal monitoring then to try to control the labor and see how far it was going and after the baby was born since it wasn't premature then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor I think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof because it was a thirteen thousand dollar bill but after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work and that was when they had God it would have been the eighty-five layoff and I'll tell you how they handled this and I was just outraged I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been terminated until I filed my insurance claims about four months later and they didn't have any coverage under my name and I went back and I said what the hell is going on here you know And they told me well you know you know your husband works here and he's got a good salary we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway and you know we've got people here that really you know need to be working and so that we had just you know it was this way we didn't have to layoff an active person and we'd just let you go And it took me about a year of arguing I said you know I've got to put this in writing to me because until they put it in writing I couldn't get my insurance benefits and I couldn't get my termination benefits either I was just pissed as hell that they could do that But I guess things have gotten better I've been told that this flex hour and those kind of things I still don't think that after my experiences that they could you know get me to go back ever again But let me ask you this since you use Texans how much is it a month Now that's for individual That's it Now if you pay your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes your taking God that's cheap That's really cheap Do you have to be an active T I employee to join Texans Or a depe- God I am so dependent these days It's a sense seen that my co-dependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence Yeah So my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment but boy I think I'm going to go contact Texans I really think I am I mean that beats any offer I've heard in a long time Huh All righty When you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty I'm actually right on the Plano line Yeah God it sounds like I would I might do that then Okay I learned something here You can go back to work now Thank you Bye-bye
