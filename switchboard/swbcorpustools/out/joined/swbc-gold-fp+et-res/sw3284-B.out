yes I think so Yeah I don't kn- Yeah I believe that's right and I don't know that that's really what we're talking about Yeah for kids in high school it could be in the summertime you know it could even be done while they're doing you know a job to make money But it's you know such a grassroots idea that it I think the family would have to be involved in it And people would have to be convinced that you know I think the basic message is that giving is better than receiving And that's not the kind of society we have right now There's lots and lots of volunteer programs but at least it's my opinion that most of those involve adults Adults who have the time to give and you know the desire to give you know it's not maybe it cou- younger people feel like it's not open to them I don't know But it should be if it's not Yeah it is kind of an introspective time of life But some high schools have actually started like a visitation program to you know say less advantaged areas And they promote service on the part of the kids to some of those people So at least that's a step in the right direction I guess it's really unfortunate because when you do I do volunteer work for the American Lung Association And I have gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society And there's no question that you know doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than the people involved it's really a gift to yourself and I think that's a really important lesson to learn and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not really happy you know Because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself you're just kind of down the tube you know it really is better to give then to receive
