I guess this is a topic near and dear to my heart since I am a healthy eater Well I there really isn't any kind of particular food that I don't like really and I like a good Italian restaurant or a good especially like good prime rib so it's nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that and I live here in Rome New York and there are a lot of good restaurants around here Uh-huh Uh-huh Really no I'm in upstate New York and it's actually very inexpensive I there's a place half a mile from me here that has fantastic prime rib for eleven dollars for a whole meal you know a potato and salad and soup and the whole nine yards so that Right I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever had so I'll have to go there when I get to Dallas Uh-huh sure Uh-huh No no I'm don't do the raw fish like that but I do like like like a raw bar like oysters and things like that they I go on I'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business so I find myself down in Melbourne Florida about once every two months or so and go and hit the oyster bars down there quite a bit but I love that Yeah and Maryland's great you get the crabs it's like I can't go anywhere where I don't enjoy myself so That's true Yeah well it's really strange that seafood is so expensive because in reality I say that the oceans have the greatest resource of food on the planet and yet we as human beings haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically so we managed to figure out how to get at just about everything else but not seafood Yeah yeah I make a wicked chili and around here the big spicy thing is like buffalo wings and so they you know you go out to get the chicken wings and those are really hot and the hotter the better Right Sure Yeah Uh-huh my scalp will start I can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot the weirdest weirdest sensation almost like a tingling but I don't know but yeah well there isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like Things that are kind of oddball like Thai cuisine I never been really fond of that stuff You talk about spicy that'll literally blow your head off it's so hot and I can handle just about any kind of food without well but that stuff goes one notch beyond my tolerances So Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the service in a restaurant is always nice though too that's one thing What's that Yeah Well I find that lately that so many people are you know working waitressing jobs or waiter
