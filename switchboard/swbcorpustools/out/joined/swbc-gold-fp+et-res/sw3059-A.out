Okay the last movie that I have seen it's been a couple of months I saw SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY and FLATLINERS Those were the last two that I've seen FLATLINERS Oh it was just well someone had I had seen the advertisement for FLATLINERS on T V and I thought I'd like it and then one of my friends who went to see SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY she told me to go It was good So that's why I saw that one No I haven't gotten to see you know any real recent ones I like comedies better than I do dramas Uh-huh Did you care for SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY Uh-huh Uh-huh well I didn't care for the movie myself I didn't really care for the movie either Yeah uh-huh Well okay on likewise then did you see PRETTY WOMAN Do you enjoy that one Uh-huh I haven't even heard of that one Uh-huh yeah Well I really liked PRETTY WOMAN You know I just well you just kind of went with it Like you said you had to accept the beginning of it and just kind of go Yeah But FLATLINERS now it's a drama and I don't usually like them and I really enjoyed it I don't know it was kind of it made you think a lot I think Did you see GHOST Okay now did you care for that one Uh-huh See now I didn't I thought it was an okay movie but it wasn't something that I would enjoy seeing twice or three times I didn't think so I really didn't care for the ending of it I thought it was just of like you didn't know this was going to happen when you know but I don't know you know Well of course a bunch of girls had told me and warned me and they said it's a real tearjerker" and da da da da da Meanwhile I sat through the movie and said well when are you supposed to start crying you know I didn't really find it to be a tearjerker if I see them more than once I see them on video I never pay to see one more than once You know But like you said I enjoy the comedies a lot better In fact that's where I've seen most of my movies have been on video You see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen Uh-huh Yeah uh-huh yeah Uh-huh No I saw one it was a drama also and I can't think of the name of it now that it was a book before it came out in a movie and it was a drama It wasn't a comedy No I wanted to see that I didn't get to really Uh-huh Well what movies are showing down there now Yeah that's pretty much what I do I know for sure that that one about what was that one about Bob I think it's just Yeah I think it's just playing now up here
