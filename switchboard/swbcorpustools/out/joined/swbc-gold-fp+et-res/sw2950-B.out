Certainly the weather here is warm And it has been sort of raining on and off And I am an avid gardener so I measure the rain in our rain gauge on a regular basis So I can avoid wasting money on watering but it has been threatening to rain for the last couple of days and it has not really Which is a bit of a disappointment But it is very warm here which is typical for this time of the year How about Pennsyl- It starts in March as a rule Really this late Could you have snow well we do not have that problem that is nice well I will be glad to give you some of ours Usually we get it in great quantities in April and May And then it stops for three months Right Uh-huh Are you in an agricultural area Well I know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of the land Uh-huh Uh-huh  Well you know there are some disadvantages to being down south And that is it gets so hot that you know a lot of things die during the Summer from the heat they really do and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered Yeah Well my parents are now in San Diego and they've got pebbles in their yard because almost nobody there has lawns Yeah it is very rough on them so Actually I think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas Because the Summers are extremely hot what is your humidity like I do not know what it is percentage wise but I Yeah it is drier in Dallas than it is in Houston or San Antonio or even Austin which is further south But it is not dry and I have lived here for many years and I think it has gotten more humid over the years Where the water is coming from I don't know does he live near the lake Uh-huh  Uh-huh that is a problem they tell you when you are looking for a house or buying land to build on to be very careful and check the drainage because it is deceptive And I know exactly what you mean Uh-huh well that is fortunate Uh-huh Well I like it here I grew up here I have lived other places but I did grow up here and this is very much home for me And I hope you visited during the winter one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter and well I go to cool places during the Summer if I can anyway sure I mean I had a friend from England visit once at Christmas and we could not get her out of the what she called the <> back garden Because she wanted to go back with a sunburn And she went back to the north of England with a sunburn Well yeah basically I do too Well that is really healthier frankly Uh-huh That But you know it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot Now my sister is a sun fiend And she is five years younger than me she is more wrinkled Yeah and I think that is why Exactly I think it burns off the I don't know the scientific principle But it burns something off the natural oils or something like that Yes Yes that sounds like the right theory Good Well that is great it has been very nice here too And I hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening and I want them to have nice weather for their visit instead of driving around in the rain probably four or five days Well thank you Thanks Yeah And the same to you A pleasure I am sure I will in fact if I had not been preparing for the out of town visitors I probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days Well I am glad you have broken the ice with me because now I will start doing it Okay Well thanks Jean Bye-bye
