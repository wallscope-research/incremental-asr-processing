Uh-huh Really Yeah I feel that my I'm a junior in college now And I go to Tech Georgia Tech And I Okay I've the high school I went to was a good one also And well I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools Because the one I went to was you know I'm sure a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta Yeah What d- Yeah that's true Yeah And I'm also I mean in those places where like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that More than they would you know in areas where they yeah Uh-huh Yeah That's true Right Yeah That's hard for me to say since I didn't really grow well when I went to elementary school it wasn't in a great area but started learning to read when I was in kindergarten you know So I guess I can't say what it would be like to grow up in a really oppressed region You know I guess the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people So I guess the thing to do is to try to get some kind of motivation to learn and Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh No I can't say that I have either But Yeah I mean I've heard statistics and things that compare a public education to a private education I mean like within the same income groups If you compare like the people that could have sent their kids to private schools and you know the people that did send their kids to private schools I think they compare you know fairly well Yeah my schools I mean there I have a lot of once it seemed I got into high school they had a lot of accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that I mean that makes a big difference cause I wondered when they're taking classes with people that are interested in the subject and stuff like that Uh-huh
