All right Ron Total gun control Yes I agree something should be done but I don't believe there is any way of total control over weapons because crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct will have access to weapons from somewhere and that means they'll always have an advantage over us and they may even get worse because they know we have nothing to support myself Now you know I agree with a lot of the things you just said in your few moments because personally I used to be a great hunter and in the last few years I've said no way Matter of fact if I find a fly running around in the house I pick him up and carry him outdoors I don't even hit him with a flyswatter so I've gotten over this business of wanting to go out and shooting and killing and that sort of thing But I think personally that we do need some weapons available to most of the people Most of the people really are honest and worthy of carrying on their lives properly I'm sort of in line thinking in terms I don't see anything wrong with this five day waiting period if the waiting period is utilized to really look at the background of the person purchasing the weapon I mean there's nothing wrong with that Do you see anything wrong with that Right Yeah I'm against this automatic and semiautomatic stuff I don't think we should have access to those No Huh <> Yes And the people should be selected so that we know that they are all right and that they're not acquiring weapons for illicit use that is not good There's nothing wrong with a person that enjoys the mechanisms As a matter of fact there's a fellow out there working on my house right now who brought to me a target from a rifle that he pretty well halfway designed and he put together the the bullets in it and he was showing me that at a hundred yards he kept five shots within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards Now see from a technical point of view that is something that our military people need to know about So there are other interesting facets in guns and weapons This is a bolt action rifle I think he has And he has done other things to the way the barrel sits in the wood part of it And he designed the bullets themselves and he has fantastic accuracy just from a technical point of view that interests me Not to kill anybody with it or anything with it but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh
