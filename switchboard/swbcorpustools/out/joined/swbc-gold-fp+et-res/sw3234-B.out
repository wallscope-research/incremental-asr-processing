Oh Well it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society my  Uh-huh Well my children are the ones that wanted our pet and this one is probably the best one that we have had as I say we got it from the Humane Society and we had lost a pet and we really went there looking for the one that we had lost It got out under the fence while we were on vacation and we just looked all over for it and couldn't find it but when we walked in to the Humane Society this little dog was in the office and would sit up and beg and just he was so cute and the kids just fell in love with it We just couldn't leave without it But whoever had it before must have trained it real well because you know it's a good house dog I've never had one that I could keep in the house before and tolerate it Uh-huh Uh-huh It's hard to do that when you're not there constantly  Oh  Oh About the only time we have well I shouldn't say the only time but most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night and she usually stays inside at night We try to take her out right before we go to sleep but sometimes it doesn't work Uh-huh Oh What a cute idea Well we got one one year for Christmas and I had a baby the next day and so that one wasn't really well trained I just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time so Yeah I thin- it was it really was The older kids had wanted one though and you know we thought well that would be a fun time for them to you know get it at Christmas time It was a little Spitz wi- a little white fluffy and you know looked like it came right from the north pole and that was fun but I sure wasn't good at training it I think you have to have time you know to do those things That's right
