Okay I think we're supposed to discuss our view of the Soviet Union as a continuing threat to the United States How do you feel about that I'm concerned about them not as a military threat but as a burden They're very large and they can become very quickly a large financial burden as one more stepchild we have to carry around <> And they have a problem their whole attitude I'm not sure which crop it was but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to harvest it And the people in the city were saying well why should I go do that Make the government do that that's not my job Absolutely and I think that they're having a hard time with the concept of you can not go back <> People only go forward and I think that that is giving them I'm expecting a call and unfortunately I think it's come through I've enjoyed talking to you Thank you bye
