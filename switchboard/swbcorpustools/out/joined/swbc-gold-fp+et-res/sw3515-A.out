we do here see what do we recycle they recycle they have bins and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and plastic bottles and I think that's all they have What about you guys Uh-huh Really For smashed cans Uh-huh can you hold on for just a minute I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that I pressed it hard enough because okay just succeed okay well I guess Yeah Okay well anyways you guys only get a penny a can Well when you buy like canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit Yeah Exactly and so it's like they charge you for the deposit so when you turn in the cans unsmashed you're just like reimbursed Type of thing That's sort of nice though Uh-huh Yeah so you guys can actually get ahead But they have sort of like things that you're not like reimbursed for or paid for Like we can recycle clear glass brown glass green glass and milk jugs and newspapers you know everyone does newspapers But that kind of stuff But they said they can't be smashed or else it doesn't fit in their little containers and they're not reimbursed by the people who are over them or something Yeah Exactly yeah send it to this address no But let's see they said that ways can encourage recycling Yeah that's Uh-huh As likely to do it Yeah Yeah that's true Uh-huh Yeah Yeah exactly Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh that's good another thing I thought of I guess to recycle would be like clothes because I mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other And one way that we do it sort of in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops And that way you know you don't get near enough as much as you bought it for but you got the use out of it and what you're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for And so that's something that I've never we're new to Iowa so that's something that I hadn't you know looked into before But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle I guess
