a lot of companies now are using drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to root out the either elementary or intermediate or advanced drug users And I know the government you know gives drug tests to all new applicants coming into government and I quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it I guess I'm not a good civil libertarian and I feel you know that if you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background Of course we're being involved in my organization we have deep background checks but sometimes you know drug use can escape that And I have absolutely no compunction about using any and all means to you know figure out or who has a drug problem and putting that guy into therapy to you know break this activity Of course if he's fallen in love with drugs and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope What's your feeling Uh-huh Well I think the first morphine laws were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that Yeah Well the thing of it is that is in many respects you know just I think an over simplification I think there's so much criminal activity that people go into to support drug habits Yeah You know they support drug habits you know with things like you know burglary or prostitution or stuff like that yeah I must admit that Yeah Yeah I must admit that the production costs of these drugs are zippo compared to the street market costs and the costs to society yeah But I think that you know being in law enforcement you know I probably have a kind of a draconian Philistine attitude toward it but I really feel as though the interdiction effort is as soon as you get rid of one goon that's involved in drugs and tha- Yeah and then another one will jump up But we see Yeah as soon as we wind up you know for well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand but people want to get stoned and I don't see that Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh
