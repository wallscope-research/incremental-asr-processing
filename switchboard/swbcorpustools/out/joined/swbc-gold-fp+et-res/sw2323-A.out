Well I guess I'm maybe naive but I never did feel that Russia was a big threat to us I mean obviously  there's the possibility of or was  the possibility of war but I somehow think that war is one of those things that maybe is inevitable but I don't look at it as a threat in the same sense that I think this question was meant What about you Yes Uh-huh Right Right Yeah Right Right Right Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh But I guess there was concern that Iraq would use you know nonconventional warheads with the chemical weapons and things but yet it didn't happen I mean why not Uh-huh so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from using it But yet the Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right I don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet I think that's not very likely But yet you know as the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people And I guess that makes sense what you said that within their own borders they feel freer to do what they feel necessary Yeah Uh-huh Right Well or that it resolves anything in the end that negotiations couldn't resolve Uh-huh <> Well it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the U S Right Right Uh-huh Right right Okay well thanks Bye-bye
