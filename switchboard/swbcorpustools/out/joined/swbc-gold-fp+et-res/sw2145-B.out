Well I guess I would first identify myself as middle aged and therefore having seen the last generation I guess it you know gives me a perspective on that I am quite positive on the things that I have seen happen recently relative to women both in society and in the work place there's no doubt about the fact that when I was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily now I think the change that I've seen as much as anything is one where couples are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place And I guess that's a significant change that I've both participated in and noticed Uh-huh Wonder about them in what way Uh-huh Uh-huh I have not to be honest had much experience with children in that situation I guess one knows one's own storly and I know in my children's case it was one where pretty much up until the older of two was let's see I guess basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force  so I guess my experience is just with what we did and so they didn't really go through the child care route They were able to be home together and we never actually experienced that in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the next generation or so I guess I anticipate an increasing equality greater presence of women in management roles I don't know whether there will be an increased amount of surrogacy that we see I just don't know deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother Sort of rent-a-mom you know not to be crass about it but whether one might conceive no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of a professional mother person For instance that and you know I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting story or whatever I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that In fact I think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession I don't have other than a reading and male perspective on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not my sense is that I have very much an interest and had one in being a parent I don't know that I felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs I don't have boys that didn't bother me never has Vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or as a professional nanny as you put it Maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of say taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care It would be a sort of day care but it would be more of a family setting I know that there are young people characterized I guess as being half my age so by definition that means they're young in my work place who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child I could easily envision that Pardon Or to put their child into a home setting where you know like they would leave at eight in the morning and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and you were paying for really high quality care I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures on the order of what I quoted to someone because that's the experience they want and I would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years Uh-huh uh-huh I haven't ever really looked at them Are you aware at all of what they cost Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in American society That's okay too Uh-huh I'm noticing that too and I notice a terming emerging called solo parents that I'm very aware of the number of solo mothers that I encounter in the work place and that is a little troublesome because the pressures on them are rather formidable and maybe that's a change we'll see Maybe the possibility of women who deliberately say no we'll let the man take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever So Well I think we're about done Okay good-bye You take care Bye
