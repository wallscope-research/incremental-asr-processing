Okay my name is Karen Okay and this they said about magazines I've probably personally take I think just two but that's because my mother-in-law takes every one they print and gives them to me a month later So I get all of them the one that I really especially enjoy and you may be familiar with it from Wisconsin is called COUNTRY Well this yeah this one is the one they have all the pictures of scenery from places we wished we live like Wisconsin Gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things And I get that it has recipes in it and that's my very favorite What do you take Uh-huh Yeah decorating Uh-huh Are you Oh And decorating and how to do things Uh-huh Yeah Well we tried for a while to take a news magazine We took NEWSWEEK and I think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and have it be digested But we've kind of discontinued that right now and we're going to start taking that U S NEWS newspaper U S A TODAY I think it Yeah Uh-huh That's right That's exactly right I did the same thing We saved the ones from the election and we saved the ones from the war and one from the earthquake And then and Uh-huh Uh-huh Well you sound like you That's the thing you sound like you have the facilities to do that Oh Oh I bet it is gorgeous I agree Uh-huh Yeah right Every page I do the same thing I think I opened VOGUE the other day or something and it was just nothing uh-huh And I thought Why buy this You know what's the point That's right And my number one pet peeve in a magazine is when they put the perfume in it because real often I don't like very heavy perfumes and very often like you know in my bills also magazines and bills and they'll come out just stinking the whole thing Uh-huh Oh I understand Well do you tear out of your magazines your recipes or do you keep it Uh-huh Type it out uh-huh See how the family liked it that's a good idea Well I'm going to pay attention more when I'm in the store to that COUNTRY LIVING I remember seeing the cover Back when I decorated the house with a lot of the little country primitive things the little pigs and the ducks and that that was the big rage here couple of years ago And I bought a lot of the country magazines and then it seems like when I put some of that away I quit buying it but I had forgotten the recipes and I'm going to I'll have to check that out Uh-huh And you don't want to part with any of them because there's one thing in each one that's good Uh-huh right Right I know
