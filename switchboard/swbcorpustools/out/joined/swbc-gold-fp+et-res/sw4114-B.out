it's pretty good you know You get closer to the coast here and you do get a good bit of smog and stuff especially from all the fuel cracking towers and chemical plants Yeah it's when you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial but I'm about thirty miles west of there so you have actually green trees and such that you don't notice that other part of New Jersey exists Actually very you know you go even a few miles out and you got farms and everything so you relatively clear air But definitely It's you know there are a large number of them on the road They're all you know going and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year You get the car that's in the accident and muffler falls off or something and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that Yeah that and I think also some of the car companies are coming out with gas powered fleets so you natural gas powered rather than gasoline it is coming from cars though I mean the car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of the freon Which is one of the major fluorocarbons Well it No it's the type of thing there that you know the Third World countries are less industrial and they want to become industrial so they're on the different part of the cycle of the U S The U S used you know all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to where we got to Yeah No Well you also have the very close related thing of the rain forest destruction which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants I've mostly been in the east coast so that's going between Atlanta D C area A- Well not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the inversion and Los Angeles and rest of California which is just terrible it sounds Uh-huh Yeah Yeah there it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of heavy industry you know that would be causing it Uh-huh
