Yeah Right that it I a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not depend so much on the emotions of a particular case but be able to put it in overall perspective Well I certainly haven't thought much about this but Yes yes some of them do and some of them don't but this one I was trying to remember back It seems to me that you know when I studied civics in school or stuff that the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't so much And I'm trying to figure out whether I'm remembering wrong or whether that's by state Yeah Yeah And I guess and I don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some supreme court decision perhaps that said that that as part of the trial by the peers that had to include the sentencing or too or whatever I yeah but yeah I certainly wouldn't be worried about that I guess in terms of you know having a judge do it would seem to me to be more fair and unbiased in terms of doing away with the unanimous jury I guess I would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in the trial system that's just such a tradition that it's got to be a unanimous jury that I don't know where you'd draw the line anywhere else you know two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever But and I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a bare majority  Yeah Yeah Yeah whatever Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Well and I'm I I'd I know it is where I work But I'm not sure that that's necessarily required you know by law that it has to be paid I suspect that's a benefit of a bigger company but there are certainly some that wouldn't yeah
