So interesting political trends or events Well I guess the most interesting one that's going on right now from my perspective is this phenomena of Ross Perot caught his interview last night with David Frost and it was the first time I had you know heard his views expressed by himself I had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in But the whole phenomena of him coming out of literally nowhere and no party at least no apparent party support on either side is pretty interesting Uh-huh Like out of nowhere Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Well it seems that the decision so far has been filtered by you know party politics so much that when the candidates finally get party approval party support and therefore get presented to the public the candidates are already beyond what most public feels is acceptable behavior You know the one of the common criticisms of Clinton is gee he'll say or do anything in order to get to the White House and up and to the point of Perot being a serious candidate it seems like that was a requirement of being a contender within the party is to have done all those things I mean here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward you know getting the party nomination and preparing himself for the presidency and now it seems like both he and the incumbent President are you know pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of a whole nonpolitical arena Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah and yet even he was a consummate politician in the sense that not only did he fail in business twice with bankruptcy and failure but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one and the first and only election he won was the presidency he had lost every other office that he had you know he was appointed a couple of times to like state legislator Yeah then when he finally you know did win an election you know it was the presidency Yeah Yeah But Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh
