Hi My name's Ken And you're in Texas right Everybody's in Texas God I'm in Rochester New York Everybody else but one has been in Texas Okay well I guess we should get on with this did you get the message about what it was right Okay go ahead I'm going to hit the button Okay do you think that the Soviet Union represents a threat to us That's interesting I don't I suspect they're not our biggest threat anymore I suspect it's probably some crazy man like Saddam Hussein who's our biggest threat but I wonder how much of a threat they are I agree with you that they'll always be somewhat of a threat given that it's just so big and there's just so much military machine there Right But I wonder how much longer they're going to be them Yeah Yeah I agree I mean if something were to happen I'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of unity against us or something if need be But Yeah actually I noticed this most recent scare of his where or he just decided that I can't think of the word now if there are any demonstrations in favor of Boris Yeltsin he decided well I'll just cancel all demonstrations altogether So I think that he's actually he I think is becoming very dangerous because he's making those people angry at him and I think he's also making the military angry at him I mean I've heard stories now where the military is running around and they're sort of getting restless and a restless military is the kind of thing that happens you know like with the Baltic states when they just go in there divvy the people up Uh-huh That's interesting I wonder I don't know if he's he seems the thing about Gorbachev strikes that he wouldn't be that dumb I don't know though that's something that really true sort of a military thing I was speaking of before that's certainly true I mean his military may just go out and say Well we just Gorbachev said you can't do it and we're to not let you do it you know So Yeah that's real scary actually I mean I would expect their own problems would keep them away from us for a while but it could be real dangerous Yeah right we don't need to worry about them Yeah but wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else Yeah Well I don't know I think that underlying we're all probably not as different as everybody thinks Right Well that's certainly true of it That's true I was discussing with someone before this someone before actually one of these calls matter of fact about another topic but it came up one of these calls matter of fact about another topic but it came up this poem Everything I Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten or something You've read that one before this is the idea that    I think is actually very  + is  + is what I think  we should all revert to The idea that basically they said everything happened in kindergarten and in kindergarten we learned to share and we learned to play with each other we learned to take nap + and to take naps and whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other you know and that would be all If we could just do the same thing sort of with everybody else I suspect we'd be fine Yeah unfortunately Because I often sort of wonder how having never been to the Soviet Union how different the people there really are you know How much Yeah Right I would love to go there I mean like again not now but at some point to go see what this is like I mean this is amazing because this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us Like you said before so it would be interesting to watch Yeah that's and the ones I even feel somewhat worse for even the ones in like the Baltic states where they don't have a strong leader then you know at least Russia has some sort of strong leader I mean they have Yeltsin who may yet sort of help Russia But I mean the Baltic states I think are just sort of trapped I mean they were taken over you know not too long ago and then just sort of told well you're here now you're part of our country You be this way I think it's a sad state of affairs but yeah yeah Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah well yeah and that actually it sounds I mean very similar they were sort of forced and now they just want to sort of speak up and say Hey we want our piece And they have like a problem they have Muslims to deal with as well as Saddam Hussein I mean I think their big problem up there is you know unfortunately not only are they vic- there's more than one group fighting for the same place They all want the you know whereas the Baltics are saying we want our own We just want this little tiny piece of land Uh-huh Yes yes Uh-huh actually my wife is Syrian so also I know some of the history And actually the other funny thing is that I'm Jewish We're sort of like the Middle East peace talks ourselves So I know I've been to Israel and I know and I sort of toured the area and I know that it really is lots of different cultures in one place I mean and it's almost the same thing out in the Soviet Union right now you know there are you can't take a whole bunch of people who just aren't the same people and don't want to be together and put them together forcibly I mean we did it couple of hundred years ago here but they wanted to do it So that's certainly true Right I wonder if now the people in the Soviet Union don't have ideas very different from that
