Phil I guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work or do you like to do it Yeah Yeah so do you have a garden or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn Well that's pretty good my sister is very over zealous too She's got some really nice flower beds She puts a lot of time into them This is my first year in a house where I'm thinking about doing some flower beds and stuff I've always had crude ones at my father's but this is the first time that I really have to landscape a house His house is more like a farm house It's not on a main road My house is on a main road and it has nothing I mean nothing But what I do do and I've always done it is at my father's house my sister and I have a couple of gardens I think we figured out total this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre So we each have a third of an acre we do That's a lot Yeah well it's my dad's and he's been there for a long time so it just happens they built a shopping center next to it but they put up a nice fence so we still have a lot of privacy and we grow a lot of food I enjoy it the gardens are kind of old you have to step down in them now because we've tilled them so much but there's still we my sister uses probably a fertilizer I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing But I wish this phone would stop screeching Yes I'm trying I don't know if it's my phone This is bad It's not getting any better okay I don't think my phone really does that but every time I have this phone is a little weird I mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times Yeah I was beating on the phone going Can you hear me Yeah Yeah we grow a lot of the basic corn potatoes She likes to really get into her pumpkins and see how many she can grow Bas- corn potatoes and acorn squash are good winter keepers I mean things the way we grow are carrots cabbage that sort of goes to waste you know we just too much she starts her own plants She plants a lot of tomatoes I let her do all the planting and putting and I do a lot of the back work and stuff But she helps me a lot too She puts a lot of financial She plans it all out Beans like to be near certain types of plants Now they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like peas I don't know Something No it's just something like an onion and a tomato would go together but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans I guess it's just what scents it gives off they just don't like each other I mean she reads all kinds of books so I wish I knew more to tell you why but Yeah that's really weird I've put my cucumbers down at one end of the garden and like I'll make an L shape I've put my cantaloupe So they've been pretty close together But I don't think the vines they don't have to be touching or anything like you say they cross pollinate just by bees  Something weird this last season it was too wet up here we lost a lot of our root things our squash and our potatoes and we got half our yield It was really bad because of the water Yeah Yeah I have to do that I want to make some flower beds and I'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil And I'm going to my problem is I want to use those rail ties to build up a planter but I don't know if the creosote in the rail ties is going to do something you know if I want to grow a tomato or something in there I mean I guess it'd go with my flowers Yeah I just don't think you I always thought I'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird but I don't think I could really eat the fruit off it without wondering And I don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated Yeah but they put some kind of chemicals in there too Yeah Well I'm not really worried about it it's mainly for flower bed so I'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there But I yeah I do want to have a raised bed I've never my flower gardens are always been like on the ground it just looks so much better when it's up against the house tiered up Yeah this house that I have is just a three bedroom ranch and I can tell you there's nothing around it cement foundation all the way around it Not a shrub not a bush There was a lilac tree and the landlord cut it down and said Yeah that's one thing you have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding And I'm looking at him like Jeez People would kill to have a lilac bush and he's cutting it down So That's all right Flower beds are all right Anything as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding Yeah that's what he's worried about The trees or a bush because lilac bushes they grow fast Some people would really like to have them and then the people that do have them they spread and they sprout all over their lawn So they're kind of a pain but you know people who don't have them think they're great And people who do have them curse Another thing I have that is weird is a locus tree in the back yard As a matter of fact there's three of them very badly trimmed they aren't trimmed at all And I can imagine if I had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we'd do if the trees hang down and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it They're a pretty tree but when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns So we're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead Yeah because I can just see brushing up against it that it would rip your skin It's worse than a rose bush Many times worse because of course it's a tree Yeah my dad used to work on them so I don't think I'll have a problem My husband will have problems borrowing one Well if that's not the problem
