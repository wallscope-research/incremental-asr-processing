Actually I've been involved in electronics a long time in computers and I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home up until I guess maybe about a year and a half ago I got one for my son a Macintosh L C It's a real easy to use color computer and I got a very nice printer that goes along with it and he uses it for his school work Huh Where you going to school I see In engineering So that explains all the computer assignments Well do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work No No I just have one for my son and I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing at work I'm a technologist and I in the past have done a great deal of system development just through software development programming but now I find myself using the computer even the computer at work is primarily a word processing system and a communication system Yes Emil probably pulls down a third of all my time Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I'm a old-timer I did my Master's thesis on a typewriter I rented an I B M Selectric And it was a pretty big deal Yeah it was just a completely different world then I like it yeah I like it from a distance really I see the packages on it that are available and it's nice I really don't use it myself when I come home from work I like to stay far away from computers and electronic things so I let my son do it and of course you know there's an intellectual evolution taking place where it's sort of a joke but it's really true the old-timers even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like V C Rs and whatnot and the kids they just take to it like candy
