yes very appropriate I guess you ready for this Okay John just a moment Well guess what we get to talk about the weather Uh-huh you do so you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather I imagine it's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather Well actually I've heard on the news that we will be setting a record here in the State of Texas for the large amounts of rain and moisture we've had this year that it's going to break all kind of records that were set back since nineteen thirty-two So yeah If it keeps on raining like this and I understand it's supposed to rain until Saturday night yes Uh-huh Wow And so are you an airline pilot great For Southwest fantastic I have a brother that's a pilot also with American Yeah So I imagine with all this kind of weather it makes it kind of dangerous for you I guess so yeah Uh-huh yes Well we moved actually down here from another location and it's spectacular the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain Pardon me I've never seen a thunder show like I've seen down here before in Texas Lights up the whole sky and even on a actually I've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky it's a cloudless night and the rain isn't falling but you can excuse me see the lightening going horizontally across the sky and back and forth and what a light show it's fabulous Yeah that's true I'm from northern Utah and that's a very arid climate from Salt Lake City area and there's always a lot of snow In fact where I grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to twelve different major ski resorts and so there was an awful lot of snow and because it was an arid climate the snow was always a crisp powder light snow which made it fantastic for skiing and sleigh riding and everything else So we had a great time yeah in Snowbird and Solitude and Brighton and yes all those areas So I imagine have you skied before Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah Yeah great Well do you think the weather is typical for this time of the year Yes Yeah Yeah it's been cold There was a time though in the middle part of November that got really cool really really unseasonably cool and then it warmed right back up and I thought great and that's a fun th- yeah my wife was just listening here and she said yeah it froze in fact but I've really enjoyed the weather down here too because two years ago we were the day after Christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weather and it's not as severe I should say as the weather that I've experienced up in northern Utah Down here Not in Minnesota I have a brother-in-law that lives in Minnesota and they say boy six months out of the year it's bitter cold and the wind and the blowing snow and everything Uh-huh
