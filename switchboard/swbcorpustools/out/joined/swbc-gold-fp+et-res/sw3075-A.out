Certainly  Well I tend to take two kinds of vacations the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that well I couldn't live without the family vacations but my favorite is the indulgent ones where we go off and see places that have interested me since I was a kid for the most part And not anymore they've been in San Diego for the last few years and they're moving to Florida And that's one of those things you just have to go once a year So basically it sorts out into that and then about once every three or four years I try to get over to England because I lived there for a while some years back Oh Beautiful country Beautiful country beautiful people But and I'd really like to go because I'm fairly recently married and my husband has been hearing about these people for years but he's never met them so I'd like to do that But anyway that's our typical vacation and we enjoy the family vacations but the other ones are very special getaways and we probably take one of each every year How about yourself I've never been on a cruise Uh-huh Yeah  Well what do you do on a cruise I've never been on a cruise  Uh-huh Uh-huh And where have you been on these cruises I see the Mexican coast That's all Mexico I think Where are you from originally Uh-huh Uh-huh yes Well I grew up in Dallas so I mean it's not like I'm going home my parents retired first to San Diego and they're going now to Florida and so they're going very nice places thank God that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know I really came to love San Diego and feel very comfortable there They've been there eight years And you know I just grab the car and drive everywhere So it is nice but it's not home This is home and I've never thought about a cruise It's so funny Uh-huh Uh-huh What's the best part from your point of view Uh-huh that will be nice sure Sure Well don't go in the winter Oh Well there are exceptions made for special occasions like that But the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer so Well that sounds wonderful I guess I would contemplate going on a cruise all circumstances permitting it Uh-huh How long are the cruises Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I tend when I spend enough money to go overseas I go for a long time that's interesting Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh  That's really nice Uh-huh Well maybe now things are calming down again That will happen Well that's really great I mean as I said basically all I've done is go back and forth to parents and and my husband had a conference in L A so we spent a week in L A and of course I'm very unusual I like
