There you go Well Jean the subject is jury trials and should the jury recommend sentencing Now my personal opinion I don't know here lately it seems well up until a few years ago I guess there just too many liberals about and permitting too many they just broaden the human rights to cover just about everybody and I don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole It's just not right And therefore I think juries should be able to recommend sentencing Yes very possibly So many of us have led sheltered lives that when we sit in on a jury I've never done it myself unfortunately I wish I could have I've just never been called up Well now that's possible But I was called up as an alternate once but I never made it to the jury Not that I know of Uh-huh <> I've never heard of it well there again I suppose it should be Exactly Is it guilt or innocence But then again so many times you get one or two holdouts and it permits the criminal to get a retrial And there that's not too bad in this sense because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances I mean that's happened and giving them another trial might give them additional time to prove their innocence Yes We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials Uh-huh Uh-huh that's it and you just might resemble somebody out here in Texas we had a great miscarriage of justice after nine years it was finally taken care of We had a Black man was accused simply because he resembled someone who held up a Seven Eleven I think it was And even though he had witnesses that said that he was at work and he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not They found him guilty Well they said this happened during lunch time And he could have gotten away at lunch time and committed the robbery But after nine years well as a matter of fact they made a T V show about it after nine years they finally came up with evidence to prove that he was innocent Exactly Now that just was not fair So Yes Unfortunately that's what happens Well it's not the best system but it's the best one in the world Uh-huh And unfortunately we just have to put up with a lot of things and they try to solve them and everything but I don't know the Supreme Court well I'm still rancled about their decision to permit burning of the flag Well it the First Amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action And well that just rancles me no I swear if I ever saw somebody burning a flag I'd try to kill them I would Well I happen to be a flag freak I was in the service I was in Korea and well I saw what the red in the flag represents Uh-huh Yeah see what they See how they'd like it under another flag Uh-huh Well Jean we seem to be of the same opinions here I hope they get something out of this passing sentence Well yes but I think the jury should be able to recommend Yes yes yes I don't know if that's a regular procedure or what But I know I'm always hearing that well the jury came in with a guilty verdict and they recommended twenty years or something Yes Of course now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence They may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five Uh-huh Yeah but too many times they are permitted to go out on parole and Yes They just go out and repeat their crimes Well there well they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison but I think they ought to make it two offenses Uh-huh Yeah very true Well here again now there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently Race or nationality even <> But like you said it's not the best system but it's the best one we've got Uh-huh Sure enough Jean it's been awful nice talking to you Well let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing Take care now Bye
