Okay as far as universal health care I guess I'm all for it I think it's time that we start looking at getting into that health cost has continued to rise and I think there's people that to me it's the fundamental life of a person it doesn't matter if you have money or all the money in the world you would Everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits I think if they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and individuals helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how But the expenses right now for health care are just unreal Yes Uh-huh sure And your constantly Exactly Yeah The only I know a little bit about the European universal health care and there's some pros and cons One of the things of course is everybody gets health care but sometimes health care when you get into a universal system lacks in what would be considered how can I say it over like in Poland where my father-in-law lived for years there their health care system is because no financial gains are available for doctors they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason but most people that go in to being a physician here in the U S do it for financial gain They say well jeez If I get into this area of dermatology I don't have to do this I can do this and I can you know Yeah or plastic surgery or if I become a heart specialist I'm going to make this kind of money and there's you know financial gains toward that And in a universal system I don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors The quality I think goes down Uh-huh when you have a universal system the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check and also offering some kind of because I think well anybody likes the ability to kind of get themselves financially situated I guess that's the whole U S concept is to come here and Yeah and I don't know if you can have that with a universal system Maybe you know there's a way of working that out but I know that in Poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it That's what they look at it as There's no and that's sad because if that's the case if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway But that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind So But I think we have to head toward that way Uh-huh I'm worried when I get older You know and let's say for instance you get maybe laid off from your job You no longer have insurance I mean and you're sixty some or fifty some years old you try to find insurance I mean you're uninsurable Unless you want to pay five hundred six hundred dollars a month and I know people that are paying two hundred three hundred dollars a month for insurance And how they can do it I have no idea I know working for small corporations and health insurance myself it would cost for a family and this was back three four years ago to put my entire family up and this was working for like a med center health plan it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck So See Yeah Well we do the same I mean it's I think people are changing their viewpoints of you know it's getting harder and harder to survive and that's why if they don't go to a universal system something is going to happen We're going to have a larger amount of people dying
