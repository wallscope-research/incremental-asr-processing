what how do you get your main source of current events I either watch the news or occasionally I'll read the paper no I think the media's a little bit too manipulative They allow you they try to lead you too much I believe and sometimes they're not very open I don't know I think they're a little bit biased sometimes Like for example the Kennedy rape case The coverage on that was you know when it first happened it was he was guilty he was guilty he was guilty You know they try to have you form opinions or whatever and then I didn't like the things that were going on when we had Desert Storm and stuff like that You know basically I think they don't present the whole sides of everything Right it's more like an editorial I believe on a lot of issues Yeah Well when I was in school I was a communications major so I'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking and so forth I was and I ventured off in a whole entire different field I went with the state And I went with the Department of State Treasurer in retirement disability calculate benefits Yeah So the and you know you know working for state government you hear all about current events about things going on within the state itself So that's another source where I keep up with current events and It's a lot of money It's a lot of money No well no I primarily deal with the state employees but I find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as like the state of North Carolina's budget and stuff like that And I really know what the budget is and when they were saying we were so poor and they couldn't pay taxes and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that and you know I'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has and it's just funny You know so that's so I don't have a whole lot of faith in you know the news Course it's they get what they hear from but you know it's not always I think one hundred percent reliable I think they need to go into a little bit more depth before they would just report like somebody wants to make a statement or something like that because I mean another example is the AIDS issue or whatever You know someone said I found a cure They immediately the headlines on the news or whatever is Someone says they found a cure for AIDS And then two months later it's discovered it's not you know before they come out with something like that they need to research the matter I believe a little bit more Well that well yeah I it I think the
