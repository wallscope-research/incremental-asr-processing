Okay what do you do this weekend Which is what do you have planned for your yard Uh-huh  What part of the state do you live in okay Okay My wife and I we live in Dallas too so Yeah just what that area we're planning on moving to Flower Mound and we're going to be getting some wheel h- we're going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there Seems like it the place we've been living at we're just leasing it in Plano the soil has such a high clay content that I went to use my dad-in-law's tiller and it about for my arms off sockets I mean just scratching two or three inches was just a chore it was and then when it gets wet you know you don't even want to get out in the yard it's horrible It's a nightmare But I don't know where you live is there a real high alkaline or ash content or Yeah yeah I know right where that's at Uh-huh Really Golly is it limestone underneath How do you put trees in there  Oh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah yeah we tried planting tomatoes last year and they turned out pretty poor I just wish I'd known the variety and everything But it's amazing we also have roses and I mean they just grow so beautifully Like what type roses hybrid teas Yeah we have a few of the real short stem they're kind of like the bush roses But I don't know I think it only has about five or six more years to go because it's a really old bush but I'm amazed because the sun is so intense and the roses just seem to survive just fine there Uh-huh  Yeah have you done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not Yeah Yeah just if you want a lot of you know light for underneath that may be all right because we have some old fruit trees We have a plum that's just about ready to go so we may just be getting rid of that but our peaches they seem to be doing just fine but they really need pruning It just seems like that even you know pruning once a year is really not enough but the way they behave I don't know but what kind of grass are you growing Bermuda Yeah I've been trying a mixture of the bermuda and the rye but I may be working like a fescue in because of you know the type of weather It seems that bermuda's fine but it looks like it would hold the soil but it really doesn't A lot of silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well but the rye does really well Especially during the wintertime but boy once it gets over seventy seventy-five degrees it just dries up shrivels up and dies But anyway Yeah my parents-in-law they're building a house into the side of a hill well it's already been built and everything They've been living there for about three months now but this is out in west Texas but the wind there has been so bad that I mean they've tried to plant grass and they just have some big time problems so they just washing watching their lawn just blow away But it's quite an undertaking They have about two or three acres of land on lake front property on the side of a hill It's beautiful I mean you can see the house from you know miles away but you know it's a pretty neat little job but they save a lot of energy but just you know for them I mean they're going to have to start gardening It's going to be from the ground up The whole way And they said well we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just getting this property developed It's amazing I mean all they have are mesquite and cottonwoods and it's all on Lake Greenbelt that property out there And I don't know what they have they have all the water they want actually they can pump water I mean they have to get permission but they can pump water up from the shore but that's for like an additional they have to pay like some kind of fee per year But right now though I think they're trying to get the trees planted and everything But man I just think of all of the money that they're going to have to spend just getting that But the taxes alone there Lake Greenbelt and some places they really nail them for tax And I mean your talking what just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes it's ridiculous Yeah No no it's not it's because even though it's far out there it's just that Lake Greenbelt you know they try to do it just from selling the water But the water usage you know they try to limit even though there's three or four streams that flow into it people still use it enough like in towns like Clarendon and other areas where they irrigate they still haven't gotten used to the dry land farming but the irrigation because it's gotten so bad the past few years but I don't know I just came back from there and just the air is so dry I don't see how anything can survive out there for long periods of time Should say my father-in-law says the mesquite trees are they're pretty smart they're smart they're about the smartest tree around they don't even start growing until May or April like after it's been raining for a few months They say the roots have developed so that's all they work on Just a leafy they don't do anything Uh-huh I don't know my wife and I on the south side of our house we planted some gardenias And they did real fine during the summertime it's just but during the fall when it stopped when the rain let off just a little bit I mean it just dried up so I guess these plants they don't it's like they remain
