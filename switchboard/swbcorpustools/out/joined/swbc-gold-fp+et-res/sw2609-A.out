Well do you think I mean I wonder the assumption is that it is a problem and I've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem though I have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem but it's not clear to me that it is it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions But if those who don't vote if you made them vote and it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way you know in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote it's not clear to me that it is really a problem I mean I assume that those who don't vote I mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote they tend to be you know poor blacks for example vote very little and things like that and I assume that they would vote differently if they were voting than your average voter But I don't know if that's the case In fact I've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't I guess not I vote religiously I really do I guess I'm a fan of democracy and wish I could vote on more things frankly But it's funny because here in California things are getting increasingly democratically oriented in the sense of people being able to vote for things I mean we have these state initiatives now The first really you know wide spread one was Proposition Thirteen which was a tax revolt against property taxes and you know now we're and that was whatever ten years ago and now we're up to Proposition a Hundred and fifty or something like that I mean we've just there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were being asked to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals and you had to vote for you know yes or no on each of them and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them and it was incredibly complicated and difficult And a lot of people revolted against that they said we don't want to have to decide all these things you know that's why we hire people you know to make these decisions for us Yeah I do t- Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah I wouldn't mind having more votes than I get to have frankly Anyone who doesn't vote it's fine with me as long as I can have their vote That would make me happy though Maybe not in a deep philosophical sense but in a selfish sense it probably would I don't know it's interesting some countries voting is obligatory it is in Australia for example Yeah yeah I don't know how I feel about that Well Australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the United States And it's not for me to say that they're not they feel I mean here you have the right to vote and they simply define it as a duty there You know just as we have a duty to pay taxes you know is that democratic I mean we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country we have the duty to pay taxes And in that country it's a duty to pay taxes and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent And it's not clear to me that that's so much less democratic I don't know but part of me rebels against that but then I'm an American Yeah And some people don't vote I mean there is like three or four percent of Australians don't vote and I think they're eligible for a fine I don't know if they actually are fined or what happens but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote Uh-huh Yeah I was sort of s- Well I that's how I feel I mean if you vote and your guy looses well you least tried and you can say something but if you don't vote part of me and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like well if you didn't vote you get what's coming to you you know And certainly that's true in the overall I mean no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole I sort of feel that way especially when they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for or something like that listen: two utts And you know I say well you know voting for the lesser of two evils is still important Yeah yeah I mean it's funny because technically you do I mean you have the right to do a write in candidate But of course that's not really a vote  Yes it really doesn't and so it's a complicated situation but I would like to see I don't know I'm thinking of actually moving to Australia and perhaps I'll call you back and let you know how the Australian system works I mean  not because of the vo- + I mean I'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting but just because of a job opportunity And I No I'm not so I'm really quite curious how that would work to have both I mean you know and I believe in a certain Soviet bloc countries you are obliged to vote too In fact it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for up until fairly recently and that's what I think of when I think of you're obliged to vote But when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country with its two party system I don't know I kind of part of me is wary and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Well that's a thought or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have I don't know The right to write your Yeah see that's an example of a right not a actually that's considered a privilege not a right Yeah but technically most people technically it's a privilege but most people think of it as a right I mean in other words if the government denies you a drivers license people get very upset But actually it's a privilege which is allowed to be revoked And fortunately voting isn't that well except if you're a felon if you're a felon it is taken away from you I mean they will take away your right to vote under certain circumstances so gosh so we don't have a great solution yet do we But I don't know if you've read any of the early republic documents when they were arguing through constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people I think it was Hamilton who wrote number ten or something where he was arguing for a republican not in the sense of the Republican party now versus a democratic government and arguing successfully why the United States should be a republic not a democracy Which indeed it really is a republic not a democracy Where he defines democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues In other words you vote for representatives And the whole idea was presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy Because just as you can have a tyranny of a single you know bad ruler or something you can have a tyranny of the majority And he makes a very passionate good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process because anytime you have a majority they can change the law in a fully democratic process and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case you know a candi- if there's some minority that people don't like because of you know racial hatred or something like that the majority can just simply vote against them And cases like that he argues need to be constrained and actually I agree except that I don't trust the people who are appointed to vote Yeah well I mean I feel that wa- Yeah well their job is to be reelected by in large and so they work on that job And there's also an antigovernment mood in the country you know where government is misspending your dollars and they're all fools and you know throw the bastards out that kind of thing And there's a notion that somehow if someone isn't as much as a government person they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange because I mean if I'm hiring a plumber I want a real plumber I want someone trained in
