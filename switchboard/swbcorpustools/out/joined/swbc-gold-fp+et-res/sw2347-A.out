I've uh as far as I'm concerned I find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating and I think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now I would like uh yes I have worked outside of the home and I was in one of those safe occupations I was a school teacher and we had one child when I taught for my two year career Uh we uh then I stopped teaching after my husband's bus- business was established and we had two children and I stayed home with those children and raised those children and now that my husband has retired I am back substitute teaching which if anyone has ever been involved in that some days it's fun and some days you wonder why you're even bothering because your fighting for your life But I am a fighter and I've always been a disciplinarian Uh I'm I'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply I think they're going in by choice Yes And and I have no problem with that but I think the male needs to be the dominant person And I think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand uh are not letting that happen They are very aggressive They're uh they almost have what I would call a killer e- killer bee instinct And they have to be in charge And and I th- I think they lose a lot by what I call neutering their husbands Uh-huh Oh sure Uh-huh Huh Uh-huh If my wife had an education and could support us and the only value I see coming out of this is that children now in in a two parent home they now actually have two parents because I see my sons-in-law I have a daughter who's a nurse and I have a daughter who's a beautician And I see my sons-in-law cooking and dropping children off at the sitter and picking children up from school and and having a much better relationship with their children than my husband ever did because he left home at five thirty in the morning and he got home at six fifteen And uh he ate his dinner and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted So now the young fathers are having a chance to parent and I think that's an advantage Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh And I think it's a a wonderful advantage for the young for the for the particularly for the males for the little boys to have a relationship with their father and and I don't think you we get into so much of the mother dominating figure if if the father has more input there But uh I don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads and they have to that kind of job uh to go out there and shovel that tar and and drive those big trucks And we just recently finished a long drive through the west a little over five thousand miles and at one point we sat down uh I didn't realize it but I sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only And here's this young girl with the tattoos and she w- has just had just driven a load of meat from Minneapolis to some place in Arizona and she'd been and I ask her how old she was and she was the ag- between the age of our daughters and she had been driving a truck for seven years And I thought gosh I mean why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life-style when I guess I'm s- I'm a- maybe Victorian and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist in that he's a very considerate person but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and and in the home and she should vote but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote Now it probably doesn't work that way in our household because I have strong opinions about things too but uh I like being taken care of I like my luggage carried and my door opened and I think the young women are losing that and I think that's sad He was raised in the south I think that's a little war condition both Uh-huh Huh Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh Huh Uh-huh Huh I think a lot of my problem with the young mothers i-
