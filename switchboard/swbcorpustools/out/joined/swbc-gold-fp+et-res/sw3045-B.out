I don't have one in my home here My parents have one and they live just about three miles away so we use that one And my in-laws also have one and they're almost as close They're in Richardson usually word processing something such as forms for things also I have a nine year old that I've been home schooling for the last three years And we got the one that my parents have is an Apple Two E And I have a sister-in-law who works in the Fort Worth school district And so she got me copies of several of the Apple for school programs and so we use those and there's some whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game so that's part of it my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things his resume his letter he's been applying for jobs and things that type of thing forms for his photography business and that kind of thing Yeah I'm my father had a software company and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing here But they're kind of older so I'm not sure that we'll be able to get too many other programs for it  I have one of those Yeah Mines broke at the moment but  Yeah I learned Wordstar I did some typing for my father when he had the company and so I learned that on there too that was I haven't That's the one that my father well I guess I have used it once or twice it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer He's got on I B M so that's the program that they're using there That's what I've heard Uh-huh Yeah you had to memorize it and  that's neat how wonderful I had heard that That was a better one Yeah Yeah I agree Not too much what kind of things do you write  <> Go talk to Daddy about it Excuse me <> Go on and talk to Daddy about it Tell Daddy I unplugged it for you But you don't need to drag it down the hall Daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that I had unplugged Yeah  Yeah Yeah I'm anxious some day to have one here I'm and they just talked the other day about setting something up again so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing My nine year old I've decided to teach her how to type using the computer so Yeah I've That's right Uh-huh Yeah we've been writing a story together and I wanted her to put it into the computer and then print it out and make a book with it you know And so I decided well if she's going to do that it would be a whole lot easier if she could type So we'll slowly learn just to type here and then put the story in Yes yes I agree Yeah
