Yeah this is a great topic for me because I just did my first two painting projects ever Was not a big deal two little deals The first one I helped someone repaint an apartment and it was very easy Yeah and I've never painted anyth- I always thought it would be so you know you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something but I know I can do it And the second one was I bought some toys at a craft fair They're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for Christmas and so I decided to paint them and that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment Well that's half the problem right there is that it was a oil base so I had to get and when I painted them I didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house So I had it all over my hands At first I didn't realize you know I had never painted anything so I didn't realize that I needed that I mean I kind of knew in the back of my mind Well no you can use it on wood but I just had it all over my hands and I went to wash the brushes out and wash my hands and you can't wash it off with water You have to get a solution and Yeah I had to drive to the store yeah I had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and everything like that and then downstairs in the apartment we just used a latex base and so you can drip it on you know if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean Yeah and it just like the same with the toys it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it you know it says Safe for Children and all that Yeah Have you painted anything recently Wow was it huge Uh-huh Yeah Wow Yeah I think though we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work because I don't know if I could you know I don't know I don't know must be difficult No it was really easy I just like what we had a couple of different size brushes you know real easy I went around the trim and if it and there was wall paper like I was just doing just the trim around the doors and windows and there was wall paper and if we got it on the wall paper a little bit we just wipe it right away before it dried it came right off so there was no major mistakes there was two actually and it there was you know around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that but that Well yeah if you just you know we didn't tape anything we weren't that careful but it wasn't you know I don't know it's funny it's like if you just go slow or at least I didn't get that many mistakes I didn't make that many mistakes Why Just because you'd be afraid to do it or have you done it before Well it wasn't if it was my own I would have but my friend said just go ahead you just go ahead it's easy I said Okay it's your place Well a couple of week ends we would go down two or three hours on the weekends and No they were doing all sorts of repairs and I was just painting because I don't know how to do anything else So there's a whole bunch of people So now I feel like if I ever buy a house I can probably paint if nothing else Yeah But you know I went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys and the guy said get this it's a nice shiny gloss which was true but I didn't realize what you know pain it is to clean the brushes and everything if you don't have latex I don't if it's worth the shine
