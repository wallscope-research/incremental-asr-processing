Okay what kind of house do you live in Uh-huh Well it sounds like ours are pretty similar I live in one I don't have a swimming pool And mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot But the four bedrooms and all the rest of it sounds just about alike I think it's pretty much typical for this area I've been in the house I'm in here right now about twelve and a half years Uh-huh really Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I bet you Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that sounds interesting I bet he's enjoyed having it that way because some- kind of hard to find one prebuilt that kind of fits those specifications Uh-huh Well then most of them don't have a three car garage They're kind of rare Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that we've just got a two car garage but my husband's got a big space in between where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop you know workbench and everything Now mine does not work on cars he just piddles on this and that But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his piddling things It really is Because you know they have a lot of things of their own and you know I wouldn't mind having and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff but someone I don't know it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something So I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I still all three of my daughters are married but I don't know I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time And some of them coming back home and things you know And we've got grandchildren now so when they come they have to have a place That's right you sure don't At times I keep thinking though that might be kind of nice Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I don't blame you for that Well I have the three girls and then we ended up with four grandsons And little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls And I enjoy them coming but for short doses It feels after they've been here ten minutes they have already explored the entire house they know everything But they're fun Well I just watch them I never did put things up when my kids were little and I haven't with them I try to teach them not to get into things I think that once you do that your children kind of develop the same attitudes At least my daughters have They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up So it's worked pretty well There's I don't really think anything's been broken Every now and then we have to kind of go and say now don't bother this you know But all in all they mind pretty well But I guess most of the hou- d- what kind of roof does your house have Here I'm getting off the subject
