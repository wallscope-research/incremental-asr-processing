Well actually I don't think they're out of line Devil's advocate possibly but you are trying to avoid paying taxes and whether or not you agree with that law you're still circumventing it You are legal in your circumvention of that law Really I don't think that's a valid argument I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax naturally some things you just can't find in your local K-Mart or Bryn Mawr stereo dealer but then why not pay the sales tax Corporations have to why should an individual just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax Yes I'll agree it's not your responsibility b- is it also legal for you to do that from what I understand from various net readings the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes into place in the next few years it is a lost revenue stream right now and states can use all the revenue they can get with something like that do your arguments still apply Which is exactly what businesses do at the present And I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having to pay sales tax on it That's my understanding of the way it works Usually the person ordering doesn't pay But the accounting department will suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay And there are some substantial nasty penalties if businesses try to avoid that I- No Businesses if purchasing things mail order if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see this great deal on forty-six mother boards from say Utah I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax My accounting department will at the end of the month I think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania And I know they work that way say here in D C Yeah That's true a big hole does exist right now in that consumers can just say I forgot that there is no well defined mechanism at all and that it is a loss I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism just in order to gain the revenue that's being lost I mean I don't know if I agree with that but
