Type of music is hot down in Texas okay mostly folk music Yeah I find myself listening to a lot of either old timer or New England dance bands as well as just more popular folk music and new artists coming up Okay Uh-huh Yeah what about classic rock type stations okay So some of the older Eagles stuff was good I didn't like they started getting a little more you know the type of music at least to me only sounds good at a high volumes and I don't like listening at high volumes But some of their older stuff was you know quite enjoyable to me You know Hotel California and that era Yeah Well down in Texas you know listen to a little country every now and then I'm sure there's a lot of that down there Well there's a Conway Twitty twang then there's the Dolly Parton Hollywood sound Yeah Yeah I think some of them the artists are even hitting the pop charts Hey I think most artists are in to make a few bucks But they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do- late sixties early seventies they were definitely pushing a message Yeah I don't think Gun at least to my mind Guns and Roses doesn't have too much to say Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Yeah it's the artist not the merit Yeah Well I don't know I know for myself that for the most part I don't know which artist is which so I listen to a song I either like the song or I don't like it and then if I really like the song eventually I'll figure out who it was Well you have to figure out what to buy or do you just buy along the same artist Yeah Yeah so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album then you stop Yeah Yeah see that's one thing I like about some of the folk music scenes you know there's a couple of nice small coffee houses up in New Jersey And it's very nice you go into the coffee house and you know an artist is there and very often the artist will have an album and so if you like the artist you buy the album So you definitely get to try before you buy You know it you don't always quite get it right
