Well what are your do you use credit cards Huh-uh So it doesn't get uh uh the credit uh the interest rate is so high that you're really if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy I think don't you Otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that uh it's not a very good idea Well I have a lot of them but I don't use them very much though I use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes uh tuition you know if I'm short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as I can The other thing I think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off uh more than one at a time because I think you could run forever paying what they require Just goes on and on Yeah Yeah that's true There are times when it's very useful like uh emergency trip or something Sometimes when you the money will be available but it's you know not immediately handy I think uh they're very helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes But uh you really do need to be very um oh responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble Uh-huh Right Right That can be very handy under those kind of circumstances The other thing about them is too you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and haven't developed a credit thing It stops you from doing a lot of things if you pay for everything by cash uh there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or a car so they have become a very vital part of our monetary system over the last few years But uh it's true you have to be very careful or you end up uh going in the deep end uh and an awful lot of people are in trouble We have a boy living with us who works for a credit card uh company that and he makes calls to people who have problems you know credit problems that are trying to work out and uh Poor thing he comes home very depressed every night because the world has so many problems of that sort so uh it's a really big problem I think and um takes mature people to treat it uh so that it's a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage Yeah Right It didn't do you any good now does it Even before it probably wasn't though because you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying So well I'm not other than that I don't have too much on credit cards but It's good to talk to you Uh-huh bye now
