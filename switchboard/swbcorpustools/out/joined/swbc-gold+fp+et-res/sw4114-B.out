Uh it's pretty good you know You get uh closer to the uh coast here and you do get a good bit of uh smog and stuff especially from all the uh fuel cracking towers and chemical plants Yeah it's when you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial but I'm about uh thirty miles west of there so you have uh actually green trees and such that you don't notice that other part of New Jersey exists Actually very you know you go even a few miles out and you got uh farms and everything so you relatively clear air But uh Oh definitely It's uh you know there are a large number of them on the road They're all you know going and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair Oh even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year You get the car that's in the accident and muffler falls off or something and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that Yeah that and I think also some of the uh car companies are coming out with uh gas powered fleets so you natural gas powered rather than uh gasoline it is coming from cars though I mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon Which is one of the major fluorocarbons Well it No it's the type of thing there that uh you know the Third World countries are less industrial and they want to become industrial so they're on the different part of the cycle of the U S The U S used you know all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to where we got to Yeah No Well you also have the very close related thing of the uh rain forest destruction which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants I've mostly been in the east coast so that's going between Atlanta D C area A- Well not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the inversion and Los Angeles and rest of California which is just terrible it sounds Uh-huh Yeah Yeah there it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of heavy industry you know that would be causing it Uh-huh
