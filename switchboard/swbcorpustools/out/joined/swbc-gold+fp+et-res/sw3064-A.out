Do you use credit cards a good bit Uh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Okay Absolutely Right Uh-huh Yeah Well actually I have a whole wallet full of credit cards I don't use them very often Um oh I try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week and try to use a different one so that you know I keep those active I have a half a dozen department store credit cards and I'll use those if I need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that just enough to keep them active My biggies are the VISA MasterCard and Discover And for the most part I had used those for like uh charging airline tickets where you know you could make the transaction over the telephone or I fly Southwest a good little bit which means I can just run that card through the machine Uh and it saves a lot time And that's what I was using it for However we had a very pressing financial family crisis which said you have no alternative you must have the money to do this with and you do not have any other options so I charged all three of those cards up and right now I am paying and praying But uh Uh-huh Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh <> Well  I never did + Right I never did  use it for an advance Most of my charges were uh medications Didn't have cash for the medications or uh the doctor would accept MasterCard or VISA And uh a lot of times you can get by using those for uh uh different labs will use those charge accounts for Uh-huh <> Well I have not like I said that was just one period in my life where that was critical I don't generally charge I say well I need a checkup in six months and I kind of set that aside and just pay for it I'm reimbursed on insurance anyway and I can handle you know paying for it and waiting two or three weeks Getting into a credit card fiasco is easy It is easy and it's very difficult to get out I just cringe every month when I see those interest charges I say wow I ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off Big deal I'm saving two percent Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Oh yeah and it's not just paying back what you've charged it's paying that and half again Uh you send in uh uh fifty dollars you're going to pay twenty twenty-five in interest charges You only get half of that paid for the principal so I'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts Now uh I mean as the monthly payment amount goes down that will free up more cash where I can continue to make the larger payments Uh as long as I don't have a major disaster where I have to use it again I can do that Meantime though I'm not building any reserves Anything that I could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh right right Uh-huh <> uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Well you either need a big chunk of money or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account you can make a single lump sum payment Now those are very handy if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments sharp good no problem because you're living on the other guy's money for a while But I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money And it just irks me I say my gosh I had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this and I've got three cards I've lost a whole day of my life to interest Yeah yeah And that just blows my mind my house is paid for my car is paid for I've got some home improvements but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards Uh-huh Uh-huh That's right I think that is a good healthy safe use of credit cards Uh-huh uh-huh Uh I went to a seminar they said don't ever use your credit card for consumable items You only use credit cards for investments I said for crying out loud you know if I could do some investing you'd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card That doesn't make a bit of sense to me I thought God dang where is his pencil That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh <> You also have to have that willingness to commit to that because you're committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it
