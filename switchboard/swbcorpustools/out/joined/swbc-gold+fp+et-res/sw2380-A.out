Do you Uh-huh Sure Well I do think that the cases uh oh say something like Texaco versus Pennzoil or the Texaco Pennzoil problem uh is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand and really should have some better way where people who understand both the circumstances and the complex issues involved should handle cases like that Oh is that right Yeah Okay boy uh or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury Uh I was only on one jury ever so far in my life and uh it really was a pretty trivial case and it seemed to me all the time I was thinking of all these people in the courtroom over the case that involved oh a couple thousand dollars I think it was really just uh uh terrific waste of everybody's time and money And it finally ended up that uh even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it they settled the case they had settled while we were deliberating Now the one thing I did approve of there was that we didn't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case And uh we were split uh ten to two so it was uh a good thing that it wasn't a total waste of time to have a hung jury on a case that trivial Well I think that the trial in a sense is kind of a threat to hold over people to try to get them to reach an agreement out of court because it does cost so much money Uh-huh Sure Yeah Yeah I was a witness in a criminal case And it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much evidence was excluded and that the jury was never allowed to hear and they convicted the defendant on as far as I could tell very flimsy evidence and two perjured testimonies And I knew the people involved the people who d and the people who uh were defendants And yeah I think that was just a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the uh you know staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury that uh were highly irrelevant to the case and could I thought have established the defendant's innocence So uh I do although I'm a lawyer's daughter and I have lawyer's and judges on both sides of the family and uncles and cousins and things like that I really think that we have gotten into much too legalistic of society and that we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and far too little on achieving justice Uh-huh Well and then in a lot of Yeah in criminal cases uh for instance you can't bring up prior convictions unless they are somehow directly related to the case And it seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime now it's possible that he didn't commit the but the likelihood certainly tilts it With a record like that And that was one of the things that was not allowed in the uh trial I went to though uh one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony had a long criminal record and had been you know a real sleaze bag And he came in and was presented to the court as a standing young man who had uh been in seminary to become a priest and you would have thought the guy was just pure as the driven snow but I happen to know his background and I know that he would have sold out his mother for uh uh shorter sentence And you know it's really annoying when the I asked the defense attorney later why he didn't bring up all this other trouble the guy had been in He said that was barred uh by the court So we do have some problems and it seems to me that uh maybe it's time to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles and start over And then make a legal system that carefully protects people but uh where you Yeah Yeah that would be wrongful Sure would Um Um And you think that would be relevant Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah right Uh-huh I think so and I Yeah that's something I thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen And it seems to me that you'd get a lot more uh information if your questions were heard if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things or the lawyers things or even the judge But particularly the witnesses Or if they would allow them to uh give broader answers they it's really kind of uh choreographed It's like a script has been written when people testify They aren't testifying really in their own words Yeah I can remember uh friends of Daddy
