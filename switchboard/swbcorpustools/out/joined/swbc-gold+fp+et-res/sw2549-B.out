I guess we're on Do you usually get a message Um Hang on let me check on it I don't know Okay Yeah Um well not really from you know I really wasn't from here so uh the teams I really root for in football are the Niners and the Seahawks um you know mostly because only the Niners because I used to live out in California you know like I like Seattle because I like Seattle and besides I like the city Uh yeah San Jose actually but close Yeah Oh okay Oh is that where you are now Oh okay Uh-huh Oh yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well you know you back the winners and you don't back them when they're not doing well Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah It makes sense because you know you've got the flexibility if they're good athlete they can you know do a bunch of different things Um And I don't you know my main sport is baseball but you know um I've been enjoying football but I don't know it as well Um I just you know um Cowboys are going to have a problem aren't they is it this year they don't have a draft pick because of the Walker trade or what was the whole deal on that They don't have anything high do they Oh that's right that's right They it went the other way What was I thinking they traded Herschel to Minnesota Yeah okay My brain is really working well tonight Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah I mean you know if you go to you know I'm sure if you go to any of the twenty-eight coaches in football in training camp they say oh we're going to be Super Bowl Champs because I know in baseball you know any manager you go to say well we're going to be in the World Series even though you know there's not a prayer Uh this is the way it is Well Kim I mean didn't the Cowboys even finish they finished pretty close to five hundred last year didn't they Because they only won one game the year before right Okay Yeah I enjoyed that because it was against the Skins Um no I live near Baltimore and um um I really don't like D C a whole lot at all And um I mean I'm really they got a big thing because of the expansion going on in baseball D C is like talking about how they're going to get a baseball team and everything It's like you guys aren't going to get a baseball team I'm sorry it's not going to happen But of course you know the griping is that if Washington doesn't get uh a baseball team then Baltimore shouldn't get a football team Which is probably true but anyway um I've never liked D C a whole lot and a really hate the Redskins And a lot of it's because you know I got a lot of people you know at work with and everything that are big Redskin fans Yeah I've never liked Philadelphia the city a whole lot The only reason I really enjoy the Eagles at all is because uh I really like Randall Cunningham Ye- well considering how well he gets along with uh Jimmy Johnson that doesn't surprise me Yeah um uh there was this uh ther- in the Baltimore Sun has this uh cartoonist in the sports section and uh when uh last I guess it was January when um Jimmy Johnson got named coach of the year or whatever It was the same year that Buddy Ryan got fired And uh he had this cartoon in there about Jimmy Johnson's big day you know the first thing is the phone call you know from the league saying he uh um you know uh was coach of the year and the second was this phone call from Buddy Ryan I got fired can you believe that Yeah No I lived do you know what Ellicott City is Uh it's just west of Baltimore off Route Seventy Yeah but basical- well Route Seventy and uh Route Forty Um Oh okay Yeah that's not far from where uh the new football stadium would be if we got an N F L team Yeah Well they've built a new stadium downtown um it's opening next year So The Inner Harbor Yeah It's um a couple of blocks west um there is an old railroad yard basically um there's a big long railroad shed and then there's uh an old station and they're building the stadium on the other side of the shed from the Inner Harbor which is really + stupid because one of the big selling points of the new stadium is supposed to be this view of the Inner Harbor and the only way you're going to have a view of is this big brick wall um but you know they're building the baseball stadium and they've got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get a N F L team So it's um real easy access from south of Baltimore um like the airport or more importantly for the Orioles from Washington D C The Orioles say they get twenty-five percent of I mean uh their attendance from D C Uh-huh Yeah They really ought to change the name I think in Indianapolis I uh never been real thrilled with well not you know sitting here and talking about all the cities that I hate uh I went to Purdue University for a couple of years and uh really learned to hate Indianapolis while I was out there And um I was not real happy uh when they uh left to go there of all places No uh I transferred to Delaware and graduated there Yeah Yeah but it's close to Philadelphia and Baltimore so it's Uh kind of all over the place but east coast lately
