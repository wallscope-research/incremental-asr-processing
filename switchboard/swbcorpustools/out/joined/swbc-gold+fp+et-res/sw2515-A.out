Hi Maureen How are you Well do you have a family budget Okay We do a few things and I have to say my husband and I are both from financial backgrounds I'm an accountant And uh he has an M B A so uh we were sort of you know keyed in on expenses and things like that So Um coming from that background what we pretty much do is in our household as far as living expenses we live on a cash budget Every month my husband uh goes to the credit union and withdraws you know X amount of dollars for the month and then that money is used during that month We have a certain budget Excuse me For instance I control all the household expenses the groceries uh the haircuts the gasoline for my car any miscellaneous expenses baby-sitting things like that And uh excuse me if uh it comes the end of the month and I don't have any money uh we don't buy any more milk But uh we've gotten pretty good at it we've been doing it a couple of years now So our budgets are realistic and they are not so stringent you know to make us feel uncomfortable And I really try to stretch my dollars here and there shopping uh at warehouses sometimes like at Sam's and things like that But uh we live on a cash budget and sometimes it's tight come the end of the month but generally we always make it Right Well uh most of our medical things we don't uh have to worry about because of insurance and they're relatively small Uh we've been lucky In the past we didn't have that problem but right now we don't For the other things the things that crop up that we aren't really expecting we have different funds set aside for different things Like we have a car fund and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not So I mean and I can't really remember what it is It's all part of the savings account We just keep track of it on paper Uh you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account We decide okay you know let's say it's a hundred dollars You know every month fifteen dollars is for car fund You know Ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever Uh and we constantly do that so that there's a buildup of money for those things if something does come up Like I know that my washing machine is going to go any day but we have the money set aside so if it does it's not going to kill us Uh so we're pretty disciplined so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through Well in Uh we have a lot of different things Right now we save about twenty-five percent of our pay and it goes toward different things it's you know for vacations like I said for you know emergencies like for car uh breaks down something like that Uh and we also put money aside for our kids college Neither of us had any help with our college degrees and just this last month we paid off my final school loan So We're starting our kids a little bit early Do you uh use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things Sure Uh-huh That's good Oh and it's not deductible anymore Yeah we did that for a long time and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things And it seemed like we didn't have enough money when things cropped up you know so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget Well the first time we did it we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be and then we kept track of everything for a month You know how much we spent on food how much we spent on gasoline how much we spent on everything and from that built you know a cash budget So now I mean I have I don't remember what it is now four hundred dollars for the month let's say And uh I mean some months I may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else and some months it may be different It's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves you know down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing but the way we set up you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for you know uh utilities and uh the house payment and all that those are things you don't really have much control over Uh the cash budget just fits right in there like I said if we don't have we also set aside money for entertainment I mean but again it's a set amount every month And uh on special occasions I mean birthdays and things like that we still have fun on things Well no not originally because   when we did buy  + when we bought  our first house it was at a time where you and the kind of loan we got you really didn't have to put down anything So we got into it fairly cheaply and then uh after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house So we got out of that one pretty easily Sure I know That's how I feel sometimes about my kids' education I mean jeez they are one and four We have got a long time to save my husband he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually Oh no no What do you do with it I know Uh-huh right Oh yeah Yeah it's amazing how much we spend on some things My husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work And that's all he has he has a ten dollar bill I mean so I'd say at least two usually three times a week he takes his lunch The other times he'll uh I don't know go out somewhere eat in a cafeteria or whatever but he keeps himself on that I mean he found it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch That's a hundred dollars a month on lunch that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch When he can take a sandwich you know
