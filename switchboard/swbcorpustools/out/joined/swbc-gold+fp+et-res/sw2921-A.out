What part of the country are you in Oh you are East or west I'm from Pittsburgh listen Yeah Um the South Hills area Beaver County well originally Beaver County And uh where are you from Oh okay I know where that is Yeah that's pretty out there What well Oh okay yeah I got my brother and my whole family there I'm talking to you from Dallas right now Uh-huh No my husband does And how about you place that needed this listen--not sure who's saying what Well that's okay I guess it's an easy thing to do So you have a big do you have a rural house or what do you have Oh that's a Those are beautiful Uh-huh Yeah is it a working farm or is it more I can understand that that's probably what I would uh Yeah I can hear the accent now I hear the Western Pennsylvania um uh we lived in Minneapolis for about five years we originally lived in Dallas and we met and got married and then um actually married in Pittsburgh and that's not what they want to hear on this call uh at any rate we came back here with my husband was transferred around uh up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T I and we're leasing a uh two story town home in a section of Dallas they call North Dallas And it's uh near a little town called Plano well it's not little any more Uh yes that's out near the airport That's about forty-five miles from us It's yeah That's why we're not sure we want to uh buy down here because actually we lived up north long enough to appreciate the um listen--one utt Minneapolis-Saint Paul is very clean you know in terms of listen; with previous slash unit and in terms of housing down here um you really have your pick but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy It really is I mean we're in a leased town home and uh your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking it's nine hundred a month But you know what if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living you know the big apartment complexes and I just have no tolerance for that No I pre- slash error That's right slash error Yeah but like the town home we're in I don't know how I mean we 2 utts it's like a duplex like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh And it's nice but I mean the girl bought it for a hundred and ten and now she can't sell it And our neighbors Yeah I mean our neighbors the attached on the other side they're very nice thank God they paid fifty-eight for it That's how bad it I know That's right Uh-huh yeah I have some friends that live in Westport and it's really really bad I mean you Uh-huh where is Clarion County in relation to actually because we're considering moving to Pennsylvania That's not too bad That's north Are you going up toward uh uh I'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an M Bradford no that's too far north So you're not that far north then okay Well you're really not too bad Yeah Um was it a home that you've had for quite a few years or that you've Oh then you have yeah Do you have a lot of land or Oh my well then There you go Did you have a hard time getting used to do you feel like you live in an isolated area or Yeah I think that that's um I can remember in Pittsburgh when this has to do with homes uh indirectly but I can remember when Upper Saint Clair was out in you know the rural end of Washington and now it's a terrible connection Oh well that's okay um but sub- yeah substantially you know Um do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that How big is it How many square feet do you have Well how many rooms do you think yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh A junk room yeah I understand we have that too that's large if your children aren't at home any more That's large if your kids aren't at home any more Uh-huh It's enough space for two people Yeah Oh okay Yeah right That's okay Well we've got um this town house is pretty big It's about eighteen hundred square feet It's got three bedrooms two and a half baths um it's really nice Yeah it is I mean I would never buy it but leasing it is fine Um but it's just again the privacy you know Um we had a house in Minneapolis that was on three acres and my husband was raised um on a working farm near Dayt- right near Dayton Ohio and he said you know he's slowly getting me to um not feel isolated if we move to where there's more land Right Uh-huh That's kind of what like his parents have uh land that they retired to um about a hundred miles out of Atlanta in Georgia and it is too far south for me um um but I mean they have one of the um when they said log cabin I just laughed that they retired to but they built one of these I mean it's just beautiful It's like a custom you know it's not like what I would think of when I think of old log cabins You know I mean it's modern it's Right right it's modern it's beautiful it's country it's you know um but uh I don't what else about housing except it's uh well Pittsburgh's housing economy I think it's holding it's own what sections are they in Yeah that's nice Great Uh-huh Uh-huh That's yeah a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills and they've been in their house oh probably about twelve years now and um it's you know they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon Um but it's a beautiful home and I mean my brother lives is it called Baldwin or Bebble I mean he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon um it's real pretty up there It's just And the neighborhoods are stable you know It's uh when you come to this part of the country we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing Oh my goodness Uh-huh That's what it is here yeah that's why we're at a point now uh we're adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what happens is uh you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get <> we'll be staying in So slash error Yeah that's kind of like where we're so we're considering Pennsylvania and we're just kind of you know toying with what exactly where we want to be you know A lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house but I disagree with that I Uh-huh I know and the economy here in Dallas I mean it's steady but it's still not going up And um I just refuse to buy it um if I know I'm not going to be there for at least five years uh you know Oh I'm sure yeah there I mean you can go down a street and here he told you this every other house you know if it's been foreclosed on or you know even big executives um it's really I mean and it's hard to sell the properties People from J C Penney's from New York came here about a couple of years ago And they thought they were getting a great deal um because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with they call it zero lot lines no property Jean slash errors; why is the name isolated And it would make you ill to see this I mean it would probably be like your house on uh you know a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something Yeah I know and that's you know like I can look outside right now and look into the next unit You know it's across the way and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas but it's still not that private Yeah but you have a rider No and your kids have to tell you the truth um I think that if you can keep that way you know kind of like a homestead
