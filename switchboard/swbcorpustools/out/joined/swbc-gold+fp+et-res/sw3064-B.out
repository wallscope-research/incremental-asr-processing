I do and I wish I didn't Before I got married uh about the only credit cards I used were gas cards because I didn't like carrying you know the cash with me all the time but I just never wanted to get into the hang-up of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head In fact I remember getting my first MasterCard and the only reason I got it was you know there was a while years ago when you couldn't cash a check without like a MasterCard or VISA And so that's why I went ahead and got one It was a mistake Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah That's right Uh-huh I know how that goes and I mean I have to say I have been thankful for them because there were times when it was just like that when we had to have the money we had no way around it and the only way to do it is go get you know an advance on a card and so like you were paying for it but it's one of those I'm glad it was there Oh I see Oh What Do you find now though that even some doctors won't I've found some doctors that say you know I was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards and so many of them don't anymore So Yeah Right Right Oh it is <> I know Right But you know the interest even though it bothered me it didn't used to bother me so much because of course you could list it on a Schedule A and you got all your interest you know towards your tax deductions and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it but it is easy to get into a credit card problem and I think about young people that think you know there's kind of that feeling of hey it's so neat I have my first credit card and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments You know That's right That's right That's right Right Right Right No and that's frightening to me That's right That's frightening too Uh my husband is in business for himself I work for T I but he doesn't and uh I've kind of got my fingers crossed I've learned when you're in business for yourself that you don't count on something until it's happened you know but you know it's those once in a lifetime cases and after ten years he's got two of them and they should pay through next month and we're both just looking at each other every night going man that will pay off like both of our MasterCards you know And you know just in one lump because that's the only way you can do it is to have a big chunk of money or it's like you say you pay forever And so I'm really looking forward to that That's right Right Sure yeah I agree That's right I know and I know You're like what am I working for today It's incredible Boy I wish I could say that my house and well my car is paid for now It was wrecked three weeks ago but you see again the credit cards came in handy I had to have the money to pay rental car pay this pay that till the insurance company pays back And uh Yeah Because you know that's coming back to pay it off Right It's Sure That's right That's right Well the smart half was don't pay it for consumables you know if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash don't put it on a credit card you know and so that is the smart half uh and I can remember before we had kids we did that a lot but it was no biggie you know because we could pay it off while after kids and you're paying child care and other things all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off so we cut that out real quick uh but I do like having them there There is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis they are there to use but you have to have a very good sense of saving or common sense not to get yourself in trouble Uh-huh
