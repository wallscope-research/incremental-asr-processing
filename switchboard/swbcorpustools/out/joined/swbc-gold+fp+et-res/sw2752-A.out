How bad is it Do you have smog like they do in California Uh-huh It depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion I take it Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh What do you think is your primary cause of it You do You really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas Uh-huh Um my goodness Uh-huh I think a lot of it's industrial I also think uh that uh there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles but it's mostly from older automobiles I don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting uh frankly I think that uh I think that uh uh if uh I I I heard a story a while back something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off the road that have been uh manufactured say before nineteen seventy-five that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining Yeah From from cars that is not not total but just from cars okay So that I think would be tremendous help But I happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical and it just keeps getting uh gives me good service and I don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money On the other hand I know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars I have But I don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies And uh that may be part of the problem Als- Yeah {pause} yeah yeah oh uh yeah it's it's uh pretty heavy up here I think but I think it's mostly industrial is what I really uh believe is the the main problem And and uh {pause} and uh uh people uh I don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should I I we we seem to have a high uh cancer rate up here in Maryland Yeah and uh Well for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant and uh I think of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody but uh th- this state was like the second my wife's a registered nurse and I think this state was like second this year from the top in terms of uh cancer rate for just all kinds And I can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution I just don't know exactly what it necessarily is but I just can't believe it is Now we have a lot of pollution being caused by cloruph- uh fluorocarbons which is the like freon twelve and freon twenty-two They use freon twenty-two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer And I can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also and having all kinds of effects and Well they're working now I know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working uh feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons and who ever does is going to make uh a mint Because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons then uh Well they used to be but they made them take it out of that Right No they they they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers and that was a move in the right direction We are doing some things to try to correct the problem But there are more things we could do and getting rid of old cars like I said is one way to help correct the problem Uh uh just trying to I think be careful uh with the way you handle garbage I notice in this state I don't know if you're doing it in Texas yet or not but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces uh you know containers in yeah Yeah well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too But they uh in one of the counties here they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police They have a lady that goes around like a meter maid and she spot checks people's trash And if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash they'll fine you fifty bucks I think the first time and two fifty the second time Yeah you right you've got to get people to see i- and surprisingly enough just handling of trash uh can cut pollution uh from uh uh from just throwing it in a dump or or or where ever else they used to do with it maybe used to burn it They've stopped that up here too But that that will cut pollution too Because you get a lot of out gassing from these things I think decaying and tr- and trying to for instance cans and bottles they never go away at all But on on the other hand I don't guess they're polluting But plastic containers and the like uh they may be I'm not sure of that Oh I think that's very important to do I I really think that uh trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very very important thing And uh that can help to cut pollution I guess some I I don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air I would hope that they would help some though That's for sure  Uh-huh Oh good Well that uh that I think may go on a lot and the primary reason I think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happened to stay up late at night or something I don't think we have a adequate policing uh particularly on industry Uh we have good policing at least in this state and and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too of car pollutants because we have to go down uh once a year here in Maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content Uh-huh Uh no we don't have a state inspection but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state I don't know uh that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities But in this state we have to uh pay eight dollars and a half and go to a an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are have been made starting in nineteen seventy-three No no we don't have inspections like that Now I'm in Maryland in Virginia they check that every two years I think And I think that's a good idea too not no- not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily but I think it's a good idea The emission check though is required in Maryland and it's also required in Virginia uh a sister state to to this one And that's that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants Uh-huh well if they don't I would imagine in time they'll get a law with i- get around to it and if they don't then that's something I would certainly uh uh suggest you be willing to uh uh be for in terms of uh Yeah yeah Oh yeah I I agree Now that's another area we haven't even discussed and that is water pollution and various of the other types of uh of uh like food pollution I mean you you hardly ever hear hear anybody say anything about food pollution But I think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries so uh hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of uh pollutants in our food But water pollution uh I've worried especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like I know a lot more people are going to bottled water Yeah tap yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course have it checked because it seems uh when I was a kid growing up down south uh I used to go out in the country where my grandparents were and we had a well it was one of those draws that I forget what you call those things and and that was some of the best tasting water I mean I can still to this day taste that water Yeah Uh-huh Oh I bet it was Yeah the- once it's been filtered an if it's a deep enough well filtered through all the earth and everything I think that uh it depends of course where you are A good well though I think is very healthy
