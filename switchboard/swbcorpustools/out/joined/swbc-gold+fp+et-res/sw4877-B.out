Uh-huh How old are your children Uh-huh Well they're going to be getting there Yeah uh-huh Oh I see I have uh five children I have a eighteen year old son The rest of my girls are like twenty-three twenty-six twenty-eight and twenty-nine And I have three granddaughters right now And uh I uh one's in Iowa And uh she's a teacher and what she does is she teaches at a preschool and so she kind of and they let her bring her little daughter in for free so but she just works part-time Then I have another daughter in uh Bountiful Utah and she has to work full-time and it's just tearing her apart She has a private baby-sitter And uh the baby just screams I mean the baby is like seventeen months and she just screams Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there They're not even there yet you know and then uh uh I have a seven month old granddaughter and uh her mother stays home and they live with us You know as Orange County is really expensive They live with us and so of course we love it Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time But uh uh she just uh she used to work in the preschool and child care and she says after working in there and you know here she was a provider but you know there's only so much one person can do She said it's so awful She said she'll never put her child in a preschool I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere But it's really very difficult and Well when uh the see first ten or twelve years I stayed home And uh then after that I went to work And uh uh uh a couple of times I just uh uh you know then I had one job and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job and then like later I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter Supposed to be good uh recommended person from the church and I knew her personally She had two kids of her own and everything But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child I mean first of all uh her children were sick all the time So when my son stayed over there he got sick same thing that her kids had right And so uh we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock Then she'd take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten But s- that day uh I was saying now he's sick And well she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have That's what he got you know Goes well okay so it's not like he's going to infect her kids But then what happened is I said uh he just threw up and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty so she said well she'll keep him home and he'll probably just sleep anyway Well you know what that woman sent him to kindergarten She sent him to kindergarten As soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him and he threw up again and uh they put him in the nurse's office And then what happened is you know they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter Called her and they said uh that he's sick Well she wasn't home I mean all her kids were sick but she wasn't home right and her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick Now why didn't she keep him home with her No she didn't do that So it got to the point where he's supposed to get out of uh kindergarten like about two thirty And I had to leave work it was five o'clock in the evening and I found out he was still there at school And they were calling me and they said somebody's got to pick him up And I kept thinking that she was going to pick him up because she only lives like two blocks away from the school I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff And he had a hundred and four fever They couldn't uh give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything I was so furious I quit that job and I stayed home for awhile longer Then I went and got uh a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better Yeah but uh I haven't had any really very good experience with child care
