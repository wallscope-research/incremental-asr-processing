Never I've never been served on the jury never been called up in a jury although some of my friends have been jurors You haven't huh If you were uh what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers I think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury and to get to trial And I don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or what but uh Sometimes I think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion Hence is possible error as you can see in all the IRONSIDES T V shows No I think there are certain things that uh the jury can determine as far as uh guilty or not guilty but as far as the affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature I don't know if that is best left up to the jury to award you know Two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing you know it's true that you know this may be sad and all that thing but uh the jury I think is best in most cases suited for determination of guilt and innocence but not the award of penalties and fines and punishment Uh-huh that's true But uh I do like the idea of the jury being the people who decide in the matter of uh if it's a jail term versus life and death you know the death penalty and such Uh-huh Right Yeah Uh it's kind of difficult and I guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in jail although you still hear about those occasionally Um I don't know you know I heard a very interesting and maybe it's just the T V show or movie I was watching they were going through a trial and I think it was like on one of the documentary T V shows where they ask for the verdict by the jury and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent And they took it more as just like a majority So I Exactly but they took you know whatever the majority was So I didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is I always thought it had to be unanimous But uh Rather interesting Uh-huh I did also Uh-huh What about in international trials Do you think they should have a jury there I think that would be kind of interesting I guess the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts like you know the old day with the rack they're going to say Okay you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars Well whose going to really make them Nobody But I think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of you know people from different countries uh in as international law also Uh-huh Right I don't know what it would take to come up with a true perfect system or if one exists But Uh is that the crime and it's already some chart and determine the punishment or Uh-huh I think there should be a core minimum that they get but uh I guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature But Yeah that serves a kind of if they're I guess uh if you sentence someone to life life is only forty-nine years something like that And I guess you're eligible after twenty-seven for parole even though you're in for life Yeah although I guess it's you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time No Because uh inside the jail I don't think there's no real rehabilitation Yeah it's another war zone But who knows I agree get them out there Sure they should have them go out and doing stuff Cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what Something for the state since the state is paying for them they should get some kind of work out of them Exactly Trading their lives for cigarettes those kinds of things Well good I think so Nice talking to you also Have a wonderful Easter Bye
