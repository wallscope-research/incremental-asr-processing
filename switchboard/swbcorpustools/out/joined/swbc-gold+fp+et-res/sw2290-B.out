So are you a freshwater or Freshwater Uh-huh Most of my fishing has been in the saltwater Uh mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish and uh I have caught one or two small sharks and uh yes Put them back No no no I love shark steak but uh the ones I caught were never large enough to really do anything Is there a limit I have no idea I know I my home is in uh Pensacola Florida so they do a lot of shark fishing you know in the gulf and um there's a certain period of time during the year all along the gulf coast I guess from Galveston to Mayport they have uh shark tournaments and you know there's part either as part of or separate from the uh bill fishing tournaments they usually have so I have not done uh much you know lake fishing for bass and so forth but uh maybe some what they call brim and those sorts of things but nothing I think I've been trout fishing once I've never fly fished Have you fly fished I've tried it once yes uh a friend of mine no I could never get the hang of it Uh-huh I usually ended snagging my uh fishing partners or the trees along the bank Yes Almost got an owl once But uh Oh no no no no uh when I was uh working in Florida I used to do a lot of surf fishing mostly for relaxation you know there are people who fish and then there are people who catch Well I'm a fisher That's right I've never caught that much but uh Oh and occasionally we'd go out on a you know full day trip you know three or four other people and do either again bottom fishing or for grouper or you know I've caught a few worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth What about you a Uh-huh Oh yes The last time I went uh bass fishing I was with my daughter a friend of hers and well a friend of mine and his daughter I was the only one who did not catch a single fish my daughter caught fish his daughter caught fish he caught fish I did not even I was out on a party boat a few years ago and we were grouper fishing or you know actually we were uh snapper fishing Everyone on the boat was catching snappers except guess who I That's right I would go from one side of the boat to the other and uh uh the party boat captain could not understand you know even he started baiting my hook and holding uh the fishing rod Right and it was really really really bad Uh as I said I am a fisher I'm not a catcher But uh I enjoy it though I don't really get out as much uh as I would like too And they do of course you know here in we're you know forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in Maryland and they do a lot of fishing there Of course what I used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays uh or for oysters And uh that I was able to do when I could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom That right Uh-huh Uh-huh Um Uh-huh Uh-huh Well we used to I guess the weirdest thing I've ever caught is uh in some of the inlets and the rivers around Delaware They have a fish that's called an oyster cracker I don't know if you've ever heard of it and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters Uh-huh and this is the ugliest fish I have ever seen I mean and they come in all si- you know I've caught them from you know three or four inches long up to uh I guess the largest one I ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things just terrible No no they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them Uh-huh Well the first time I went surf fishing was in and I threw my line out and the first thing I caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot and a half or uh two feet long and scared me to death I had never seen anything and then I fished for another half hour or forty-five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth and then I felt something relatively heavy and I thought oh here I'm really going to get one And I
