Okay Well gosh all kinds um mostly between the ages of two and ten Um like a few summers ago I kept two children every day for the entire summer and I mean they became like my children um and they live in an apartment complex so we swam a lot and we played on the playground a lot and then we would go to a movie on Thursdays and um there was always an activity you know they had their favorite T V shows and things like that that we watched and then we took naps and um I don't know it just seems like there was always something to do Children are so full of energy And oh they just keep you going Uh one parent Yeah She's just Not much at all I mean I would get there at eight o'clock in the morning the children usually weren't awake by then And she would get home at like five thirty in the afternoon And they would have dinner and then it was time for them to go to bed Um now at this particular time the children were two and six But then I also I've been baby-sitting this child uh for about eight years he's nine now and um you know I've watched him grow up and he's like a little brother to me And it's changed over the years um we get along a lot better now that he's older And uh we do different things now we used to play ball a lot but now it's he likes to watch T V and he's into wrestling And um I kept him on Friday night we went to go see a movie and um things like that but I feel like I don't know when I have children I want to be able to spend a lot of time with them Uh-huh I go to L S U Uh communications Oh yeah I mean I love children Um I don't know seem when I was growing up my Mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high And I don't I think it was very beneficial to us I mean like in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books and we went skating a lot and you know she was just always there for us but nowadays if there are two parents to a family the mother works just as hard as the father does and the children either stay at home and get into trouble or they're stuck in a day care And I just don't want my children to have to be raised like that All my friends their parents worked all the time they got to stay at home by themselves and when I was younger I thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things like I couldn't ride my bike across the street but they could because they're Mom would never know it But now I realize that it was better because um they have got into a lot of trouble because of lack of supervision Uh-huh Well I'm majoring in uh public relations Yeah Yes ma'am Right Uh-huh Well I would like to uh stay at home with my children for at least the first five years But what I plan to do in the future is um go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters and work on my doctorate and teach um college and in that case then I'll be at home when my children are at home but I'd like to stay at home with them until they get at least into kindergarten where they're at school from what eight to three or something and then I would be at my school teaching And um Oh really What grade Oh did you What did you teach Oh oh I started out as a P E major in education I wanted to be a P E teacher I sure did Oh yeah Uh-huh Absolutely Oh Yeah That's right They need some attention Well see whenever my Mom stayed home with us we did without a lot I mean we were it's hard to make it on one income but we did and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years And um you know we only had one car we only had one telephone you know we didn't get to eat out all the time but I feel like that it helped me now because I appreciate the value of the dollar and um I also had the supervision that I needed while I was growing up and I hope that I can provide that for my child too Oh we have Uh-huh It is It's way too late I agree It is Because all the peer pressure it starts in high school and the parent really needs to be there for the child Oh great Yeah Uh-huh Well I guess that was good that you were hearing it from other students Well um Does your son work for T I Oh Oh goodness
