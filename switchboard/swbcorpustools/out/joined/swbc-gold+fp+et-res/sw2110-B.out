Okay well go ahead I'll let you start Uh-huh Right yeah Uh-huh or it could be like the draft where you know before they draft you uh you get a physical anyway So when they send you a draft notice and they give you a physical and if there's nothing physically wrong with you then you're drafted It doesn't matter how rich you are That would be good What did you say Oh yeah Uh Uh-huh that's true Well that's true America's paying all this money to have other people give uh aid to other countries so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time Because actually when you do uh service overseas you end up learning something usually that's really useful plumbing or farming or something like that so you're really learning a skill <> What did you say Uh-huh Yeah I think well that's probably the idea I don't know whether the idea is to be within the country or outside the country Yeah that would be neat yeah sort of like an exchange program Uh-huh Yeah that'd be sort of neat I like the idea of uh being uh a mandatory thing for welfare Course that's what um that's sort of like what Truman had or was it Roosevelt I can't remember um with the big Yeah Getting people uh the work program and all the make work jobs That was sort of public service in a way all the highways they started building What did you say Yeah that's true a lot of them are still out there Like all these wonderful highways in West Virginia and no one knows why Lake what Caddo Lake No I've never heard of it Oh Oh okay real pretty like a swamp oh yeah Oh okay yeah I been uh I uh talked to someone else before that was uh a Texan but I guess uh that's what we're going to have This is uh a T I experiment to see how talk/ Texans talk to other people Uh Virginia Oh yeah it is neat to get other people Especially since you got other uh ideas about uh how people react to things and stuff Especially when it comes to um social services Uh uh I'm glad they have a lot of uh um you know topics on social services because like this thing this is a pretty good idea I didn't even know if they were thinking about it/ I wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone somewhere is really thinking that uh it would be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service Politicians pushing it Or Mitch Snider Oh okay well see that's a D C thing Mitch Snider is the advocate for the homeless that uh he's said it out here in Washington but he started um uh the movement for creative nonviolence Yeah he started that and that was basically a you know donate time and money to uh help the homeless but uh Excus- uh the other topic was like I said uh something about politicians I can't remember exactly what it was It was real general statement Gee whiz yeah Yeah Uh-huh that would be neat I'd have to basically say my birth humor Uh-huh Well that would be sort of interesting because then you get people from I mean other parts of the state you know of course Pittsburgh would say you know oh find the better cheaper ways of burning coal you know Cleaner ways of burning coal and people in the South would say don't burn coal you know Oh we have a lot of coal But uh uh it's a dirty fuel that's for sure Excuse me How did I get into it oh I'm an electrical engineer here in Virginia No Uh no they I'm in a telecommunications company and they uh sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers wanted to participate you know Um not really I mean no more than any other company you know we buy their parts just as much as anybody else But uh no real association with T I other than being in the same electronics industry uh they just sent out a letter to everybody they do business with saying that you know if you're interested we're doing a study and since I don't know no I don't Right What do you think what Get Oh I don't know you're going to get you own T I seven thirty-two or something Oh I didn't hear about that Probably for T I employees Oh your not typo your> you're you don't work for Texas Instruments Oh okay Oh Oh Oh oh that's a neat idea Uh-huh yeah well he's gotten a good mix I was saying because I've like I said I heard some other people talking that they've talked to different people in different states and stuff That's good especially since you call that one eight hundred number so probably knock T I profits margin way down Yeah right this is probably some government study program/ Okay Okay well I enjoyed talking with you I'm going to save my two year old from the pile of grapes she's diving into Okay I'll talk to you Bye-bye
