Well we talk about it but I'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and tries to somehow make the ends meet which uh Um yes Yes I don't mind the spending it's just that trying to get what you need out of what you have That seems to be our challenge I see Well I'm at home also so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary uh Well we pretty well do Um several years we didn't and we found that we just weren't making the most of what we had and so we um set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for you know just our bills And then what's left we divvy up We try to save a little bit although we're not always successful and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs Yeah Right Right Uh-huh Right Yeah Right Well we had new cars um always until about four years ago my husband um owned his own company and it went under and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment and now it just seems just such a large amount of money to spend that we do have a used car well he has a company car also but for our personal car we have a used car Um do you think that it's wiser to buy used Right Uh-huh Oh no Uh-huh That's right Wow Right Do you um buy from dealers or from individuals Right Right Yeah
