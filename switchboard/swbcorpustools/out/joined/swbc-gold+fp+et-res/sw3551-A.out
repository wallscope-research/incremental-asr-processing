How big is Provo That a little town or a bigger city Oh I talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town I think Yeah I forgot the name of the town I thought maybe it was you Oh well anyway we're supposed to talk about education I certainly have some ideas since I'm studying it now in college I'd say first of all they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading writing arithmetic in grade school because they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to and it shows up That's one idea Do you have any Uh-huh Yeah it's Plano uh improved greatly in the last twenty twenty-five years that's for sure It used to be the pits And Arlington is excellent now but I'm just speaking overall across the country Something is definitely wrong And uh one thing they don't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year and they truly can't read so I don't know how they expect them to uh pass history when they can't read anything you know even read a word problem in math So um that's definitely a problem Another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do But um That is good about well it depends on where you are They're all so different That's another thing about the United States There's no national curriculum you know I mean what they'd be teaching in an Arlington school they may not be teaching in a Plano school and in the same school district even in an Arlington seventh grade for instance you may have an English class you may have half literature for the whole year whereas in another one they're going to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature it's up to the teacher in other words So you know that's kind of odd to me It depends on uh what school you're in and who your teacher is actually or is how you end up Overall Arlington is good one of the better ones in the state so I guess we lucked out when we moved here Uh-huh Of course we have a slight problem in that uh the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point and uh you know where our kids might be in a great school we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read you know So I don't know I just read about that the other day and I had never even thought of it Actually it makes sense to a certain extent because sometimes like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didn't even learn what uh they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach you know and according to her plan so I guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn But uh We actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes you know that's pretty low that there's forty-eight countries ahead of us that have more citizens percentage wise that can read and write so um unless we want to keep paying for these people that can't make it in society we're going to have to do something I don't know Obviously nobody's smart enough to have figured it out yet so I probably can't But I do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write because they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays you know Uh you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had to get a message or something you know or fill out an application to work at McDonalds if you can't read So uh I think that's a start at least going back to the basics in the early grades and um they say that the average English student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago and that's a big jump Did you go to school in Plano Through high school
