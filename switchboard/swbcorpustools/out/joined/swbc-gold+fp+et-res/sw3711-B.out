Well That is like my favorite hobby So yeah I would travel everywhere and I have been all over Europe and a lot of the United States and Hawaii and So when I can that is what I do Well I am not sure Uh I guess Hawaii is one of my favorite places Yeah Well no that is exciting You know I have been several times so after the first time it is like anywhere You know it loses that newness but yeah I love it I love to go over to Europe I do and mostly I travel through Germany and Switzerland and we have good friends in England so I have been there quite a bit and I just love it all I love to look at the different people and the different cultures and to see how different they are from things are from the way we do them The most interesting part more than the museums and things like that So how about you Uh-huh Oh no Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right That would be quite a project Yeah Well it would be a lot fun You know there is good and there is bad and my experience in Italy was not my favorite for sure But Well I flew into Milan My daughter is uh a twirling champion and she had to perform over there in Turin and so we had to fly into Milan and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the Italians even if they speak English they do not want to let you know and they gave us all the wrong directions and there were just two of us At the airport they put us on the wrong bus Finally we saw a policeman He put us on the subway We sat there uh we did not know Italian We looked at each other We said things like spaghetti <> You know things like that We finally followed some kids who told us where to get off We followed these kids with uh gym bags and we figured that must be the sports arena and we lucked out and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground I mean It was kind of a nightmare But that was our experience and I guess all of Italy is not like that But where we were it certainly was and the hotel that we stayed in we stayed with our English friends their team in the hotel and it was beautiful It was very modern But it was very far away on a bus So you know uh it was interesting You always learn something And you always have a fun experience so it is great You know Uh-huh No I have not Huh-uh Our friends live like an hour outside of England like Ash around there So uh-huh
