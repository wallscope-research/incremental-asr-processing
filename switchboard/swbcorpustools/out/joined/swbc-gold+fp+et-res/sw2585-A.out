Hello Well I think it's a very very complicated and I sort of see perspectives on all sides Um and I've no hope for solutions But uh I do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue I have worked uh uh a little bit with refugees from Southeast Asia uh who've come over Uh you know to escape the genocide programs that are over there And you know heard about some of the problems that they've had/ And I'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be Because I in general like a smaller rather than a larger population to the land area And uh I'm in California which has a lot of immigration Probably more than any where else in the country though I'm not sure if that's the case Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah Sure well Texas used to be part of Mexico or most of it Huh I don't either It's a really delicate uh moral issue Because if you have well I guess the one thing I do see is that needs to be a solution is that if you do let people into the country I do feel you have a certain obligation to get them on their feet Because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in and you're dooming them to being underclass people You know you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever And I know that the Southeast Asians the Hmong people that I've done some work with uh feel very quite hurt and unsure of themselves when here Because they're coming you know from the slash and burn intercultural society you know they're coming from the middle ages basically And they're being plunked down into America Many of them had been promised by the C I A during the war over there that because they co-operated with the C I A and they helped the C I A out that when they came here the C I A would help establish them in America and the C I A of course isn't doing that And uh so they come here and they don't know what the heck they're doing And they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities And of course there are people in the big cities who would like nothing better than to take advantage of them And they're incredible victims of crime And part of it is this lack of basic information being dissimilated And I'm not saying it's easy to do and I know there are a few people who are trying but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on Uh yeah exactly Y- ha- I mean these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what America's like Um and it's ver- it's I couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until I met with them And I realized that some of the information that I just you know don't even realize and know is information they don't have And I never thought well I guess that is something you need to know you know People getting into trouble because they come here and so they start farming on uh available land you know Like the median strips on freeways because no one's using it But then someone comes along and says you can't do that you know Why can't they They have no idea why not some of them you know The ones that have been here longer and have been in you know understand now But when they initially come over Yeah 'cause they're farmers These are all farmers coming over and they're being put in the middle of the city I mean they're nomadic farmers you know they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside These are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before You know these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war And uh they have you know So I do have a lot of sympathy for them and I feel that America could try a little bit harder to help people adjusting to the American way Because if they don't you know you're going to produce an underclass you know You're going to get a situation that I think a lot like what happened to the blacks being sort of led out of slavery and then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then And there was no real upward movement And not being you know Um Well I wasn't helping them I worked with them not to help them but for my own purposes/ I'm a linguist and I was uh trying to learn their language a little bit And I actually um I mean helped them in the sense that they received money for working with me But I wasn't a social worker or anything like that I do have friends who have tried to do more social work you know by explaining to people how the language and what the problems learning English might be and such Because all the models of teaching English are based on teaching English to Spanish speakers or to other European language speakers And people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are Oh you are Uh-huh well you that's been my impression Yeah they're not withholding information they just don't have that information they haven't the foggiest idea Yes And Spanish is pretty close to English really And Spanish is a lot like English Yeah Yeah yeah Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh I'm sure it would Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah it would be a good experience and you'd be helping people I'm sure Very much and I mean not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but I do know the Asian groups are having a lot of trouble I mean and part of the problem is that a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from you know decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth They became a very successful immigrant group but a lot of people coming over from Vietnam right now coming from worn torn countries are not having the same success I think some people have just assumed well why can't you be successful The Japanese were or the Chinese were or something And it's really much more complicated Yeah the times are different yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah I think it's a wonderful thing to do And there's a lot more I guess another possible solution is since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it uh more of the volunteer network service Because everyone gains from it Would be would might be really useful Uh and if it's you know uh just people helping people I think makes the community so much happier Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh uh-huh Yes yes I've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country I mean and they're highly educated people but of course if you're educated and you don't speak English no one thinks anything of you Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah I do too Well It's been good talking with you Uh okay Okay it does sound like you have some children to take care of Uh Okay bye-bye
