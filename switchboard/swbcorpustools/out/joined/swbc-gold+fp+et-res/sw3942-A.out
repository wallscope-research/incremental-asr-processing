Well the topic's about government Uh I'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic Uh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I + I  think that the last uh part of that question was particularly interesting uh about uh uh uh or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal uh because it seems to me that when uh government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical codes uh parallel to the legal codes that uh we're focusing on the wrong thing maybe that's what is happening Maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past you know ten to twenty years that uh it becomes more evident Perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or you know et cetera like that and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons And I couldn't help thinking it was a funny question when that last part of the question came about how many things can we uh actually put a legal code on uh how much uh should it be our uh prerogative to see into the private lives of these people You know Um That's right Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh I + I  agree with that uh and also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's you know going to the public uh then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience And uh you kn- when it becomes public though it becomes scandalous that's + that's  the thing that uh things that you don't know uh do + do  not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray People could say oh they do it so I guess you know but as soon as things do get public uh there is that terrible concern So sometimes I ask myself what are uh people doing that are in the media when somebody you know comes up to office it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines It's a very low way of living Uh so and + and  + and  as far as uh you know myself having any particular personal uh knowledge or insight into politics or politicians I'm not terribly involved in it Just in a very cursory way I vote and I you know try to do whatever I can on the little local area but I + i-  + it  just is not one of the things that I have uh placed uh uh a lot of my particular time and effort into so I always feel very outside uh this kind of an issue But uh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah right Yeah uh Uh uh-huh I'm not in there I'm not one of those uh you know volunteers that's down at headquarters and whatever uh although I admire the people that do that and they certainly do get inside information and uh of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing the more you can trust their judgment and their insight But the media insight as you said I just kind of read and kind of be aware and then uh I don't like to make a whole lot of uh judgment myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that uh
