Yeah Exactly Oh Did you do the diagnosis or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I know uh when working with the uh flashers there is uh usually a a special fuse that operates the flashers Do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam Diagram Yeah I don't even know if my current cars have a separate fuse I know sometimes when you think there are things running while they're at the same unit like the headlamp you tend to think well there's one fuse operating the whole thing but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires uh the use of a of a maybe a higher fuse So that's a possibility Is this a a mail order parts house that specializes in in parts for parts for uh old imports Who Um so it's not J C Whitney or somebody like that Yeah have you found any uh uh reliable import service people in the metroplex Oh yeah Uh-huh I'll be darned Uh-huh Oh my goodness  Oh no Well ours wasn't within the last year I guess it's been within the last two years uh Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new and it's one with the uh electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer and uh I don't know what else it all controls but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort and we found that the uh uh we were having two problems It was idling fast when you first started the engine to the point that we park on a hill under our car port and it when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley and knowing that you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard otherwise it would just wrench control away from you And the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would uh be driving along uh decelerating like coming to a stop sign but not yet stopped at the stop sign and the engine would just quit So we took it back to the uh Oldsmobile place and asked them to check it out and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing so they adjusted timing and the problem didn't go away so we ended up taking it back again and I don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around but the second time around they looked at their uh recall service and their service reports from region or headquarters whatever and and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the uh computer control unit which fortunately they replaced under warranty because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part and uh so once they replaced it then the the car seemed to work fine for a considerable period of time and now it seems to be we don- we're not experiencing the stalling but we're still experiencing a very uneven
