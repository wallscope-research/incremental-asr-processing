I uh get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio Uh that is one of my big sources for current events information Uh I really like that coverage My wife uh on the other hand is home most of the day and she watches a lot of the cable news network uh have you uh ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I'm uh interested in the shortwave aspect of it Uh how do you find that the coverage from other places in the world uh compares with the American coverage of how do you think that uh the viewpoints differ Uh-huh Uh-huh Do you think then that uh the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts Uh-huh uh which approach do you find to be uh more useful the interpretive approach or the straight reporting Uh-huh Uh-huh One of the things that I found interesting last year during uh the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against uh Peter Arnett who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting uh some of the things that were available Uh there was uh a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a uh uh hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory and while he was being severely uh censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that you know this isn't a baby milk factory how could he say it was uh I think that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them
