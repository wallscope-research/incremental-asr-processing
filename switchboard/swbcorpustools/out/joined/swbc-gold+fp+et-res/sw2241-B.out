Well uh pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard Well uh we just bought our house uh last July and  it's the house is  forty years old so there's an established lawn and whatnot flower beds things like that but uh they've gone a few years of neglect So we're in the process of uh revitalizing the whole situation We've got um different flower beds in front and uh a built in window box um trying to get some color back in those get the trees trimmed up uh get rid of a few weed problems and things like that So Uh I live in Dallas Okay Yeah Uh-huh I'll bet I'll bet Right Right Yeah it's pretty high alk- w- actually it's done uh it's in the north end of Oak Cliff in uh Kessler Park area and uh we've got about yeah we've got maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil and then it's solid rock from then on down so Yeah it's uh a little aggravating we can't put in anything too big um as far as uh shrubs and things like that because they've got to get a chance to find the cracks in the rock But uh Yeah it is it's solid limestone Uh we're just happy that there's trees already there so far um anything like that is a uh major undertaking I guess uh sprinkler systems or anything uh start to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock But uh and it you know not even considering a pool or anything like that practically has to be blasted in I guess But uh and it makes for a different challenge I've never well I moved to Dallas about five years ago and uh I never really messed with anything uh gardening or anything like that until now but uh I keep hearing all the stories of different parts of town In fact uh we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that and the first thing the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said uh I've got a dozen different varieties and each one works in one part of town and that's it That's basically what he was trying to tell us Yeah Yeah it Yeah that wou- in fact we put in uh some more roses yesterday Uh a few different uh hybrid tea type varieties Yeah Okay Yeah Yeah that's what we're searching uh we've got all the different lake editions around the house and we're kind of experimenting right now we've got the direct sun in front and the backyard has two great big uh spruce and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall so the backyard is just complete dark all day long And uh we're struggling to find something for those areas No they're in pretty good condition Uh we've been pretty lucky on that Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah That's true That's true It's uh bermuda Yeah Okay Right Yeah Okay Uh-huh Yeah it's uh there's such a difference through the year Uh Uh-huh Uh-huh that's it Yeah Oh wow Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Okay Uh-huh Okay Oh okay Sure Uh-huh Wow That really is it would it seem like it be just the opposite when you get Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that's true that Yeah that's true That's true Uh-huh Yeah that's something I've uh been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are at this time of the year and you know we're trying to decide what to put on one side of the house and things like that but there's so many things that they last for just a couple of weeks then it's just a bush there from then on it's kind of disappointing Uh-huh Yeah
