Hi this is Laurie and I'm in Garland Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Well we don't have any children but we're going to have one next year Thanks So um that's something that I'm probably going to be looking at maybe in the future We haven't quite decided if I'm going to I'm working part time now and I don't know if I'll be doing that or what we're going to do But if we do then I'm going to need to find somebody and our church has a Mother's Day Out program which they started last year and we know a lot of people at the church so I would feel very confident with leaving my child there Uh-huh Uh-huh Okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Time uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Um you know it's kind of scary I guess because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately and so I guess it's such a growing concern but then there's a lot of good things you don't hear Right To  children Right Uh-huh Right Right Yeah Yeah We're pretty excited Yeah but you know we have been thinking about that but it's a little ways off in the future but um I figure you know I'd probably start asking around at church because I know they have a limit as to how old they can be you know before you can bring them in Uh-huh Um Right Uh-huh
