Well uh before I was married I used to play a lot of sports uh but when I got married and had children and everything it seems like I keep all my activity just chasing around fulfilling my obligations so I haven't done a lot of uh exercise on purpose What about you Oh really Uh-huh Oh no that can be awful Uh-huh Oh that's good Uh-huh Do you work out on like is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh I bet Uh-huh Uh-huh Um Doesn't sound like low impact Well Well that's good So are you moti- Well like I am undisciplined in the sense that I can't just go and do exercise but I like to uh play tennis and play racquetball I like to get exercise when I'm playing a game of some sort and so that's always been the way that I have kept myself in uh the shape that I was satisfied with at least And uh then I have given that up but uh I would really like to start that again because I am now you know not in a position that I like myself I don't feel good and I get you know when you get out of shape and you don't if you're easily tired and so that has made me but I'm not the kind of person that could go to a spa and work out I just if something like uh I mean I have so many chores and so many obligations every day for to add another obligation would make me feel stressed And I wouldn't enjoy it But if I have something some team sport or some activity then it's kind of like having fun playing and then you get some of the uh good exercise and some of the desired results but you're doing it for fun But I really admire people who can go and work out and Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that's nice Uh-huh Yes It is kind It is family and it's fun It's a fun thing and kids enjoy that and all And also the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation you know like saunas or you know uh hot Jacuzzis or whatever they have that kind of makes it fun and stuff you know you can relax that way afterwards and things Well I guess it's getting late And I should take off but uh I appreciate that that helped motivate me Think someone can do it Maybe I should start thinking about it again Yeah I bought one I went to the I bought the low impact first I thought I shouldn't out of the blue just jump in but I haven't done it But I'm going to try it Well you have a good night We'll see you Bye-bye
