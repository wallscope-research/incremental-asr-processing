Well are you a fisher person are you Great What kind of fishing do you do In California Oh Well what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods Uh-huh Oh Well I don't blame you I grew up in Nebraska and uh grew up cat fishing in the Little Blue River and then uh we moved to uh South Dakota and uh did a lot of Walleye fishing on the Missouri River and uh now that we are down here I think a lot of people do some uh bass fishing and strip bass fishing but uh uh I am sort of a catfish man at heart Yep Yeah they do Oh Yeah Oh yeah I like to fish The only problem is I just moved to Texas so it's been a little over a year now but uh I am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here and I really I haven't gone fishing for about two years now and it's driving me crazy but uh one of these days I will go over to uh Lake Lewisville or uh what is it uh Lake Ray Hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while Well yeah sure Well mo- Yeah Most of the time uh if we catch something we'll take it home and eat it Uh and you're right I mean I like to fish for trout and they are really uh uh good fighters but uh if I went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing I would order if I had a choice of fish on the menu Yeah Well uh so do you just uh uh skin your catfish or do you fillet them out how do you Do you Okay Yeah No Well that's how we do it too Uh although we uh use to set some uh trout lines out and we've caught you know fourteen fifteen pound catfish and sometimes those are good to uh do on a barbecue grill and just leave the skin on and uh do it with uh butter on tin foil and then the skin just basically scrapes right off and uh wer- and it really tastes pretty good There uh Yeah Well I am hoping one of these days I'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on uh a rod and reel but uh so far it's just been uh on the trout lines so Yeah Yeah And uh well up in uh South Dakota in the Missouri River there we've uh tied into a few northern pike and uh they really uh in when the water is cold they are very slow moving fish but in the summer time they'll uh give you a run for your money Uh-huh Yeah In Nebraska Uh yeah Most of the time uh we just fished uh in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in And a lot of them ended up being close to the river so if the river every uh flooded you know then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits and so we would do a lot of fishing there too but uh South Dakota didn't really have much for
