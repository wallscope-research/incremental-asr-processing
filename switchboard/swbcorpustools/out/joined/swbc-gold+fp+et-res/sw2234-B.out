Huh-uh Yeah Did you move from the Northeast Yeah I think yeah People that can really influence the government have all the money to throw No Well yeah I agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get and you know I don't think that there's any system that everybody would think is fair as far as being taxed So I guess in Texas with we live here also and that it's mostly sales tax so really the people that have money to buy things are paying the more because they're paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff I've lived in Texas most of my life We um lived in Kansas City for a couple of years and we were kind of in for a rude awakening They had personal property taxes on like cars and the first year we were there it was kind of like eight hundred dollars And we're like My husband says I used to complain to pay sixty dollars to get licensed in Texas and now you know So I mean that was kind of different and then to file a state income tax was also kind of tough too I guess since we've been married we've moved a lot so it always seems like you know we're always paying taxes for something And it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little money back But I um have a accounting background so I then have also done tax returns in the past for other people when I worked for an accounting firm And uh you know it is kind of sad to see how the people that have the resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put there money in places they don't have to pay taxes Or to buy something that loses money so that they can offset the income that they get or whatever So you know I can understand why the rich people don't want to pay you know a large percent because you know that's not really fair either If they've earned money by themselves well you know people just kind of given the money it's kind of depressing sometimes I think Yeah Well yeah that's true Yeah Yeah Yeah They must have enough other stuff because the way the oil has been the last few years that really has not been the industry that is bringing in the money for the taxes I wouldn't think Yeah Huh-uh Don't you have to why people decided to expect certain services Then they don't really think they should pay for them maybe I don't know Yeah Huh-uh Well it was nice talking to you I've never initiated one of these phone calls Do you call in do you get to pick the subject or Oh I see Yeah Okay you too Bye-bye
