Uh I think uh actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have uh working for a large corporation And for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit I think it's health care It's what I think everybody would say that Right belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you Uh the uh sometimes I think it's more important than salary Yes And uh I don't know if I would rank that second but uh since I have three boys uh it can turn out to be important Yeah you know in a given year dental expenses can really kill you Right Right It's uh Right uh and then uh uh if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodony will Uh I guess that would be up there Uh I'm not sure uh how I would rank that say compared to retirement or uh uh uh pretax savings was another thing that I think is a great benefit And I think it's really something that uh the government ought to encourage more because uh there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in uh Germany and Japan Uh Right when you have uh the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has you can uh offer some incentive and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up uh the savings that you wouldn't otherwise do and Leave You know I don't think so yet They may have uh just plain parental leave which either one can take Uh uh I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short Uh uh uh I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks Right and uh There There ought to be uh uh some compromise where the person would be guaranteed a uh career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh in exchange for a longer period of time uh it's so important to families then uh and yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up Uh That Yeah you're right I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I would most like to see uh changed Uh the uh parental leave Right Right They do it by shortchanging their kids There's no other way I mean uh unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely Uh people moving as much And uh it's just a terrible choice you shouldn't have to make it Uh you're right And uh Oh right Boy would I like to have that Yeah Oh listen I have friends in a lot of different cities If you just fly me there I'll take care of that Right and uh I guess the
