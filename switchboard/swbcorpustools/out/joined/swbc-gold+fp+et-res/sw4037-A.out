Uh Greg uh I'm not familiar I think uh you guys in Indiana don't you have the death penalty Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh I tend to agree with you uh I've changed my views uh even within the last few years uh to be honest Uh uh when I was an undergraduate I was a member of Amnesty International uh and of course at that time you know I thought uh uh it was stupid to kill anybody for uh you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument But the uh the more now I live in downtown Dallas and uh I've seen cases in the news and all where you know uh a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder/ I think that maybe uh a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder Yeah uh Yeah it seems sensible and failsafe uh I don't you know not completely failsafe but if a man's convicted of two murders uh you know there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong Uh I also uh to tell you how liberal I have turned uh toward this or whatever side that is I've kind of chosen uh I believe it that uh big time drug importers like uh say Noriega for example that these people need to be uh eliminated uh from society and I think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh create another power structure Uh-huh Right Right Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Well uh do you uh are there cases where you think that uh the capital punishment shouldn't be uh uh sentenced Uh-huh Right That's true yeah Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Sure yeah I understand your point Yeah Uh of course you know with Dahlmer now uh you realize that I think it's Ohio uh gets to try him next and they do have the death penalty Yeah so uh that was a curious case I Uh uh something is sort of nightmarish to say the least Uh well here in Texas we uh I think even this last week they had another they uh you know they use their capital punishment by lethal injection uh uh
