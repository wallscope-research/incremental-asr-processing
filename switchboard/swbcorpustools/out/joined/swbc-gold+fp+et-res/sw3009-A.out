Okay No I don't but I have nine younger brothers and sisters Uh-huh Uh-huh I would assume you know if you were looking for a day-care center or something like that Or probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing Yes I would think someone older and I would want to know if they've had any past experience with children <> Uh-huh Yes that's true also Uh-huh Uh-huh Well um I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was younger I'm twenty-two now and I did most of my baby-sitting when I was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen But um the only thing people ever asked me well of course they knew I came from a family with younger kids but they really didn't ask me if I was used to children or not The only other thing they asked me is what I would expect in pay You know and um I was pretty surprised because if I had a child and someone you know I personally would ask for people that that person has baby-sit for before Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes Well see my first baby-sitting job was pretty strange Um this lady saw us at church and you know she was a younger lady She didn't really know my mom She knew my mom by name and that was it And um she knew that I was one of the oldest girls in my family so she just asked my mom if I could baby-sit You know she really didn't know my name or anything you know I thought that was pretty strange You know and she had two children One was still in diapers when I started baby-sitting So um she pretty much you know just assumed that I would know you know how to handle them So you know I enjoy kids and I get along with them very well so there's no problem But uh with today's world and the kids today uh I can't say that I would just ask someone you know that I didn't know like that to baby-sit Uh-huh that's true Uh-huh Oh I would be too Oh my Huh-uh Uh-huh yes Uh-huh Oh I know Um well obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well How did you stumble upon the day-care center Did you just look it up in a phone book or what was it Uh-huh Yeah I would say most people would probably go by word of mouth Uh-huh Yes exactly Uh-huh Uh-huh Then again did um money come into play with it at all Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes
