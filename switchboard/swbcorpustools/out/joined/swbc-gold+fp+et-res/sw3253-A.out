Hi I'm wondering what camping means to you Oh very good That's sort of the same thing that I do I don't think of um trailers and campers and all this stuff Um do you do much camping Oh you've never been camping Oh gee Well um yes and no and the uh I haven't done much recently but um up until gee maybe five or six years ago I did a lot of it and you know I've Say No um I used to live abroad and so I camped a lot in um the Middle East and I was able to camp right in ruins which was always very exciting and a bit exotic for those who love bugs um and then when I used to come back to the states in summer we'd often go up um to the lake country in New York with my brother's family and do camping there And you're not going Oh that's too bad Oh gee I guess it makes a difference I grew up camping being in Girl Scouts and things like that so Uh-huh uh-huh Oh that's too bad I think you know there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like but maybe not you know the Canada men's trip but some other you know a nice tent on the shore of a lake and Right the no telephone the gee whiz you go to bed when it gets dark and you get up when it gets light Yeah and um I guess just the change from the rat race No uh it's pretty isolated um and to me I like that I guess too although there are people I mean you know it's really hard to get away and I guess when we did sites in the Middle East of course it was with a group in order to make it safe but I mean we'd go in different parts of the ruins and things like that But we didn't even have tents there we just sort of put out the sleeping roll Right Right Actually I just joined um the Appalachian Trail Walking Club or whatever they call it what uh and I'm very eager to start uh I love to walk and um I'm going to start with day trips though because I don't know the territory and all and I'm not sure my son is not eager to go and you know I think that that might be a little eerie at first going alone Oh but you know I'm going to try Well gee whiz I hope you get into camping some day just slowly Oh yeah Right I think that you know I guess one time recently we went up to Maine and had planned to camp and you know the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field and I said Gee whiz for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a motel which we did and so that you know if the setting was right and it's great but if it's
