Uh I guess my personal opinion I don't mind paying taxes necessarily I just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way Uh sometimes when I hear even what the politicians are making you know when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that uh I think that's just a bit too much to be paying them uh and that's all tax money When you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much it's just billions of dollars that's I think is just being thrown away Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah Well I know any time there's a big uh budget cut you know I work with the state and any time there is a budget cut or crunches it's always the small guy that gets hurt It's never uh the person that's making a hundred thousand there It's always the person that's making the least amount uh and sometimes we're running around there I see these uh supervisors running around uh having meetings I really don't know what they do I sometimes wonder are they really doing anything or Yeah Yeah Well they got so many hidden taxes that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store something like that and you're paying a little tax here and you so Gas I don't know about you guys but there's probably at least about twenty-five to thirty cents of different taxes on our gas And you don't realize Yeah Yeah Well I know like with Reagan they say no new taxes but they changed the uh deductions on you and that just raises your taxes you know they just get it a different way so I mean to me it did uh raise my taxes Yeah I heard someone say that uh if they would just something about with uh the defense budget all that extra money they're throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about six hundred dollars on an average six hundred dollars
