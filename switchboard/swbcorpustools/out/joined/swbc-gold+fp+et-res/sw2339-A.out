Okay I was thinking about camping and people's ideas about it We've even seen people with these campers and they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their T V when they're going That's not Yeah A satellite dish Oh golly That's not the kind we do Do you go camping Well so do we In fact when we first got married we would try to take these trips to Minnesota to see his family and we didn't have a tent or any camping supplies so we'd sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks I mean I know it's dangerous I wouldn't do it now but we did And one time we went to Yellowstone and we were doing the same thing We couldn't find a place to camp and so we were on top of a picnic table with our sleeping bags I guess And this ranger comes up with this light shines it on us and said that we're just bear bait out there We had our food you know and told us to get inside our car Bear bait Yeah Yeah We've got some land at Holly Lake outside of Tyler And we go up there fairly often Sometimes we get a lot of people together to do it And we've done things like when it's kind of cold We take extension cords and we've all got heaters in our tents And in the Summer Same thing we get our extension cords running from all these tents but we've got the fans going So we're not roughing it too much And we have taken T Vs out there for the kids And they've got their electrical hookups So it's not so bad I think the longest we've stayed out there is like five days And they had a library at one time out there So that's really not roughing it so much but we have gone on trips where we bathed in streams That's kind of different And a pool to go to That would be nice <> Uh-huh <> Well my husband has even camped at Lake Lavon with one of his friends he just decided to take the kids out there I mean it's not very many miles from our house at all But they had the time of their lives you know Had the boat just pulled up right by the tents It wasn't bad Yeah And we've taken our tents though loaded them up in car carrier and decided we were going to tent most of the way And it ended up when it came time for us to pull in for the night we'd take a vote And most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel Instead of getting out all that stuff you know Yeah Then you have to get up the next day and move it on Huh-uh But we're set now We've got cook stoves and we've got our bug light and everybody's got their sleeping bags we got air mattresses We decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable Yeah Those double ones Pretty good We're on our third one I think Somehow We've got an electric pump that hooks into the cigarette lighter I didn't know you could do that Yeah No joke I hope you didn't have a big vacuum cleaner Yeah Now we've used a hair dryer before But I put it on hot and also melted it I found that you don't do that I didn't realize it would melt so easily I don't know Yeah I don't like it when there's mosquitos so bad And then one night we were camping and it came just a torrential downpour We had the steaks on the grill These people were with us And I mean everything was sopping wet inside the tent It was just that bad you know And we decided we'd just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything So I got a condo with a jacuzzi and it was wonderful Yeah Yeah it was It's horrible You mean that you put on a truck or what Oh yeah yeah <> Uh-huh <> How many weeks have you been doing these calls I think this must be into my third week too So do you work for T I In a Speech Lab And what exactly are they going to do So any voice no matter what the <> speech pattern or the dialect or anything Um I wonder if these are going to be speaking <> The computers Oh that's kind of neat Do you put all the uh-huhs in here on everything too What do you write for stutter That uh Uh-huh I guess so unless you want to talk about stakes What size stakes to put in / You need metal instead of plastic And you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time We got one of those kind that have got the oh what is it They're plastic and they've got the elastic on the inside of the poles and you just put them together And it's a dome tent That's good isn't it Yeah Um no I've done it in a shelter It was in Padre Island and in a truck off Corpus but not in a tent Oh well that's about all Okay Uh-huh Bye
