Okay Tell me about your home Huh-uh That's pretty tough What area do you live in Oh okay I see Is that pretty typical for your area Yeah Huh-uh That sounds real interesting I live in a suburb of Dallas and uh I live in the basic three bedroom two bath home So at least I have two bathrooms That's not so bad but uh it's pretty typical for the area as well Uh I've always been interested in older homes personally So I think you can end up doing more with them it seems like What about yard space Do you have a big lot or anything like that Oh I see Huh-uh Oh that's nice Because I have just like you know those basic tract houses like that We have a very small yard and um I do have garden but it's extremely small but uh it seems like though for your area that is sort of different In a big city like that most houses I would think would be sort of like what we live in Just a you know basic tract house Yeah That's exactly right That's the way we are uh one thing we have that we really enjoy here is we have a hot tub in the back So we have quite a few parties and uh seems like everyone that lives around us ends up you know hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone So uh that's true that is one thing that I don't enjoy about it is the houses are too close together But uh you know it's fine for now hopefully eventually we'll move in a larger home The only thing that I don't like also is the rooms are so small You know it's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that so Are your rooms in your house bigger since it's a sixties home Because it seems like then that they built the homes much larger is that true Yeah Yeah Yeah That's really it That's a plus At least we do have like three walk-in closets here So that's maybe not so typical but uh Yeah It really does except when you have to fill them up and then you get those Visa bills in And So anyway um anything else about um you know can you compare yourself to any thing around there Yeah So it's Yeah Yeah That's nice That is nice But you know too the only bad thing too is that then you have to keep up you know you have to the yard to deal with and Do you You must have more time than I have I'm sitting out here right now We had this terrible rain and I'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten and it seems like now that's I almost wish I was in an apartment or something You know Yeah Well um I don't know do we just terminate this or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time Do you know Okay Okay Well can you tell me anything else about the house Are you working on it I mean do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation Yeah that's nice Yeah the town that I came from uh is a uh older town it like the typical homes there are like you know early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds and I renovated a house there and that was so much fun I mean there if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy-five to hundred years old you know you're just nobody practically And that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline and uh was considered typical for that area So uh it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that's just you know a very square little box and you know there's not a whole lot you can do with it But uh anyway Yeah That's true Oh really Well I have lived in a small town for you know this town was like less than ten thousand people and it was about sixty miles south of Dallas And you know I didn't move out of there until I was you know twenty-seven and that was just you know so I love the big city You know I had lived in a rural area for so long so I've enjoyed it but uh it can get kind of tough Its like a rat race sometimes Yeah Yeah Yeah It sounds like you enjoy working outside as well I yeah I really do enjoy that But I haven't planted anything yet or you know I usually have gotten flowers coming out the gazoo but I haven't done that yet I've had finals this week So uh you know I'm just kind of trying to stick in with that but uh since that's over with now maybe I can get this yard in shape Do you do a lot of gardening Yeah Yeah Yeah I never have much luck with tomatoes I do plant a lot of beans because it seems like the uh bugs get on them so easily and I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that so the only thing that I use is soap I water you know spray the plants because they say supposedly that will keep the bugs off them But uh I don't have luck with that tomato plant so I hate to spray them with anything Um what do you do Do you have any tips you could give me Yeah Yeah That's true That's true My dad is a farmer so I've heard him talk about that forever I guess it works but um you have to really wash your vegetables after that so it won't make you sick Let's see what else do you do to your house Yeah Oh really Do you plan on like adding any rooms or you have enough space you could probably do that Or is it Yeah I would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms that's tough Do you not like have a half bath Yeah Yeah That's rough The house that I used to live in had one bath and a half And that was even just with two people That was a pain That's good Really That could account for a lot of marital problems I think You get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom No That's right It does not make for a happy situation That's true Well do you have any children One child And they enjoy where they're living Oh so he doesn't know right I guess he's a big help out in your garden Right That's right It's healthy why not Yeah No It won't hurt them I was a big dirt eater supposedly when I was a child and I turned out okay so don't worry about it Just let him enjoy himself So you think that you want to move away from the big city uh Yeah So you're just the opposite from me You want to go back to that uh Yeah Yeah So are you from Texas You are So it's not you know that's true Houston in itself is a pretty tough place
