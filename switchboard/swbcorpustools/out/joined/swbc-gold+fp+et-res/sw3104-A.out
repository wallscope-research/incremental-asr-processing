Uh well let's see Five Well any number is nice let me tell you Yeah It's not as fair to the children either I do not think Oh Yeah but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh You can tell How to just entertain themselves Yeah yeah It's a problem for any child and you take one that's used to being uh busy having something to do all the time it makes a big difference uh keeps you busy Yeah Well that's great No our last daughter she did not want to go to school uh but she's married now they built a home just a couple miles from us And Well we did not do it right all the time With our first boy we persuaded him to start here and I do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home uh right now I think the main thing is to look at what they are interested in Uh and take what they are interested in and then then start looking for schools No not necessarily But Mike our oldest boy I think he would have He wanted to go to Embrey Riddle and we talked him into going local here first And he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh He went to aeronautical uh oh just learning to work on engines and that Uh it has to do with airplanes and everything which is what his whole life is And I really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally And he would probably be flying is what he would be doing Uh but right now of course he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut and they build and rebuild non jet engines Uh uh the second one we let her go where she wanted to {F uh } we did not want her to go but she went to Erie to Gannan University Uh or Gannan College I am not sure which it is college I guess Uh she went there two years and it was more expensive and she soon realized you know even though she did not like Clarion she came back and finished at Clarion Because it uh saved her quite a bit of money and she got really the same basic education that she wanted And our other two boys they went to Clarion also And uh did very well there And uh they have all really got really good jobs And uh Uh-huh Uh yeah they kind of had that they just expected to go Daphne never went she always said she would never go to college I always thought she would change her mind you know but she did not And there's nothing wrong with that you know if college is not for everybody But uh it does make a difference in your wage income I think it's what they want out of life because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are they can make you know a much better income Like my kids they are all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state You know that boggles my mind Uh-huh uh-huh Okay did you go to college You did See it makes a difference Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Some place else Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh That's great Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Different life styles yes yes Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right It's quite a bit different See that's the way we are we are more of a rural type of an area and it does make a difference they say you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking Yeah not really Because they say that a lot of times you get more help with a more expensive college And so in the long run if it's really what they want you know they are better off Now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school Uh we did all we could but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go
