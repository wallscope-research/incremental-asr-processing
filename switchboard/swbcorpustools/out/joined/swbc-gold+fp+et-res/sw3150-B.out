So how do you feel about capital punishment Really Oh I'm pretty much for it We'll have some interesting discussion I guess Wrongfully Yeah Yeah Yeah it would never be equal Right Right Yeah Well you know I guess I can see it from several different perspectives but you know when I hear about things like you know what they've been reporting about in Milwaukee you know to me I don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy You know maybe there is I don't know But you know and you know he's never going to be to me a functioning part of society He's already been either paroled or whatever for child molestation I mean I don't know I really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko And you know for the things he's done I don't know I guess it's either you know put him in jail for the rest of his life you know or capital punishment I guess You know an- and- Uh-huh Oh really Right Yeah Well I can underst- I mean you know there there is always that chance but you know I guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever I mean I don't know uh you know but that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be you know you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they won't do that you know for any situation really But uh you know when you find somebody just like that situation I mean it was disgusting when I read about it today and when you find someone like that that you know is guilty he confessed already to killing eleven you know I guess I have a hard time feeling merciful toward him and you know Right Right Right And trying to rehabilitate him too and you know Right exactly And uh you know nobody wants that You know everybody would be just as scared to death you know we've had a real problem here in Texas with uh prison overcrowding and they've been releasing people left and right and you know they've committed murders and rapes and everything else and you know you just think you know where's the justice here I mean you know they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving Oh really Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Right exactly Yeah Well you know that's exactly I mean I'm not saying I think or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case you know especially because there are some cases when you just don't know and I think there's a shadow of a doubt you know like with this guy in in Milwaukee I mean it he pretty much confessed to it I mean they you know just everything I mean cannibalism and everything else uh I really would have a hard time especially if I was on a jury not wanting him to you know be executed Yeah Because I mean that's just awful Right Well I have a hunch that you know the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway Either I mean you know they I don't know from what I hear about jail life is not any way to live But uh I don't know It's just Uh-huh Really Yeah Yeah Yeah That Yeah Well you know especially like repeat offenders it just appalls me that you know they even get a ten year sentence and be out in in two or three or four years You know that's scary because you know I'm not sure I think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're you know going to be committing any more violent acts or not Right And it's really scary I me- you know I don't know what the perfect solution to that is but I know that especially with violent crimes where you know you're nearly a hundred percent convinced that they're guilty and without much repentance or anything else you know then I don't know I guess I just really don't see much use for this guy in Milwaukee you know For instance I mean that's just I could see capital punishment in a case like that And you know for other people too that do things like that But uh when uh my wife and I are both participating in this survey and she picked up the phone and when she heard the topic she said capital punishment so she was uh Yeah well luckily it was for me Because they coordinate the times so it can only be one or the other So she tried to enter her number and it wouldn't work so she said whew it's for you but uh you know I don't know I struggle with it but I really think that in terms of like this I think that it might not be such a bad thing Because I don't know that anybody would feel good you know like if you let someone like that loose in your community You know I'm su- you'd have to be scared to death
