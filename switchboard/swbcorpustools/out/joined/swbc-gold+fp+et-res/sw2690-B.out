Uh it's kind of hard to put my finger on a favorite T V program however uh one that I've been watching for a number of years is DALLAS uh And uh it's going to be going off the air uh let's see a week from tonight It's going to be its last show So I've I've kind of enjoyed watching over the years I've been disappointed in it and also pleased in it And uh I was uh greatly disappointed uh when I did move down to Plano to uh find out that uh the uh great South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house Uh-huh Oh well That's a shame Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh Yeah Well it's it's uh when you look at the uh you know route seventy-five coming down there I mean it's actually a bridge but it's a bridge over top of roadway There's no water there I mean uh Yeah Well there uh well they I think when they open the show up they give you two different views of Dallas One from the east and one from the west And that's why But it kind of confuses people But uh uh I enjoy uh uh a lot of different comedies Um I think it's mainly for an escape um you know uh my job is not the most thrilling in the world and uh I enjoy laughing and uh some of the shows that uh are on the air some are just purely you know brain drainers And then there's other ones that uh deal with uh in a funny manner uh socially relevant things And uh one show that comes to mind is like DESIGNING WOMEN Uh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yes Yes uh it has been very entertaining and also uh the issues they deal with uh really tends to open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems And uh I've really enjoyed that one since it came on Um I don't like the politics surrounding the program though but I mean other than that you know there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses But uh and then uh I've kind of gotten hooked on P B S stuff uh public uh T V Uh I like things like NOVA and uh some of the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff I just enjoy watching that stuff Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well I'm one of those rare guys who I rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event um if ever watch one Uh there's just not that much I'm interested in Um for a while I watched some football but I've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and watch a baseball game Uh-huh Well I think it was great when they were you know like world champs and they were doing real well uh I personally I came from the Washington area And so I was a big Washington Redskins fan And uh when I came down to Dallas uh you know I found myself rooting for the home team I uh in fact I have uh a baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker the only year they played together on the Dallas Cowboys Oh wow Huh slash error Yeah should be independent slash unit Huh No I haven't seen that Uh-huh Uh-huh uh Gee I'll have to try to catch that sometime It's Yeah that's probably true Yeah we don't either uh I couldn't rationalize paying you know it's like if I pay for a movie channel then I have watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them And you know if I didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic well I can get that for free And well I really don't need C N N I see enough bad news all the time I don't need to see more of it So I've kind of uh rationalized that it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see And of course when we were living in Texas it was real convenient with Tom Thumb You know having movies uh back then it was ninety-nine cents I mean go Yeah Um You can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like H B O or Cinemax Uh-huh Oh yes I do too Yeah And uh I've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty and uh you know she just doesn't like them And um she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie And I've told her you know everybody I know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick And uh so I'm hoping I can get her talked into it soon Um Um That's great Yeah But as far as uh regular T V shows I mean I've got some shows that I would be afraid to admit to you that I've actually sat down and watched And then there's others that uh uh I wish I had time to see It's like I enjoy watching CHEERS It's very funny Some of the things in it are mindless but I just don't have time to watch it Um I think about the only night that I really sit in front of the T V set all night long probably is on Monday night Because um I work so hard over the weekend doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday Monday night I'm just worn out So I kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and look over things And I can sit in front of the T V set and look at you know go through my mail and watch T V at the same time Uh-huh
