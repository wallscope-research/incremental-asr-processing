Okay so um yes uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago we have a computer here at the house and I made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month and then basically since then what I've done is keep track of it through the checkbook so that based on the check coming in then how much I'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also spe- because our house payment is once a month that's our biggest uh expense so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook with each paycheck even thought it's really still there so that I can keep uh uh good balance a running total yeah through the month What do you all do is it hard to keep track of it or does it work out pretty well and you're staying within your budget and everything is working pretty good You don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that That's a good choice we're trying to uh do that this year We've budgeted the money that we were spending on a CODA account with T I and then money we were also buying stock with for that year we've taken that this year and said we're going to pay off all of our credit cards and uh we have uh another loan with the bank and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that we'll be free and clear That's good to be in that kind of shape What are you all trying to do long term Uh-huh Yeah mostly what we've done the uh CODA account with T I where we put in so much a month or so much a pay check and then they match it So that's worked out pretty good and then I used to work for T I and I have when I retired from there or left I took the money that I had in mine and put it in an I R A and we had an existing I R A so both of us have some money in an I R A that we're also trying to figure we're putting it in C D's right now and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund Yeah The other thing that we've done that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies um uh John Hancock company came out and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and uh what our uh goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house um special thing buying land and building our own house and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at and then gave us you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals or not and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time Yeah that's the other financial thing I guess that we've done is with our life insurance is since I'm at home now is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me that's a big thing to think about Okay I guess that's most of my um financial plans right now is there anything you'd like to add Well it's been nice talking to you Bye bye
