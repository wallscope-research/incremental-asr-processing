Not really I'm not much of a fan of Nancy Reagan so I don't particularly read um biographies or autobiographies I haven't read too many I'm more of a fiction and nonfiction reader not of that nature though Yeah if they had it I don't even know that I'd probably read it even if it was at the library though you know I'm just not really interested in reading about other people's lives to that degree You know unless maybe they lived a long long time ago For me it would be interesting to find out what life was uh like you know in that period But not really interested Yeah I think the last biography that I read I think it was um on Lady Randolph Churchill Churchill's mother And that was excellent Um yeah It was it's in two parts I think the first one is called JENNY or something like that uh because that was her name And um I only got to read one part of it And I've been looking for you know the other half of it and read the I read that half where she was in her later years and it was absolutely excellent And it was very descriptive of people with money back then and uh affluents in England uh that you know were associated to the king and all And it was really pretty fascinating and that was actually a couple of years ago so it's been a while since I've read any biographies Uh I love to read I mean I'm constantly reading I like uh mysteries and I like um as far as improving myself uh I haven't read any lately But I was reading classical works that I hadn't read before You know that you might have needed to read in school but that I just didn't read for some reason or another or you know that you can only read so many in school that they make a requirement of And you have so many out there uh that you know you never get a chance to read And so I said well I think it was because I read um Dickens' A TALE OF TWO CITIES and um that even when I read it now it still makes me cry the ending of it And I could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book I'd read some Dickens before but I hadn't read that one And I thought to myself you know what other things are out there that are classics you know that have withstood time and that are just excellent something's excellent about them whether it's the way they were written or whether it was the material you know that was written about um so I started reading you know I had a binge of bo- my mother uh I was living in Bermuda at the time with my husband but my uh mother sent me you know like you know uh boxes full of different books And uh she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over But she was I guess because it seems like uh older people have much better uh in their schooling they got more of the classics than I did you know And she knows so much more of them than I do I wouldn't even know you know to go look for that author or that book You know probably you read a book review or something A review on it Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Well what I do is I usually have two books at one time I have a classic which I have to work on basically you know uh just depending well some authors I can just you know basically drink in but others eh I really do have to work at them And then um whether you know they're a foreign author or whatever um or if it's their style or just understanding the material And then some of those it's like I said it's like school you have to work at it But to me it's worthwhile in the end I feel good about it and I usually remember those a long time later And then I have books that I read just purely for enjoyment you know I mean yeah just light reading that are I particularly like Dick Francis books and just some of the authors that are uh for mysteries you know just uh purely for entertainment you know That's it I'm not really expecting to get anything out of it except to be momentarily pleased you know because I can never remember the plots or anything later on those books Yeah Yeah television it gives you everything So it's basically mindless I mean the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you you know what you're hearing and uh your sight But they give you everything else And the television that we see nowadays seems like it doesn't even have some of the underlying uh things to it you know that maybe the old movies and things had you know the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out Or you know like with Hitchcock or something where you're either expecting something or w- I don't know I don't really care much for T V at all I just I mean I sometimes get hooked into it but I really get mad at myself when I do because I realize fully there's no really redeeming value for T V No Yeah You're developing your imagination You know when you develop your imagination that can take you into a lot of other areas because you've developed uh your mind in seeing things you know even if it's your own set way you know you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind So I mean it's excellent we haven't got children yet but I hope to uh set an example for ours you know that reading it can be your best friend basically I mean even if you haven't got a human friend around you can pick up a book and be with somebody basically It sounds like your kids are doing stuff Or are you a teacher I gathered you might be a teacher Oh Uh-huh Yeah Okay Okay You too Take care Bye-bye
