Yes what major changes have affected your life You mean yourself or women in general Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh That's interesting because that relates to the thing that strikes me the most and I'm sure you've labelled the cause because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave And That's right that's right And you know I mean I was thinking it just you know my complaint would be um that I think that you know the kids in the neighborhood run wild and they destroy property and they you know steal each other's toys and stuff and there's just no respect for people or property and I guess you know when you stop to think of it these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives Scary Uh-huh But for how many years Uh-huh Oh that's great Uh-huh Right Uh-huh No I agree a hundred percent a hundred percent I guess I was lucky because I was teaching and so I was able to just go to a class and teach when my son was little and so I'd be gone you know an hour and fifteen minutes or something at a stretch And then yeah very soon he was old enough to just go and sort of stay in my office and you know nobody seemed to have a big problem with that So That's an interesting issue though Um yeah Right I've actually a question I would have is I guess I'm being you know beyond the age of thinking of this problem I had an argument recently with my boss I think it was about the need for women to work But I think you put your finger on it when you said that they're not respected if they don't work because it seems to me that a lot of people I know women I know are doing very menial jobs in a certain sense certainly financially and I mean when I see the amount of clothes that they buy and how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home I'm sure that they're not quote making money for the family on this and probably you're right Well no even families that don't have child care I mean you know when I think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year I'm sure she spends at least that in clothes plus you know fast food every day and out to lunch every day and Exactly and I mean you know even though they don't have children they have relatives and you know the husband would certainly like a lot more attention and she wouldn't have to hire somebody to clean the house and do the gardening And so I guess you're right it's our society demands women to work if they're going to be respected Really sad Oh that's true Uh-huh Uh-huh so that might be a positive change in society Uh-huh uh-huh I guess I haven't seen that as much in this area although every now and then you hear about it Uh but among you know people I know I don't see a great you know there are those people who have had serious questions all along and you know are sort of pursuing it but um the churches here are growing leaps and bounds and I thought it was more because of the very transient nature of the area and that people were going basically just as you said as a social to meet people and that but um it's hard to judge and there are a lot of things changing I suppose Just you know the whole environment I find um sort of you know I wonder with all our chemicals and that and the foods we eat and you know young people that I know are getting very serious diseases and Probably Well it's just maybe it's more unusual now when you know somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer and in the past maybe the same percentage got them but we didn't know it or I don't know Well I guess we've sort of run dry a little bit It was nice talking to you Okay Bye-bye
