Just recently I was kind of laughing when I heard the switchboard talking about the question because uh I had to have my uh radiator flushed and it was getting rusty And the thing that they forgot to do was um to also look at the hose and I had gone about oh two days with my new radiator flushed and the hose burst So I was stranded out on the highway No I didn't do that thank goodness but uh there seemed to be enough antifreeze you know left to do that but it cost me all kind of money you know to have that repaired after they said they were going to they had repaired it So that was a horrible experience just recently Yes yes I know I know What about you Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh oh Especially when you're out on the highway Uh-huh Uh-huh I know well you know uh living in Dallas you know we've got uh bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic and uh that was horrible You know to have the you know your car is fuming and everything It's already a hundred degrees you don't need that too Oh shoot But my car is getting old See it's about six years old now so Yeah so I got it right out of college and so uh it's starting to show the wear and tear now Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah uh that was my graduation present to myself so Yeah Yeah I know but gosh it's really starting to wear so I've been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car Go- because uh I don't know if I want to you know pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah that's true I agree with you there So I don't know uh because I need to have it you know tuned up and I don't know replace some of the belts And I was looking at the uh tires need to be replaced and so I was thinking just a lot of money I'm might as well buy me a new car for that Uh-huh Well you have to in Pennsylvania boy you have to really have your car winterized and stuff huh Uh-huh Oh really Oh okay So Uh-huh Well especially don't you have what a lot of salt on the ground Uh-huh Yeah Yeah well rust and the body too huh Uh-huh Well I think they get the new Z-bart stuff and everything to where you can um Uh-huh Yeah and go like that so Do you Uh-huh uh-huh Well I think I'm getting too old for all that I had four brothers and they used to drag me out underneath the car and stuff so I can do all that stuff but I think I'd much prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to go have it done now so I can get my hands dirty So yeah I'm just getting to that age I guess You just don't have your time becomes very precious so working on the car is just not one of those things I want to spend my time on anymore Absolutely absolutely So yeah I'm trying to you know I just need one I had two cars there for a while so I wouldn't have to worry about which car was going to run And yeah but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them And yeah so that Yes one was bad enough But I think I got rid of the wrong one I need a lot of repairs done on this one so yeah uh that was something else <> Well are our five minutes up I didn't set the time or anything to uh Yeah put Well yeah I guess Um you know unless you're um you know big do-it-yourselfer Um to you know fix up your own cars and things like that but I guess they were talking about experiences You know uh uh I did my parents live in Ohio so I do know something about you know the really cold weather And uh I've always lived down here in the south and oh I took my car up there to their house and um I guess I had a crack in the block and when I got up there the car
