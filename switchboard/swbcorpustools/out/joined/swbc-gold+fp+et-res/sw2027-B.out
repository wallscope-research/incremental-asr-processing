Well I'm kind of that way too I work in the legal department and where we are now what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day it always seems like I'm doing that and I can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry you know boxes of documents around so if I'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents I dress down But if we're going to have a meeting where we're having the attorneys come in or uh other party's attorneys and stuff then I normally dress up Yeah and I'll wear a dress and hose and stuff Uh-huh Uh-huh That's right that's right As a matter of fact I thought I had one funny story when uh I was at T I the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes We had them in the warehouse and at that point the warehouse was over across the road and it wasn't air conditioned and we were there like in the middle of the summer it's unair-conditioned it was dusty and dirty uh there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it And so we didn't really know we weren't supposed to we thought T I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job we wore shorts We didn't know that was a big no no And the supervisor from another area came up to us and you know this area where record retention is there's only a few people that work there and he knew who worked there he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there And he came up to us and he just said who's your supervisor Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor's supervisor and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts He didn't at least say to us did you know you're not supposed to do that That could have alleviated a big problem We ended up getting called out on it Yeah Uh-huh Um Um Yeah Um Well I've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine And they have said no Yeah I didn't know that E D S has a very strict dress code I had a friend Oh definitely I had a friend who worked there for a year or so and they spell it out For men it's particular suits uh the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and wing tipped shoes Oh it is definitely lined out Women are not allowed to wear slacks you wear coordinated suits and a particular kind of shoe you know so high heel oh it is spelled out When I was looking at her materials when she first started you know she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff And it told about the dress code and it said these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and hair just this way Yeah and E D S is very particular about this hair cuts I mean it was like you can't have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just really detailed Well the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had uh another person coming from Washington our outside counsel And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse And she came with skirts just like she'd be going into the office And we'd try to say didn't you bring any pants or anything we're out here in the warehouse you know you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes and you're going to have unload you skid look at the documents in the boxes and then repack your skid she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt She finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants but you know I mean it was just completely miserable for her Some of our people in the legal department we have um assistants to the general counsel and it's funny because there's one that always wears a suit A matter of fact he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned And then there's another one who's a little younger and a little more yuppish and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt and sometimes he wears the jacket to it And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt So that's just With you know the little suspenders or something on so we've kind of had a variety there but I think a lot of times it's mainly who they're going to meet with or they're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are If there just going to be meeting with T Iers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and they're engineers that they're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and they're usually casual Yeah It's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here Yeah this is kind of a fun project I've done some of the other speech programs but we've never got to talk to another person it was always just talking to the computer So this is a little different Yeah Okay bye
