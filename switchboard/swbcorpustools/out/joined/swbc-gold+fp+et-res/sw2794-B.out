Damned if I know Um I don't know I suspect uh let's see I suspect we should do what everyone says we should do we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes but Lord knows one shouldn't say that I suspect we should probably have an independent auditing agency go in and look at how the government spends money And work from there because I don't think they're very good at it <> Huh <> Yes Yeah well why do you say that actually <> Huh Yes Rather than using taxes Oh that's interesting Yeah that's probably true I mean well we'd be spending less because all the money that normally goes to support those people aren't working it's back in the system So you're right That's a real neat idea Well what but I mean what can you know at some point what can you do I mean to raise jobs I wonder Oh okay So start But that's not going to work uh Huh And that way just create more jobs <> or whatever <> Huh <> well that's a neat idea Yeah that's what you think space would do that much for that or Like what Oh you think that would uh have a major effect Well that would put a lot of criminals out of business for a while anyway that might have uh a good effect on crime anyway That's probably true And probably a lot of Yeah but that's potentially <> Uh-huh huh No I had never thought about that Uh-huh That's true often times they are paid more yeah Right That's just what on their part I'm sorry I missed that Oh Uh-huh that maybe true That's very true Right <> Right that's a <> Huh Yeah and along the same lines maybe reduce imports as well I think I mean We don't need to buy other people's stuff right now new slash unit after the first period Right well that's what happened in other country though And other places they tax us quite ha- I mean they tax American imports quite heavily So we could do the same thing I mean just and you know they may get Right it does seem only fair I mean why not I think so Yes Oh real Oh really I love the switch Well at that point it wouldn't be a problem anymore possibly you know we would be able to keep it wherever we wanted to in space or the ocean research whatever we wanted to do but I think the Right Uh-huh Right compared to defense Well that's a good idea Well it well and the other thing I think we seriously need to do is um like I say have someone go in and look you know and find out where it is we're paying ten thousand dollars per toilet seat or something Um greed I suspect <> Uh-huh Yeah Really For making you mean government issue underwear Jesus Uh-huh Well that's potentially a fault of the government then I mean that things like that should Right well that's a I had never heard that before Right <> Huh Oh okay so you know about some of these things
