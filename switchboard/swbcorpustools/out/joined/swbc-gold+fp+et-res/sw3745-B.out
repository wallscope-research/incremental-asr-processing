All right Well what do you think Oh Well tell me about it what are the problems with public education Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Right Do you find that those parents um I've seen the same thing and heard the same things and at the same time I've heard that it's even harder when both parents are required to work and can't spend you know that time you know typically the mother was at home with uh the children and at least could kind of keep up on what's going on and really society sort of dictates that uh you know both the parents work And um I know I've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the you know the second and third grade uh if the kids had you know proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that would make a lot of difference Yeah Well I work at a university and it's really tough when we're uh uh I uh work at the University of Texas at Dallas and uh we have uh some pretty selective admissions requirements for incoming freshmen And you know there are some students who are you know in the top ten of their class and their S A T scores are very low and a lot of it has to do with uh their reading ability you know their language and It uh makes it tough because you know when they come in with scores that low they may be uh good students but they just haven't achieved to their fullest potential and they're going to fail unless some sort of remedial uh education is given to them And then then it comes into well who's supposed to give it to them the colleges and universities or are they supposed to get that back in the high schools and the junior highs Yeah Yeah it sounds like it So how many children do you have at home Oh Yeah Well that's good
