Can you speak up please Yes Uh But they will accept you later in life also Yeah after your children are grown Yes No No I'm not Some of the people that have been involved with Peace Corps among other things were retired teachers Uh there was a retired plumber that went to uh uh Uruguay I think and helped them quite a bit with concepts in plumbing you know providing for better public hygiene Yeah but so do you think that people should be required to give a couple years for the good of the country Why Well I understand but if it were told to us that we would find the time somewhere between our seventeenth and uh twenty-sixth birthday to give a year or two to the to the country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or the Peace Corps or you know the military service or something Wouldn't we have uh maybe a better class of Americans a lot of our uh pardon the terminology but yuppies now are interested in one thing and one thing only and that's themselves And at least if you legislated giving for a couple years of their lives or uh honestly purely giving but some sort of equitable exchange then at least the country would have gotten two years from them where um they would have given something to the country instead of taking away all their lives Uh give them your entire life for two years no I think this really should be 2 slash units with the respective labels  It will be a job of sorts I'm sure that the Peace Corps doesn't pay well it's not top wages but it does pay The military for young hiring in soldiers does pay it doesn't pay well Okay currently in our country especially in some regions there's an employment problem You're aware of that I'm sure And Texas Instruments You know in another time we had the W P A Works Progress Administration during the great depression though I can't see why it was great Uh that gave people pay that was halfway between relief which was welfare and the minimum wage In trade for money and living They gave them food and uniforms and uh here in Colorado you'll find a great many things Public roads that were worked on by the W P A uh dams that were built by the W P A uh scenic overlooks parks our road system's falling apart our national road system of highways and roads is falling apart there's a lot of work to be done I can't see the problem in it for a year Th- what I'm saying is that if it were mandatory that every person right after graduation from high school that were able-bodied would well or not give a year but trade a year then they at least one not more than say three or four then it would definitely effect unemployment I don't know Well you know Texas New Mexico Colorado huge numbers of other western states have no real welfare system There's Aid to Dependent Children and Aid to Mothers of Dependent Children but there's no real welfare system But if we took these people off the streets for a year there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation for everyone else And who knows maybe some of our graduating high school seniors would find out a little bit more of what the traditional American work ethic means You know we have had some problem with that in recent years Uh they wish only for the paycheck Really producing Yeah be it selling drugs or whatever Yeah yeah And maybe if we instilled the work ethic you know I enjoy working
