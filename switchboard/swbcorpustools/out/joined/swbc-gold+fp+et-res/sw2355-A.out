Okay um what do you think about the war recently Uh-huh Uh the economy the our soldiers going over uh just everything Yeah yeah Yeah that's the first thing I thought of I don't know Right <> Right Right and I know that uh I've heard people say that you know when people that went to World War Two you couldn't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war but then in Vietnam that was totally different you know you couldn't be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably And now if you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a good candidate exactly Oh torn apart Oh yea- Uh-huh Right So it that's also a good reason why it or good that it ended as soon as it did Uh-huh Exactly and it seems like everything is raising everything that can be cigarettes not that I smoke but cigarettes um uh stamps I mean it seems like ever- Exactly everything single thing that we do is higher you know And they just raised the minimum wage today but that's not like you know as much as they should have raised it I'm sure But uh Right Right Right Yeah I don't have any children or anything right now uh I work as a news reporter in Waco and so I get to see I got to see uh probably a good part of the war um as far as what people thought about it and a lot of things like that so It was kind of amazing people were coming to me to ask me you know what's going on you know like I knew or like I sat in on the meetings or something Yeah yeah So I got to hear a lot of what the people thought about you know changes in the war and everything so that was pretty interesting Yeah Exactly be everything be supermom exactly Uh-huh Right And Whereas it would have been Exactly um Right The roles are changing a lot Right And even you know I think a lot of the movies we see now kind of play a good part in our changes because you see that they have THE THREE MEN AND A BABY type movies And I think you know that yeah and then you have the women uh detectives now and you know different roles just in what we see so we probably want to do that even more now You know since the women's movement in the seventies and you know we've come a long way but I think it's still have a good ways to go So Uh-huh Right Yeah Exactly Exactly It's just not as Exactly But it's I mean like I say we've come a long way but we have I mean twice as far to go still and I don't think a lot of people you know realize the plight of a lot of people You know and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you but there's so many more people exactly  that you don't even + slash marks right Should there be one after 'exactly' that you don't even  see or know about Oh oh yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah <> Yeah I grew up in Brooklyn New York and so I was just surrounded you know by Black people because I'm Black and so you know that's where I lived so now I feel lucky actually because I've almost lived around everyone I went to U T to college and so you know they have a lot of different people go there different kinds of people And so I feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see you know some people have lived in Lewisville all their life you know and they don't get to see Exactly And th- Uh-huh Uh-huh Exactly It is Oh my God Well there's so many people who have never you know even gotten to do that so that's great My sister was telling me she's going to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and uh she just met a girl from um I think Barbados or Jamaica or something like that And I mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time and everything and she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars So my sister had to take her shopping and you know show her what to wear show her how to match up colors and I just thought that was so very exciting you know to go and just witness you know this girl just coming to America type thing you know So you know I would have loved the opportunity to do that but Oh yeah Uh-huh the latest cereal about you know th- Yeah that's ridiculous too When I first moved here I was only thirteen but everyone had a car in school you know and I just couldn't belie- you know I was from New York so you know we road the bus And if you had a ca- Yeah Exactly And if you had a car there was nowhere to park it anyway or you know it's just you just didn't have a car but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools and I couldn't understand it You know all the kids had cars and they you know have to have a car So that was Yeah yeah right Really Or live really close to school and have them walk But uh yeah a lot of changes So I think so Okay well it's good talking to you Okay Bye-bye
