So well you take this subject much more personally than I do I suppose Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah you weren't supposed to want a job Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job Yeah Did you Uh-huh Oh yeah So it was you and the kid and your work schedule is Well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer You know the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they're going to be there But if you're going to be more professional oriented then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that doesn't really go with the family Uh-huh So you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer Is that what you're saying What will you Oh okay you've found something else Yeah Yeah Yeah I mean you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child Uh-huh and they need that you know to be able to relate to other people besides the same person every day Yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and if it's not mom then dad or somebody's got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah so jobs have to I guess become more flexible Yeah Well so that's another thing that has to adapt is you know the father's attitudes about you know whose job is this Well it's his job too And I to me the only important issue is the children because as far as housework goes you know men can do housework just as easily as women and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesn't take as much time as it used to So uh Yeah conv- yeah just yeah con Yeah well Uh-huh Yeah And you Yeah you talk yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah And a man might say out loud well you know I understand this and I agree but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him and that's a very hard attitude to change Uh-huh Yeah uh-huh yeah Uh-huh And a lot of that is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid Which brings us back to the idea you know someone's got to be there taking care of the kids to you know drill in the right ideas to so that they know that uh you know male and female are both responsible for doing this and uh Uh-huh Yeah Um Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah But I think in between we got a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap And so basically no one was taking the responsibility and I think that's happened in a lot of cases Uh-huh Un you know some time day care is really good but sometimes it's baby-sitting It's someone you know keeping an eye on the kids but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any relationship with the adults to say you know here's what's right and here's what wrong and here's what we expect of you Yeah Uh-huh Yes I'm saying this as I'm trying to keep my nine month old from trashing something Yeah well she's usually in bed by this time but she's staying up late tonight But yeah I want to have a relationship with her You know my dad was a very traditional dad and when I was a child I didn't really know my dad very well and I miss that And I want Yeah but men have to be convinced of that No
