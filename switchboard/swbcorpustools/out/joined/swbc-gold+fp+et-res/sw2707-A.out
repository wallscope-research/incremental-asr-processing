Okay We're official now yeah Oh okay Oh yeah Oh you're not the so-called ex- you need a house I guess to go through all of that I have had a couple of houses and uh the only recommendation I would have for someone who hasn't gardened is uh one get a couple of good books of books of course and usually they have talk shows Here in Dallas they have two great uh talk shows that go through everything that will grow here which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are and so Uh in fact you could easily do that now turn on a talk show up there and see if there's got to be some gardening folks on the radio that says when to put your grass in and what kind of grass to grow up in Virginia and everything so I uh for someone who doesn't garden I'd say that's my biggest recommendation is to Oh yeah yeah I like it a lot uh uh it's a lot of work I'm an engineer I'm with T I You are you with T I up there or Okay Uh where was oh yeah no I like it uh I always know that why I'm not a farmer when I garden though I mean it is dog work and it is tough I have a lot of trees down here uh the part I don't like I guess would be from December through February where you have to rake leaves forever it seems like and the wind blows all the leaves on from your neighbor after you rake yours so other than you know those three months when it's pure dog work uh the rest of it's very enjoyable just going through the experiences of putting little plants in or whatever I haven't had to plant any trees because I've got so many uh uh but I do listen to that talk show there is some great people from Texas A and M I don't know maybe you've heard of A and M down here but there's some great uh folks uh that have been well trained and again uh to uh recommend gardening for this area Yeah you probably have rye grass up there We grow bermuda and Saint Augustine here Right yeah see you would have to learn that though see Um Do you have much luck in the Winter or they're freeze out because the roots are all in the Winter uh or do you have to start all over every year Right yeah Uh-huh In the same pot that's amazing Uh-huh Yeah I grow a few things in pots but we have to bring them in here in the Winter because usually uh if it's not below the ground so you can insulate the roots from freezing you know the pots will die everything in a pot will die so you can bring them well we do bring stuff in the garage and everything but uh it's quite time consuming by the way I don't know how close you are to getting a house or anything but it's quite uh But I would definitely do it I'm all for doing everything whether whatever subject you pick do it the knowledgeable way don't go out there and start digging holes uh Get some books of whether it be Pennsylvania or Virginia as well as not your neighbors of course they usually know nothing but listen to still then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper or communications as well as I bet there's a talk show up there right now that if you turn the dial around you'll on Saturday this is Saturday that you'll find someone probably in the morning I don't know discussing you know what we do up in Virginia to get something growing you probably don't have to do much over there the soil's probably so good our soil's not very good down here We're I guess in the ice age it's pushed a lot of uh limestone and everything to some parts of Dallas you just can dig a foot down and you hit solid limestone you know so uh I think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of like the Johnny Appleseed type trees where people have come from I'm sure the Indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of Dallas it's so scrubby uh and I think that we even got our famous hundred year old pecan trees from Alabama and all that too we call them native pecan trees but they grow wild here they're eating pecans though Pecans are probably not taken from Virginia they're probably only in the South for pecan pie and all that it's what they call pecan pie up there in the East from Pennsylvania and New Jersey I'm from New Jersey originally Yeah I've worked on that with a little chewing gum which I shouldn't do uh Go ahead how many times have you called by the way or how many times have you been called Uh-huh Oh yeah today that's what I'm saying today I got to laugh because I tried it this morning and I thought everybody was gardening I thought Well no no This is a great subject because they're out there gardening you know I didn't tell you what our weather is like It is beautiful here today It's not quite that hot Yeah we've had a real nice mild Spring You might have seen if you've seen the news today about all the tornados here that were north of us Uh I don't know if you get C N N I don't get C N N but it's here at work in fact I'm at work today believe it or not But uh they have T Vs in the break areas and there was some heavy tornados uh I guess in Kansas quite a few people were killed You'll see that on the evening news Uh Tornados uh which is not the right subject but uh they blow through here all in the Spring I guess it's related somewhat to the weather you know and the plants and all that uh sometimes they do essentially nothing and the weather men yesterday were all alert say hey there's something really terrible going to happen and they sure were right but it wasn't in Texas it was north of us Yeah look at the news tonight they claim thirty odd people were killed up in Kansas City Kansas Anyway back on planting Uh It is very interesting uh subject uh when did you get a house uh your trees grow up so well up there but I'm sure you have plenty of trees that is a key thing for shade and keeping your bills down uh I guess you have mostly pine trees but where in Virginia are you all Uh-huh Oh do you have the cherry blossoms in there or not Yeah Oh yeah Yeah azaleas grow all over we grow those here too although again we have to prepare the soil You probably have nice big pine you probably have all kinds of trees the oaks and everything that's one thing I noticed there Uh-huh Have you ever been down here Okay it's interesting country It is wide open uh and flat uh and again as I said I think when the Indians were here there there weren't any trees but the civilization has brought all kinds of experiments with all kinds of trees and a lot of them have done well uh they do have some pine forest areas in east Texas where you have native pine trees but here in Dallas I think they all were planted by the classical Johnny Appleseed and Johnny Pecanseed whatever you would call it you know there's a tremendous amount of pecan trees that we use you know uh for eating I think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop uh hundred and fifty years ago because they are all over the place in the South What else I don't have any say I the subjects are usually pretty interesting of course I'm a T Ier so I'm hoping this works T I is very good uh has done a lot of experiments in the uh speech uh synthesis can't say it And they've come out with some new products in fact this week they came out with some new math uh you might see them in your advertisements uh new math uh Speak and Math uh devices they have had Speak and Spell and all that for years but they've come out with some different ones this past week and uh my wife and everyone what are they going to accomplish out of all this and I said Well you're not going to have to type on the computer one day you're just going to have to talk to it you know so you it's going to be much faster of course you know the classical thing for the handicapped too person who can't type very fast or like I can of course not that I can type very fast either but uh Yeah
