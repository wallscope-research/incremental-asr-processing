Okay All right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I work for the University of New Hampshire and uh our benefits package uh isn't quite as good in some ways Uh you know overall I'm satisfied with it We don't have the vision care we do have the health care uh and the or the dental Uh No I'm on the professional administrative and technical staff and effectively I run the telephone switch uh at the University of New Hampshire Uh so uh the benefits uh probably the main thing I like about the benefits is uh the uh very generous vacation time and sick time We get fifteen days a year sick time and uh right from the day one when you start work you get twenty-four days a year uh time off Yeah Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I think uh the health care of course is an important and has to be the single most important benefit and uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh you know I'm a little disturbed about that but I think that's a national trend and uh I don't know what the solution is to it It's bigger than just the benefits part Uh-huh Right Oh yeah Um Uh-huh Um Right Uh-huh Well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending and the cost between them is very little I think it costs me something like five dollars a month for the dental plan But it pays uh a substantial amount I mean the examinations and uh checkups or every six months are free and uh it covers the bulk of the dental expenses Uh yes it is The benefits plan is different for what we call operating staff which are considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which I belong to but the main I think the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan But the main difference is in uh the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued Uh for the operating staff it's it's you know based on how long they've worked there That determines how much uh vacation time they get Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh College programs belong to this T I A A uh C R E F retirement fund Right and in the case of the University of New Hampshire uh
