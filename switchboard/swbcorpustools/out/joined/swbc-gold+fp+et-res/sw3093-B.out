Right Yeah where do you usually go Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Right uh we have not had a vacation in several years so be our first chance in awhile uh we are going to go to uh Destin Florida which is a very nice beach area if you are not familiar with it Oh it's gorgeous Uh we used to go quite a bit uh before I moved out here We were closer and uh used to go almost every summer uh and rent a condo there on the beach Uh uh there's a lot of development of condominiums there on the beach front uh so uh they are very large condos And they have quite a few rooms uh so we will usually rent one for about a week or so And go down Oh Yes uh it's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water and a lot of nice waves usually uh enough to make it I am sorry Uh there's not as many sea shells along there uh that's the only thing that they really do not they have some but not not so much Um if you go further down uh you will usually find some but not right in there Uh I do not know why it is but uh it just it seems not to have as many right there But uh we enjoy it uh it's we usually stay at the same place every year and they are like I say right on the beach So It's a place called Jetty East uh J E T T Y E A S T and it's uh called that because it's at the very end of uh a jetty there which is uh sort of at the end of this little point and uh it's at the very end it's the last set of condominiums there and uh it's very nice Uh it's not very expensive uh you can I think we are going to go with another couple and their kids And uh we have a uh I think it's three bedroom or two bedroom uh condominium which will sleep I do not know quite a few about six or eight And uh cause it's got you know pull out couches and all that and uh I think it's going to cost us per couple about three hundred dollars for the week Yeah it really is because uh uh you know it has got its own full size kitchen and everything And this one I think has two baths and it's the one we got is on the beach side So We have got a beautiful view and balcony and uh just you know it's really a nice stay Uh in fact we stayed there on our honeymoon I had won a trip to the Bahamas but did not get to take it on our honeymoon time so we instead went there uh and loved it just as much as if we had gone to the Bahamas in fact we stayed an extra day or so because we liked uh the particular uh uh uh suite we had gotten was very nice and so we decided to stay But uh it's a pretty nice place you will need to try to go and stay there sometime It's a little far from here but uh Yeah we are We are it will take uh a day and a half to get there probably So Uh-huh Uh what does that mean alternate Oh Uh-huh Right I see Kind of scattering the vacation throughout the year Yeah Right Right Okay Okay So long Bye-bye
