Okay what do you think about it Oh yeah Uh-huh yeah I do too I think it's going to like in the future I think all women are going to work I mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby but that will be it or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you you know just continue right on with your work I mean it really is coming to that because most women now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them They can't even afford to take off you know to have children it seems like Yeah Right Now I was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where you know when I had them and when they were small until my youngest got in junior high I didn't have to work I mean I didn't work I needed to but I didn't Let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you wo- you know Oh yeah Right right Well it's getting where if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two And I mean it's hard with two now we uh my youngest one I have two I have a son and a daughter and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon and if I had a third one I just don't know where it would come from Because I work now I work full time and uh you know it when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got They get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that that helps out but still it cost a lot Right and cars and all their books and the books are outrageous I mean absolutely outrageous and they're getting worse Uh my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for one of her next classes and it was like ninety-six dollars And this book is a little bitty skinny book I said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know uh But it's getting worse and if I'd of probably had three or four children I don't see how we could have made it you know without me working Right but I think I would have had to work If I'd of had that many I'd of had to work in order for my kids to you know even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up I would have had to work But I think it's getting more and more like when you have one child now that's it you know then you go to work and you work because if you have two or three kids by the way the inflation's going I think a woman's always going to have to work and it's just going to be an accepted thing There isn't going to be any of this you know very few people will ever stay home Yeah Well you know I can't imagine how I did because now I work all the time and um well I work all week and um I can't imagine how I stayed home You know I think to myself what did I do And I think it revolutionized where a woman thinks that a way you know just like now my daughter there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now To her everything is you've got to go through college you've got to get a job you know And then when everything's set up then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with but I mean it is so far down the road now when I graduated high school the thing uh-huh and then you got married and then you had a family I mean that's just the way it was you know And uh that's like when my mo- I know when my mother's age it was always the kids and the family and everything had to come first and the woman stayed home and took care of them an Yeah Uh-huh Yeah but you know that now even whenever I was coming up and everything and we got married right out of high school well a year after I got out of high school and uh I didn't have kids for four and a half years but that was because I wanted to work and I wasn't ready for kids And everybody thought oh my gosh what is the matter with her you know Right I mean they thought that it was terrible you know and then when I'd tell them you know well I'm just not ready for children yet oh but that you know you better just get ready now Well you don't just get ready But I was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year And I just was not ready for kids I wanted to get out and work a little bit and I wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did And uh kids didn't fit in right then but it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples and really if you don't want the kids then it's not the time to have I don't care what anybody tells you And I think that more and more the attitude's getting that way Because that's like my daughter now she says that you know maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then And uh even though I'd like to have grandchildren I can see her point Right Uh-huh Yeah Yeah and it really is I know just like now you know there's so much more now All my income goes for things like luxuries I mean it really does Accept for what we give to my daughter to you know put her through college and stuff Spelling/usage: "Accept" should be "Except"  But the rest of it we just buy things like boats or we go on trips the more or less like entertainment stuff but Yeah I feel like I have you know because well we're just a age now I'm not old but I'm older And uh I got to stay home with my kids which I really wanted to do but now I could not go back and do it I really couldn't I don't think I could stay home all the time and do nothing Looks like 2 slash units  And I mean I did stuff but to me it feels like I must have done nothing And I think it's just the new way that people are thinking But uh Well you know more and more of them are I don't know if it is up there where you are but where I am just like all the hospitals they're getting day care But the reason they had to do this was because you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids or even if you had two kids you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go So uh more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies but it's mainly the hospitals Oh really
