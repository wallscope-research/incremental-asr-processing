Okay there's one uh I meant living in Texas where you at In where Rome New York Rome New York okay well Texas let me look at my husband and ask him <> Yes they do He's reminding me of where I live yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes Yeah uh I ethically don't like the idea or I should say morally I don't like the idea but uh socially and ethically I think it's a good idea in certain crimes Uh-huh Uh-huh Right any on the street no I know Uh-huh Yeah and Texas is having a problem right now and I think that's the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done oh heinous things from killing police officers to I mean just multiple you know molestations to murders of children just you know really bad things and these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered and now they can't find them and they're finding bodies in di- you know I mean you think why they say it's because it's over crowded and you think how is everybody that stupid or is the world really that rotten I know And then I don't know how Americans are about handguns but uh yesterday a lady I work with just told me today that uh in the state capitol here in Austin Texas they had been uh looking at a bill uh making it easier to accept the bill to access handguns and they passed it which basically means without an F B I check any person here in this state over twenty-one can get a gun Is it that's good Say that good I think that's like the state of Virginia yeah that's great Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right they're no the cattiness behind right yeah I mean I don't like guns in general but when I think about uh this topic like capital punishment I mean I just remember when I was in college in a dorm and I think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in Florida in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case and how they just exe- well it hasn't been just but it was in the I think the second or third quarter of last year nineteen ninety and you know I knew some people that said why are you glad you di- you know this is nothing and I said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but I mean <> there should be more cases like that where I might be too cold too but they flip a switch I don't know I mean So many times Yeah Yeah I mean and that's just maybe because of the little more they said celebrated that uh he's not the only one you know you see somebody's mini series and you hear about somebody's crime there was something on and this gets back to capital punishment but the man had stolen uh not stolen but kidnapped uh some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in Florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true and they buried her alive and Peter Strauss had played the lead role and you know how they have these mini dramas at the end they said this set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking oh that's nice I mean you know I'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence but it does serve as a you know lasting punish- Right in that particular instance uh but I know it's on a and be all that's the problem I have with it in Texas they think it's and be all they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something or gas somebody uh that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime ridden and we just moved here uh we've been here before lived in Minneapolis Saint Paul uh which has an exceedingly low crime rate and then we were transferred back here and when you're gone from some place for about six years as we were you really begin to see uh just how problematic just living is even suburban no matter where you are and how you're in Rome New York is that and is that like near Albany or Syracuse what type of area is that is that in term Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure how is the situation in there in terms of crime and things that would not too bad Yeah Uh-huh Not the harsh criminality that you find in yeah now Dallas is a I'm being very sarcastic it's just a great uh on some days uh it's uh I don't know the good ole boy network here is uh very strange like I said they believe that if they kill somebody you know tit for tat and deed for deed that that does something uh but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that I mean they really are over crowded I mean that's just not a cop out uh and  I just + you know I'm originally from Pennsylvania which I think is basically like New York these days I don't think they have capital punishment there Uh-huh Yeah and I'm from Pittsburgh so oh well we'll forgive each other Uh because they use to be very very conservative when I was growing up I haven't lived there in twenty years but uh There you go I don't know that's a different subject altogether but uh I don't know I think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime I think everyone would you and I think are honest and candid because we could do it in this vehicle uh but I think everybody if they were touched by it would say if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out I think every human does I think they'd say yeah do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me you know uh Uh-huh Yeah I just don't think that uh you can rehabilitate I mean I just don't uh oh I did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class and I just the subject I remember we drew things out of a hat and uh it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and when you see how many repeat offenders there are uh check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and uh rapist getting their hand just slapped you know and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session you know all these uh intangible things and you're thinking oh not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldn't want to be a criminal either because you wouldn't know what you're getting uh but I don't know methods of capital punishment I have no opinions on that either I just Uh-huh Is it uh how about the injection is that suppose to be Yeah I'm not even sure in the split among the fifty states do you know which way it is the ratio it's more than aren't uh it's more that don't have it isn't that correct Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I don't know if they did something about I'm not sure if Texas Minnesota they were again- well did they have it they were against it uh Texas as I said has it but I haven't been back here long enough to realize if they've done it in the last
