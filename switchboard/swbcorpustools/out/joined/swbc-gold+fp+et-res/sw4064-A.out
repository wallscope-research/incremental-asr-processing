Well how do you feel about trial by jury In what way Oh do you feel they are swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits So do you think that I mean the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry Uh-huh <> the only thing that really bothers me about that is I think you know that a judge can be I like the idea of juries of your peers uh in that you get personally more than one person making a decision And second of all you get a wide variety of background so that Uh-huh I'd agree with that That's definitely a problem Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah yeah I guess I definitely agree with you but the well what I don't like about uh the jury doing the sentencing in that I think it becomes a lot less the same crime gets unequal sentences uh I think there is more of an ability you know you know for selecting two different juries that would most of the time come up with uh the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent but I think there would be a large variation in trying to gage the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that measure stick across the board Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Of course a lot of that's also the ability of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer Uh-huh Yeah I agree Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah I agree with it yeah They will admit to you that they don't have the benefit of being able of allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument That the <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh this is a little bit of the subject but one thing that I really dislike uh also that's new is that I have heard that there are federal sentences
