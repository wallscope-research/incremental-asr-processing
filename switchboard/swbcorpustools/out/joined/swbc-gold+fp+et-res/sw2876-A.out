All right uh how long have they been recycling there in Virginia Yeah uh-huh <> <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh <> Hello Yeah okay you're okay okay Uh-huh have you recycled plastic also we have out here uh up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way they had some bends sp: bins around that we could find and put them in but not all that many it wasn't very well advertised but recently uh the refuse department uh is working on getting a system going where we will actually have uh a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things so it should be good uh I think it's a marvelous idea uh when I just think of the papers that I dump out I mean there just it's such a I waste I just hate to think about it Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh Yeah that's neat Yeah Yeah that's right I guess one of the things I think that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about it there's needs to be more public uh service programs or something that would let us know had happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening and there's I've seen a few things but not very much really and I think that's a shame they need to uh do a little more I'd like to know for instance when they say uh plastic all plastic what kind of plastic can you put all together or is there some reason not to uh now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use I don't know but I'd be glad to organize it if they'd tell me what it is I'm doing because that would be really helpful sep utt because as D  Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh that's great Now that gives you a little bit of incentive there Uh-huh Saving them for you uh Uh-huh I think that's right I think helping us be more enthusiastic about it helping us maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt slash error Making sure slash error But I think that's I think there needs to be a little bit more in the area of uh advertisement and public letting you understand more of what it is you're doing why you're doing it how it's done and what happens to it because I think that would help a lot Yeah Yeah I Yeah Yes I'm glad to see some of these things I think People are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped and all these things that I think that's true Well I think I'm that's about my uh some on recycling but I enjoyed talking to you Uh-huh all right bye now
