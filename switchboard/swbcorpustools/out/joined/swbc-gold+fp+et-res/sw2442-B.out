Okay are you on an exercise program now or Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah Um the only exercise program I'm doing right now is walking I've got a nine month old and I'm four months pregnant with my second and so at the time walking seems to be the best It's something I can do with her plus um doesn't tax me too physically I have enjoyed aerobics in the past and I enjoy that because I like the group association you know like exercising with other people um and that's my favorite way to exercise Oh Yeah it's nice to do it together too I guess My husband and I use to walk together but our schedules don't coincide as well as they used to and so we very seldom get together to walk but when you work out do you pretty much do it on your own schedule or do you go to groups or Uh-huh Uh-huh And then you can do it whenever you want I guess Uh-huh I guess it depends on the person depends on how motivated you are Because my husband used to work out three days a week uh at the Texas Instruments gym And then I would just go on Saturdays But since the first of the year neither one of us have been going So I guess like I say we've been paying these fees and not going so it's kind of a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it Yeah Yeah With the walking I think they said you need to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically <> beneficial And I have two friends that we walk They have babies that are about the same ages as mine and we've been walking every morning going when it was cold we would go to the mall because you can't take the babies out very easily So when we go we do about fifteen miles a week but the last little while for one reason or another we haven't been real consistent So <> it's a little harder when you're depending on other people to do it with you because you have to meet their schedules as well but I enjoy doing it more when I've got other people with me You know I usually do it because I want to because I know it's good for me not because I don't feel obligated to do it I enjoy it If I feel too obligated to do it I start to rebel and I won't be as consistent with it I exercised pretty well up uh until I was pregnant and I started having pains So I've calmed down everything except I was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the um walking And I had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of <> painful But the T I rec center has an aerobics program for um prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing And I was going to wait until um about my sixth month and then start that I did that with the second baby and um I went to my exercise class one day and then she was delivered the next day So it would seem to be real beneficial Well I think it made parts of it a lot easier and is this your first that you're having Oh okay well then I don't know how much you've been through it but I think parts of it made a lot easier And I've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and didn't with the other and they said that the one they had exercised with was three or four times easier And I had having both of them natural the first one was natural and going natural the second and it's rough but it's not as bad as I thought it would be and I think the exercise helped So do you work with T I Oh okay well then she could go if she were interested I think that's what the class that meets on Saturday mornings So she could find out if she wanted to go It's kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy and they would talk about exercise and just general things relating to the birthing process And so for us it was educational as well as exercise beneficial So That's right Yeah And sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like Well I've done a good job because I worked myself to that point But I guess that you don't want to overdo But <> well have we reached our limit I'm not sure how long we've been talking but Okay well it's been good talking to you Okay I hope your baby comes out well Bye-bye
