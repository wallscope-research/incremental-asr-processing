Uh I get most of my news uh from newspapers really I read the daily newspaper uh the HOUSTON CHRONICLE and sometimes I'll read like the uh WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES I don't subscribe to either but sometimes I get a hold of copies of it Uh how about you Do you uh mostly get things from T V or Oh Oh that's interesting You said computer networks Uh uh what sort I am fairly knowledgeable of <> Uh okay That's interesting Oh I- is it the A P news wire or is it something that is uh a little bit different from that Uh okay So that's interesting Okay Yeah I had access in the past to uh uh the A P news wire and I thought that was a pretty good way to get news Uh I've never used the DOW JONES news wire but uh yeah it uh uh do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach Yeah In what way in sort of like uh uh quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever Yeah Well you won't offend me So go ahead and say Yeah Like a liberal type of bias Yeah Yeah Yeah they generally make mistake on anything technical at least <> Yeah Yeah by mistakes do you mean just like honest mistakes or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Huh Huh That's disturbing I haven't really noticed them doing that but whatever again I don't watch T V news that much now If I had access to C N N I would watch T V news more Uh you know but I don't usually Yeah did you think that well the Gulf War coverage would be kind of uh an abnormality I just wonde- I guess I would be curious to know what you thought as to how like say C N N T V news compared to the three networks Uh you know whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever but I guess you wouldn't You probably if you just watched it during the Gulf War that probably wouldn't tell you much Yeah Yeah
