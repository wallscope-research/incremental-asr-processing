Well I grew up out in the country and uh was used to having uh guns around the place and uh I'm uh not for gun control in the strictest sense of the uh word Yeah Yeah Yeah Well I feel that its uh I think what was National Rifle Association uh had this bumper sticker a few years back uh about if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns then And I believe that too because the person that is wanting to commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gun a knife a rock a stick whatever it is to commit a crime with and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns uh we can handle it but there's an element that can't They have got them outgunned There was an article in the paper just this week where I think it's uh one of the gun companies I can't remember which was developing a ten millimeter automatic pistol for the F B I which would give them additional firepower It had held like a fifteen shot clip which uh they would be able to put down anything that came at them but you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun uh a thirty-eight uh Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good Yeah I have lived in uh Illinois at one time and they passed a uh it wasn't really gun control but it was you had to register as a gun owner you didn't have to list your guns but you had to have this card it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition and that was the first uh this was twenty years ago But they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect Pardon Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah We lived in Tennessee for awhile and I bought a pistol there and there was a fifteen day waiting period You had to fill out an application and go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted and then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing No I think that uh you know a waiting period uh can make a difference but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that So I don't think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because Right right Yeah I'm we're getting into capital punishment now But I agree with you there that uh Yeah again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be It's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one And I'm in favor of keeping the illegal guy from getting one in his hands but the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element Oh yes Yeah You don't have to carry one in your car uh or your pocket all the time Yeah Yeah Yeah Well I know what uh I took my kids out and taught them out how to shoot a gun My wife the same thing uh she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not that I have an arsenal or anything but we have several guns around the house one of these days my grandkids probably But I think it's uh you got to have the living in Dallas there's not that many places to go shoot but uh still I think they ought to know how to use one and that it's not just a toy and that it's not like on T V when someone gets shot uh they get back up If someone gets shot with a real gun they don't get back up Yeah Yeah I remember I had an old uncle up by Tulsa Oklahoma that took me out and uh showed me it was my mother's uncle this was a gentleman in his sixties and he took me out with him and uh single shot twenty-two and taught me how to shoot We went squirrel hunting and uh he taught me how to shoot uh a old single shot twenty-two and I was probably about twelve at the time and I thought that was the neatest thing and of course Uncle Sam took me hunting with him and he let me shoot and showed me how Right Oh yeah Well that's about all I we agreed pretty well on this I think Okay Well it's been real nice talking with you Okay bye
