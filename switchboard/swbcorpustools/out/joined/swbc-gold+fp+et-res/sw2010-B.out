Hi Archie I'm Sharon Yeah I've seen that uh that was a really good movie Probably one of the best things about it was the scenery and uh I thought the story was pretty good too I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it No I haven't Um I've visited the Wyoming area I'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH WOLVES was filmed Could be I haven't been to South Dakota have you been up to that Oh Okay Terrain Really That's true I agree with that Um I noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it I think it's been nominated for twelve awards and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud So it has surprised everybody Uh-huh Right Did you Have you seen SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY you have to go see that one And how about SILENCE OF THE LAMB Go I do I go every weekend I uh those are two definite must see movies I think It's suspenseful I don't think it's very t- I mean there's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that it's more suspense Um the other one SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is kind of a gory movie if somebody's not into that kind of stuff it's pretty graphic at points But uh I think they're both excellent movies No Huh-uh two utts Yeah Somebody in South Carolina told me about him Yeah Oh Uh-huh I think he really his heart was in it but I don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was I think it was something that he really wanted to do He wanted to direct it he wanted to star in it You know he enjoyed the story line and I think he really wanted it And whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office I think he would have been happy Because I think he did a good job and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him Um Yeah Who no I don't know who that guy is Oh he does As a recurring character every week Oh No now see I'd a never put those two together Huh-uh Yeah Yeah real scruffy looking Yeah You think so I mean I haven't been watching my watch Um I guess yeah Does it usually cut off Is that what it does it used to just automatically cut off but it says when the conversation is over just say your good-byes and hang up So I guess so Okay Good talking to you Archie
