Okay Oh well actually I'm from California and before then I was from Utah So Well I grew up in California and then I went to school in Utah and I got married there and we stayed there for a while and then now we're in Iowa Oh really Oh Um Well I crochet and I do water color and I um sew and I do fabric painting Um I've done some cross stitching I haven't tried any needlepoint yet How about you Oh right Oh really Uh-huh Oh gosh Oh yeah well those take a lot of time I only can do things that are pretty fast because we just um got our baby last year and I just don't have the patience to just you know do something Uh-huh Um I crocheted an afghan for our bed That's the only thing and I did a quilt let's see I've done a quilt for our baby and I've done a quilt for our bed but I mean Um Um our baby's quilt it was like the design I just went around the design in the quilt I didn't piece it or anything like that but uh Uh-huh and Um I put it on the quilting frame are you familiar with that Yeah okay Oh my God Well I haven't done tons of them But um I used to do more before we got our baby but Uh-huh Yes exactly Well one thing that I like about this fabric painting thing is I can just make a T shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then um cut out a little pattern from some material like flowers or something and make um a design or you know a little arrangement or something on the shirt and you know fuse it on with Heat and Bond or whatever and then paint around it And I usually sew around the flower whatever first and then I paint around it so you can't see the stitching as much does that make sense to you So Oh Oh sure Uh-huh Oh really Oh Well Yeah someone told me that they had done it both ways and after hearing that I always sewed it on even with uh a loose zigzag even helps And um
