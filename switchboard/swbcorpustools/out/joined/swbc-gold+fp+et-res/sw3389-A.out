So who's your favorite team Pittsburgh I used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little Oh really Huh That's pretty nice Yeah that's good I used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big or steel curtain Huh Well last year it was Buffalo and I still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just impressed me as being so efficient and they never score They never blow out their opponents They just score just enough points and that really impressed me But then down here I li- is pretty close to New Orleans and I've been keeping up with the Saints a lot Yeah the Saints are starting to impress me this year you know a lot they are really Did you see the game or Sunday afternoon It was funny they ha- uh a fireworks display at halftime Yeah and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire So they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter and put out this fire Those big piece of something came falling out of the roof and landed on the field so there's this big fire on the field and they were dumping the Gatorade bucket and everything It was funn- I mean you just really can't tell what's going to happen I know It's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints And Morton Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal And it was beautiful right down the middle He is Yes Uh I sure hope so I'm not sure who they play Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams It's pretty much going between Washington They are undefeated And uh Buffalo New Orleans and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice and one of those was to Buffalo And they beat the Saints Their only time they lost Houston I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis Yeah Uh from what I saw they were playing when I was at the game we sat right on the front row right behind the Houston Oilers and from what I saw the game Houston impressed me a lot But my brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night and if that was an off night I'd hate to see when he's on a good night He's Yeah their backfield is really impressive Haywood Jeffreys and Drew Hill and Allen they really impress me That's right who did they play Dallas that's right all because That's right I remember that now Do you have a favorite between those two Really Well that's true I hate to say it but I hate Dallas Yeah Yeah I imagine That's the way I've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two and they've actually started doing something So I've actually paid attention to them Well do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in Really Uh right now I think this Memphis they're trying to get the teams And that's where I was when I saw uh Houston play Saint Louis is trying to get a team Uh Baltimore is trying to get a team and there's some other city I'm wanting to say Raleigh Durham but I'm not sure Think so Uh-huh Because I know they've got a football team but I think it might be them I would definitely I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after And right now I think it's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it Because I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis and when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did Yeah It's like the or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two
