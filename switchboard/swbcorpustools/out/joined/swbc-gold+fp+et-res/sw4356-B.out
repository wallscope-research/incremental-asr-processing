<> I've heard some about Saturns I don't know a lot about them I haven't been over uh to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight's paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of I guess the Japanese cars comment on trans delete line Uh-huh Yeah Um Yeah I've heard a lot of people like them Uh yet I don't know whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point I'm kind of my card and uh desires tend to be pretty picky and so uh Well let's see I like cars that are designed with human beings in mind and that's not just the driver and the passenger but that's the person who's working on it cause I do almost all my own maintenance and uh those types of things And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in uh finding a car anymore that's fairly easy for me to work on it's not very almost unlikely at this point And uh yo- Ooh Uh-huh Yeah Well I've got an eighty-three Saab And I find that for you know everyday things It's really very easy to work on and so uh you know I'm kind of spoiled I used to have a Chevy With a three fifty in it And uh I really liked working on it Uh cause it was pretty easy too It was about a nineteen seventy So I'm kind of uh biased in that and you know I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore And that's probably one thing I'd look at I think another thing I'd look at is safety Huh That's a real nice car I think I've driven some uh Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips Uh as rental cars And I've always been very impressed with the Taurus It's a really nice car I think it's a stylish car both inside and out It's comfortable to drive Uh reasonable performance and this is out in California where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore Uh I've been real impressed with that Yo- and I didn't realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now Uh-huh Oh I think That's excellent That's excellent because Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Those are yeah that would be a good deal to go with Okay Uh-huh what do you looking for in those what attracts you to the Saturns or of course we've already talked you know the Taurus is safe But what kind of things are you looking for Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Okay
