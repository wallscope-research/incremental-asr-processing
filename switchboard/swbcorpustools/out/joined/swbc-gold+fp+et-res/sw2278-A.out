Well I kind of like them all I played for about eighteen years all the way through college and then uh kind of hung them up after college but No not quite Made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball but Anyway Uh being in Rochester you probably like the Mets Oh boy I think it's like one or the other isn't it I mean Yeah Oh okay I see yeah I like the uh huh I guess if I had to pick a favorite team any more as well as I kind of grew up rooting for Philadelphia I'm from New Jersey originally Yeah well we were thirty miles south of them so Yeah right down the river but uh so what are the Mets going to do this year without Strawberry Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well I was going to talk to you about that eighty-six team that was the year they beat Houston in extra innings right Yeah Hey the guy's making millions he ought to be able to perform right Well his knees were bothering him yeah Yeah for having him out there Sure Oh boy Yeah I think we were all pretty much uh Astros fans in the National League Championship Series but there's like two fellows from uh Brooklyn and you know they were pretty much without having to say they were pretty much Mets fans No not really they were pretty much thugs they weren't scared very much you know Yeah Really Okay okay Well I'm not to say that all folks from Brooklyn are thugs but these two were definitely thugs and they were from Brooklyn So I'm kind of hoping I guess uh any more I pretty much pull for the Rangers though they're they  + they have  + I think they have  the best facilities in the major leagues I love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium It's great Yeah The only problem is it's not large enough It only holds about I think they when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player they squeezed about forty thousand people in there Yeah so they have plans I mean the owner tried to move them to Florida but uh they ended up sticking around in Arlington and they're going to build a new stadium in Arlington as a matter of fact not even in Dallas So that's something that we're looking forward to Oh case in point Toronto Yeah have you seen a game up there Oh boy I saw it I was up there on business uh last June and watched a game in the sky dome It was just phenomenal that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums I think Uh-huh Now is Rochester where is Cornell University Ithaca Okay Yeah well Rochester is like right on the shores isn't it Yeah okay Oh Well they say that from that space needle up in Toronto you can see the lights of Rochester on a clear night Yeah Yeah Yeah okay Yeah Those games are fun to watch you watch those games Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah Yeah we used to like watching my folks lived down in Beaumont and uh on the campus of Lamar University they used to house the Beaumont Golden Gators who were a double A team for the Padres I think but uh they were fun games to watch Someti- well there's definitely a lot more hitting Yeah Yeah So as far as the major league teams I don't know the Rangers have been you know every year they always knock on the door early and then just go into their skid about you know the end of June But they've got so much young raw talent it's just amazing and then they just haven't been able to put anything together Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right Yeah I mean they've been young for a while and they're almost starting to age a little bit here I just um Yeah yeah they really hurting pitching wise I mean they've got Ryan but you know who knows what he'll be able to do He's been last year he started having some nagging injuries but it'll be interesting to watch I hope to get up there we usually try to get to opening day game There's several guys from our church try to go up there Yeah well I guess we're oh maybe a hundred fifty miles south of Dallas No not too bad but it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there That's probably because of the roads You just don't have we've just got a freeway We just get right on the freeway and just go north Well it's so crowded up there Golly Yeah Um Well yeah you're like a boat ride from how far is it across the lake to Canada Toronto Yeah do you drive there or do you take the ferry or what Yeah Yeah it's a beautiful city Uh-huh and then I mean you go back to New York after school Oh really Well what kind of weather are you having right now Oh boy yeah we've been up in the oh seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple of weeks ago Golly Because of the ice Um Golly Huh illegal Oh yeah
