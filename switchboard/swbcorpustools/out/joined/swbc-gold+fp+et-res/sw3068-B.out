Yeah In fact I'm still going Uh well I don't know about that but in fact I'm in the process of trying to choose a P H D school Uh well computer science and cognitive science So Oh I see Oh yeah Yeah To a parent Well you know the thing is when you're a kid and the kid at that age especially if they're going into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want and I mean choosing from my experience you know I thought you know I know what I want a lot more than my parents know what I want But uh I don't know at the same time you have to decide what is important about the school you know the size of it or Yeah Yeah Yeah That's disruptive Oh yeah Yeah Well yeah I see what you're saying Yeah Uh <> give me five minutes Yeah Yeah I'm just getting ready to go to lunch Uh yeah that's like what we were saying though would you uh advise a private school or a public school you know what's the trade off there what Oh I see Yeah Yeah yeah I think uh I would agree with that In fact I'm going through the same thing where in graduate school I was trying to choose You know a particular institution might be better for my area yet + like say you know the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something might have some top specialists in my area Yet  if I go to U of I or C M U or you know you know any big name school my quality of education might not be that much better but it's the same thing there's you know what will the name recognition get me kind of thing Yeah yeah that's usually the basic criteria Yeah Oh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah I guess another thing that concerns me is uh it seems like everybody today is still in that job market <> and uh um where was I at Oh in going to school you get taught the things you learn in school but there is also a whole other dimension I mean the growing up while you're going to school part And uh actually in the Midwest especially a lot of the schools like University of Missouri will have a main campus like Columbia which is big multi disciplinary and they'll have a satellite campus usually in a smaller town that specializes in the technical field So you've really uh I guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything Yeah
