Well what do you think in terms of uh benefits Absolutely Well I have to agree with that You know I was thinking about uh importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while I was waiting for uh the system to find a respondent And I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and I suspect that that's probably true for everyone When I was much younger it was uh less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits But as I grow older and my family grows the medical benefits are more important and the retirement is more important I think they have uh one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the uh CODA Plan It's certainly a supplemental way uh and I suppose maybe in your instance if you're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five then you'll have a very good retirement plan But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later So it's not uh all by itself it won't be adequate for my situation So I have to find a way to supplement that I understand though it Uh believe me I do that myself And I disagree with you I don't think it's the worst investment in the world Well it's in terms of guaranteed return on investment and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed until later Uh it's shown a history that uh sure beats anything else Over many many years I understand that approach that's exactly what's happening in my family except that mine are a little bit older and I've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there You better make sure that you've got a scholarship slash error I know slash error should be 'aa' And boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them Uh I have an eleven year old daughter now who's saying gee Dad I want to be an allergist and I said that's wonderful I applaud that Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that And then her little brother's only two years behind and he says well I don't know I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian And I said that's great Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that Well that's fantastic and on whole I would say that they're equal to uh most of our competitors Uh I can see some potential changes that probably would not cost very much but might uh make things a little easier Such as offering a smorgasbord Having a larger variety of benefits but here's the amount that T I is going to pay for it now it's up to you it's menu selection so to speak Well I could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a standardized compensatory time for overtime And I don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that Uh and I would certainly support something like four to one or five to one or you know maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one Uh as a repayment for every three to five days that I work overtime there they should give me one day But it should be a standard and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate uh that's running in each department Well that's for sure Oh I'm sure personalities always come into play Uh just in this size of organization
