Well how many credit cards do you have Sounds like we have no conflict We had for a while I was carrying one card and my wife was carrying a different one And since the slips all look alike uh you commingle them and then you get the statement and you try to sort them out uh and uh it caused more confusion about it I finally said Gee this is kind of a waste of time And then when A T and T came along and offered a free one uh I accepted that and we've been using that one Uh the interesting thing is uh the amount of money you can run up on them I don't know do you know any people that run up big bills Well um were you able to get one while you're in college Just curious because I have a son that's a senior this year and he's heading off with any kind of luck but there has been I've had a couple of ads to provide a card for a college student Uh what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that Well I guess from the card issuer uh that since the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible but it's Yes it's whether the parent wants to take the risk Yeah to go run up a big bill and the thing is there some advantages if he got off some place and stranded I'm leaning towards doing it for a convenience Yeah and the idea that you know if he got in trouble there's some ways of getting out and that he doesn't have to carry cash The uh I like the idea of credit cards that uh I don't carry cash around and uh I don't even carry checks around I let my wife take the checkbook and she writes the checks and I record them So but it's interesting that uh uh the amounts of money you can run up on credit cards and uh I had recently had some dealings with a fellow that he was making oh considered a modest salary for an engineer and he had run up uh more than a years salary in various debts to and he wound up declaring bankruptcy but there it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of uh well it was a combination of things he had there were several credit cards and then there were several other businesses but uh I guess what's interesting have you seen the ads where they're offering to extend payments from uh things uh like the credit union's offering should be more than 1 slash unit Yes yeah The interesting thing about that is that they're encouraging you to incur more debt and And they make more money if you extend your loan Yes And they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely die of service listen; can't be right transcription they're not going to keep on if the car were older The interesting thing about it is that or in economics I think it's poor uh economics to carry all that consumer debt at least from a tax standpoint so It's interesting that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible and this year it's ten percent or so uh it's interesting that uh they encourage us to do things I think ten percent yes of your consumer credit Oh if you had a thousand dollars that means there's another hundred dollar deduction I've given you Yeah it's on uh yeah Yeah on the there's a place for consumer debt and then you take ten percent of it on the Oh okay It's on um Schedule A under uh well it's the same place you put uh interest but see that's what makes Texas squirrelly laws that you can't take out a second mortgage like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that and so uh it's fully deductible The laws are a little squirrelly but it basically comes down to it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint But uh anyway Sounds like you're very financially responsible uh That's uh there're a lot of people who really run my boss drives quite a ways to work and he's got just enormous debts and he's but I mean what do you say it's like Shucks Boss I'm sure sorry you've got all that debt Well he's had two kids in college and this kind of thing and that I think that the whole credit card issue I think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts but I agree with you I my debts Well I did buy a new house last summer it's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car and uh apparently that's been going on for a really long time I didn't do it I bought a second hand car when I was the middle of my senior year Yep Miscellaneous things like food and other things these habits you get into eating and uh it's amazing what you learn Well anything else good to say about credit cards I might just You don't have to carry the cash uh and it's certainly accepted the places you know it's hard to cash a check if you're out of state and Yeah they don't do tha- Yeah Carry all that cash with you Well you know they've started towards a little bit of the debit card have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you Yeah and I think that's where Yeah I've seen a couple although the so many of the grocery stores don't do that because of the time frame which they get paid in general that uh they I've seen checks I mean cleared my account the next day My wife will write a check for groceries and you know almost well I guess it's the day after uh technically it's two days but they took that check and scurried it to the bank and the bank scurried it back to my account and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float but apparently that's why uh the uh grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high and they have uh the costability of the cash flow is a big issue for them Anyway Well it's good talking to you Maybe we'll cross paths again Good night
