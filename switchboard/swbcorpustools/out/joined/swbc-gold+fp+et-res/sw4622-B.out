Well let's see It turns out that uh TEK- I work at TEKTRONIX and it's a very uh low key place as far as dress goes You just wear uh let's see When I first came here I wore suits but after a while I got uh found out that that wasn't all that important I'm an engineer And uh so I get to wear just uh how shall I say it uh walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and well walking how shall I say it kind of like Avia uh walking shoes uh Yes Open shirt open at the neck you know no tie And uh just uh reasonable looking how shall I say it uh sports clothes or some guys wear some people even wear Levis Now being from Philadelphia I don't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed right Oh okay Uh-huh Yes Yeah well I uh I just recently applied for a different job in the company here and so I decided well I'd wear a suit And it it was very interesting uh like I said most of the people at at this company don't wear suits Uh most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual almost the same clothes that that you'd wear to school Well it has been Although the new president and C E O of the company is from a much more formal eastern uh background And so the result is that uh so anyway I wore this suit and I went over to uh uh to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it and it and I I was almost converted because uh the effect of that suit on the way people res- reacted and responded to me as opposed to the uh just to kind of how shall I say it they know you're there but they don't uh you don't there's no notice at all But when I wore a suit that day uh it was obvious that people didn't know whether I was a worker bee or a manager So people uh how shall I say it made a made much more effort to notice you acknowledge your presence say hello and uh things like that so Yeah And so this dress for success thing I think is uh by and large I've I'm kind of uh convinced that uh by that just that one uh uh experience and then having talked to several other people that that uh unless you're in a an environment where they're going to make fun of of of better clothes that better clothes always pay off Doesn't mean they have to be uh how shall I say it th- they don't have to be the the most uh the absolute best but uh a little dressing a little bit above the standard I think would uh pay off so I'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again And uh I I don't know now I I know eastern now the other thing we do here of course is a single not quite a single climate We have uh we do have some snow in the wintertime and it can be quite warm in the summertime Not hot like uh I lived in the midwest for a while And I know that uh you know it can be freezing cold in the wintertime and hot and uh sticky in the summertime We don't have that much It's uh it's a very mild climate Yes it is
