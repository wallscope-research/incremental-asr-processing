Uh-huh yeah they seem to be a part of life Yeah how do you use them Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I use a few uh I watched my grandmother go into debt on them and so I've and then I guess my mother Yeah so my mother learned from that and I guess she taught me to be very very careful with them So basically uh I just keep them I use them so that I build up a credit rating you know But otherwise uh I generally and my husband it turns out I've just been married seven months but he has the same habit and we just keep a you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something but we always pay it off right that month so that we don't pay any service charge So that way we keep out of debt and we keep on top of what we're spending Yeah Yeah yeah that's what I feel So Uh-huh It's really easy just to forget you know that you charged that or charged that I try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill's going to come but sometimes I forget and so you know a bill will come in and I'll think oh no I didn't know it was going to be that high But so far we've been able to pay it off every time so Uh-huh Uh-huh Um Yeah Have you ever used Discover card Yeah I'm not even sure what their interest rate is since I pay it off but you know Uh I think Sears originally put it out but uh it's pretty well taken all over the U S now I mean uh I've haven't found many places that don't take Discover And there's no annual service fee which is good You know and then uh they also give you they say cash back uh like at the end of the year For the amount that I charge I get two dollars back or something but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back Yeah basically That's it And I think the service charge is pretty low too but I'm not sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I think it's best to keep the number down that you have So Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well Do you have anything else to say Okay I don't think I do either so Well it was good talking to you Okay Have a good evening Bye-bye
