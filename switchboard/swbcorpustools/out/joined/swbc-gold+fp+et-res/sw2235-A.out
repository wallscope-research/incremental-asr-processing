Okay Hi Um yeah Sure Um I think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back If you can't pay for it you shouldn't have it Period And That's just Uh-huh Well I don't have a Master Charge thank you Right But that's the problem see Our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that Yes they would They just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own Or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own We might have to you know just be able to I think if a generation went without debt then the next generation like if our generation my husband and I we're twenty-eight  if we lived our lives and didn't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us um the budget would balance And that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford which we wouldn't be destitute I mean we wouldn't be living on the street by any means But just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds but I feel like the generation after us would oh man it would be so good It would be so much better It wouldn't be perfect but then they could learn to live with what they could afford to save to buy And if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer Uh-huh But see we made poor choices in college We took out two both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans for student loans and I look back on that and I bought shoes I went shopping I did not need that money I did not need it I didn't need it I shouldn't have even qualified to get it I didn't need it And it would have been a little rough I might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli but I did not need it And as I look back now now we're paying that back I told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans Don't do it And I don't think he'll have to do that/ but I just feel like if we didn't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that and I believe we would have because God's really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know But we have friends in church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free And they pay cash for everything they buy Including new vans and so I guess I've seen it done and I know you can do it you know But you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van And that's where Americans don't like to do it and we don't want to cut back our services from the government because we're spoiled What I know Yeah I know Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that is true Because I always think the mail never comes on these days and you're like well what is it You don't even know it's a holiday But isn't it in the federal budget But isn't it part of our income it's not part of our taxes It's not That's why it keeps going up uh That's another topic Those stamps are valuable now That's funny Yeah and that is a good short term thing though That little things like that overall though I just think we're just going to I don't know see I know I guess I'm kind of leery of this topic because I know that Bush is real for the new world order The one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations But I see that to be a potential power problem later with um who's going to be in charge with this new world order And you know I'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place But I know we already have a new money system We already have new bills printed for the U S Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency and I've seen them And so I know that the long-term vision for the U S government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh but I'm concerned with who's going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know That's a lot of power for one or two people to have And so um I guess because I I guess in fact I know what their long-term vision is I'm kind of like you know yeah the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles And I don't think Americans are willing to do it I don't feel we should loan them money If I wish our leaders were really seeking the Lord on these things and if we feel led to give a country money to help them fine But I don't feel we should be loaning money like that I mean it doesn't work I mean but it's not set up as a giveaway If it were set up as giveaway and it was something that I mean our President and our leaders could be seeking God saying God is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money is it your will this money and your will for us to give to them and I believe if we gave it no strings attached that God would bless our nation But because our motive is interest our motive is not pure it just backfires I mean none of these nations have paid us back But you understand I guess it's a principle of giving and receiving You give it no strings attached and they may never give you anything back but because there's no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back And it might not be money it might be um no taxes on our things our computers going into their nation it might come back in another way but it would be come back But because we're loaning it I think that's the problem And I don't mean give it to everybody that asks Use a lot of discernment Don't give money to every nation You know what I'm saying I think we're loaning money to too many nations but I think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them And so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money and so I just think we're never going to get that back you know Do you understand Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Right long term though do you think it would best to see a one world you know you can't alleviate all national debts or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking God on how to turn our nation around financially That's my opinion My opinion's the latter Uh-huh I know What's yours Do you agree or do you disagree or I mean what do you think long term Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I know Yeah Different ethnic groups Yeah I know what your saying typo your> you're Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh
