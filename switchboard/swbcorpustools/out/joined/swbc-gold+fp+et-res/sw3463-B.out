Uh oh I can start I think one of the biggest uh improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into uh management and you're seeing them uh get uh elected to uh political offices Uh not near enough I know there's still a long way to go especially in top management You're not seeing you know looking at T I you see them in management but you're not seeing them up there as V Ps And I have a sister that's an attorney in Oklahoma City and I know the company that she was with uh the women didn't have near the levels that the men attorneys had And were not uh given the same respect Yes Uh-huh uh-huh Right right Right I also think that uh uh women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be Used to be people would say do you work and you'd say no I work in the home and then it was almost like a put down particularly even by women in the work force But I think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very very important And it's getting the respect which is about time Yes very definitely That's right Right Yes and to those that have never worked you know and have stayed home with the kids kind of does your heart good Because I know I stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine were in high school uh so you know it kind of does me good I think also one of the things that's really tremendous and it doesn't necessarily have to do with women the fact that the fathers are so involved with families Which again I think helps a woman's role You know Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I had to course I work full time but my daughter and her husband were out of town so I had my grandchildren for four days during uh soccer season and so I would work and her some friends would take care of the kids but I would have to get them picked up from there get them fed get them to practices get homework done get baths I was absolutely exhausted and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties or early forties to have their first children I think are absolutely crazy Uh-huh
