Okay for as far as um I would think probably the uh worst substance that's probably um or started to say the uh what causes the most air pollution is probably the car and uh whether or not um they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed uh train or something like that or Yeah that's exactly it and that's what we're finding um here where we're at in Minneapolis area is that people don't want to carpool that there are inconveniences to that or maybe you don't like the person you would want to carpool with that kind of thing so it's kind of a thing where uh I think the majority of the people do not carpool Uh-huh Yeah Exactly Uh-huh or if somebody gets sick Yeah or if somebody gets sick and it's not the other person and they want to go home and that one person's got the car then they're stuck you're definitely right so slash error Yes slash error Uh-huh Sure Sure that happens quite a bit Yes yeah that's very true Uh other than that uh I don't know Okay Oh okay we'll try to be real quick here The other thing then is because I don't know how long they want us to talk Five minutes oh okay Minneapolis area Uh actually no We have uh quite a bit uh the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season you get some pollutants such as those but those are natural um but there is starting to in Minneapolis itself because of so many people on the highway there is becoming a problem of pollution and they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any uh lead into the air or other pollutants and if that's the case then you have to get your car fixed at least where you Sure yeah Yeah it's not a bad idea Uh-huh Sure sure Exactly Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Yeah Sure uh the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars uh air conditioning I'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it but it's uncomfortable but uh this year my husband recharged our freon because it needed to be done and one of the cans released entire amount of freon uh into the air because he opened it and I don't know if there was something wrong with it or his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that and I was thinking how many other people oh sure because if you take it into a service station they want to charge you forty dollars just for uh freon which only costs you about three dollars so I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say Hey that's right there I think it's like three or four dollars a can and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car and I thought about that and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because I'm sure he breathed it but uh you think about that all the people that are using freon and things like that and slash error Uh-huh slash error Exactly Pump yeah should this be two slash units/
