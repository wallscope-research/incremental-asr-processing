Uh I guess uh I like to play golf And uh I also like to plant flowers and do some gardening and do arts and crafts Well we live uh pretty close to the Mesquite Golf Course So we will play either out there or at Firewheel That is usually where we play but I have played you know different courses in in the Dallas area Uh both Not at the same time No sometimes we ride and sometimes uh we pull we like to to uh a lot of the times just walk uh for the exercise But I find that when I ride in a cart I play better and I think it is cause I don't get as tired Yeah I know and that makes me so mad <> You know like it is not going to do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently Yeah Right Right Well the reason why we play over there is because its where since we are a Garland resident they gave us a special deal where you can get uh ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars yeah a hundred dollars cause it is half price what the normal green fees are So that is why we you know play over there cause we have got our card Oh do you So you live in Garland then Okay well we are in south Garland but yeah next time you go uh you know check into it they have uh it is just like uh a bus card and they just punch it You know it has got one through ten on it and every time you go they just punch it for you Oh okay You must have a son Oh okay Yeah Oh well that sounds like fun too Uh-huh Well you need to uh teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you Oh yeah Well you can teach them Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Right Yeah I know what you mean Uh-huh Oh yeah it is just nice to get outdoors and do something Well flower gardens I like to have matter of fact this past weekend I just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs So those ought to be coming up around spring time Uh-huh Right Oh they do great I put mine in probably in November Yeah I think it was November and I don't do anything to mine water them or anything And they just they do really good and I even had uh I guess it was last year or the year before I had some out and it froze and the pansies looked terrible but they came back later I didn't do anything to them so uh they are good to plant in the winter time They last for a long time then So if you start putting them you know you can put them out in the spring too but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather No they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot but they make it through probably winter and spring So Yeah I have got some of those too cause I love flowers Yeah And I try to do some arts and crafts and I love to go
