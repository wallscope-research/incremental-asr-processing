Uh yeah I think so I think I'm uh a little out of the ordinary in that uh I think I'm more worried about the national deficit than uh a lot of other people are and think that we need to either raise our taxes or cutback on something and I don't know what to cutback on to get that settled uh and uh I know I'm uh out of it in terms of taxes so I'm uh think that we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do uh for Texas and Yeah I think so Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah Yeah yeah Yeah now uh uh oh I when we moved to Richardson one of the reasons we chose it was uh for the schools and realizing that that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing uh to go for that because we supported the Yeah Yeah Yeah I think that's right Yeah I don't know about that I I see Okay No uh Yeah well that would be true That would be true But Huh Yeah and even if it is isn't going to uh uh provide you with any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your home to a business for instance you know Yeah Yeah And Yeah and the other thing is that when the public transportation is established that early on then the uh business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that Whereas uh in Dallas here uh those patterns were well established before we really tried to do the DART And uh for instance all the uh office buildings and stuff that are out here in uh north Dallas as opposed to downtown uh to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the metroplex to uh both those centers of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area You know like New York does yeah Yeah Yeah Right right Yeah Oh yeah Yeah Yeah right Yep Yeah Yeah Yeah A little bit much Oh yeah Yep Yep Oh the c- Yeah I think so I think that will probably do it so Good enough Bye
