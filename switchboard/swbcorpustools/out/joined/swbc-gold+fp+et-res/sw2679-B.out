Um just here in Dallas Uh-huh That's yes yes that's true I've talked Uh-huh People from Virginia and all over Yeah Uh-huh Oh okay Um well the subject we're supposed to be talking about let's see is uh food What type of foods do you cook and what would you uh cook uh uh let's see if you were giving a dinner party And the only reason why I may know a little bit about this is that I'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon And to me that's the type of thing that I like to give in um uh cooking for people And uh if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and uh you don't have to do all that much work You know you just uh slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce and away you go Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh What kind of meals did she make that you liked Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh No Sounds interesting uh-huh Yeah that's great Yeah yeah But uh that's why I like the outdoor stuff a lot better People can entertain themselves I think a great deal more uh when you have a barbecue Especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and uh you know nothing really fancy like your shish kabobs where you have to do a whole bunch of work Uh-huh Right Yeah yeah Well I think you do a lot of work Even if people do bring over things you still do uh all the uh housework and get everything prepared and utensils and just everything Uh you know my mother used to make an Armenian rice dish I'm thinking about uh special dishes and uh yeah it was made out of rice and consume soup uh and bacon and onions And then you'd simmer it like all day long Oh it would Yeah And it was just wonderful that's something that I would really like uh to try and find the recipe for But we used to have that at Thanksgiving time Because you can put it on top of the stove and do this and there's so much broth and juice in there that it has to uh soak up into the rice all day long in order for it uh uh to come out fluffy and nice And that was you know when you were talking about the Polish dishes uh some goulashes and things like that uh that's what I thought about was that Armenian rice dish That's true That's true Uh-huh Right right Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right right Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah You know what I found was at Sam's uh Wholesale uh stores And uh what they have is this honey baked ham They have you had any of those if you ever get a chance to buy one of those I think it was uh twenty dollars for uh I don't remember how many pounds it was But you cook it in the bag that they send it in And all the juices and everything are all sealed in And I tell you what it's never failed to come out tender and juicy and just delicious Because I normally don't like ham because it's so salty But with this honey bake that they have that's the only one I have been able to find there at Sam's warehouse It is absolutely delicious And it slices great Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Wow You know that sounds like it But that's the only ham I have found that I thoroughly thoroughly enjoy Wow Uh-huh Right Right That's true I don't think so anymore not with more becoming more conscious of uh fat and cholesterol and all those good things Oh yeah Well my parents actually started it and uh getting Well it's true I think my parents are very unusual because uh we grew up in the south where uh you have all the uh you know biscuits and gravy and oh fried foods galore And then gradually they started switching over to uh plain rice uh no gravy it really is they actually uh uh led us through it versus uh us teaching them you know uh the finer points But my mother has really high cholesterol so it was one of the reasons which started them off And they started doing this like or in about the middle seventies Uh yeah It's true it's true I agree with you So it's really neat Uh-huh Uh-huh That's right Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Wow Uh-huh Uh-huh Wow Huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Wow that's good Uh-huh
