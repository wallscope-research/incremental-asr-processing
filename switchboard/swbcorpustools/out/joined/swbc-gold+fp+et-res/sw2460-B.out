Well what are the others Well it's helpful Well do you keep up with the statistical stuff Well there's a guy that was on show that I listen to going to work in the morning who does uh uh it's essentially trivial statistics but they've got a st- it's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games And apparently the Rangers last year won a lot of one run games Well it is but it's a reverse indicator Well what the argument is and it's one of these statistical gee how can you draw a conclusion from it but they find that there's a connection between that and how they do in Spring training the following year And uh strangely enough it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year Which means that if you have a good year winning one run games that the following year you'll have a bad year And um they've looked at I think twenty-three teams uh and the uh statistics are something like twenty-one out of twenty-three It was which means the Rangers are going to have a terrible year I uh Well I mean and it's uh uh I don't know what do you think of Incaviglia's loss Well it's an interesting concept though when you look at uh of how apparently I was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going to sign him uh and the point of I guess I don't understand the strategy of how baseball works but it seems that you know they can sign him tomorrow and he could go in the team the next day and they put him in the lineup and he hits a home run and all of a sudden he becomes a hero and all he has to do is hit the ball I mean you're not a- and all he has to do is one you know hit it once It doesn't he can swing a couple times if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can It's uh an interesting concept of how they do it But I agree with you I think that's part of what uh baseball needs more of I guess what bothers me is that when you go um you wait and wait and wait and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run and that's all the game is I'd rather see the ball hit around and have the people Yes Yeah well how do you think the Royals are going to do Well are they going to beat Oakland Yeah Well I go to Saint Louis from time to time and I watch their sports up there and uh they're certainly intense about the Cardinals they did you actually live in Saint Louis everybody does right I had a friend from college that lives in uh it's well I should say on the west side I mean everything's on the west side Manchester Uh out that way and I went and visited him but anyway it is interesting Well how are the Cardinals Do you still keep up with them or someth- Well is that a good indicator You know what I think is remarkable is uh it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have real breakthrough years and the question is how do you forecast that if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series I mean it would be really tough Yeah Yeah well when are the Rangers going to come through th- Well is there enough money that's part of it I uh that was part of Skip Bayless' argument I don't know if you read Skip Bayless a local commentary and his argument is that uh the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to bring in the big dollars would you agree with that Uh Yeah Well didn't Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff Yeah Well and I think that's maybe part of it that the um and it you know if I owned the team I think you'd like them to do well but the question of losing big money that what did Steinbrenner actually make money on the Well yeah it's a little bit like any other sport you know When it starts costing you fifty or a hundred dollars to go to a game and uh you know I mean I guess as we get older you're probably going if you compare to go to a sport a say you go to a rock concert or even a performance an opera or the symphony or something uh if you know i- but how often do you do that An I would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there you know several times a Yeah Yeah but don't you think there are older fans there I don't mean older um you know the fact that it's a better established and that the city is more of a
