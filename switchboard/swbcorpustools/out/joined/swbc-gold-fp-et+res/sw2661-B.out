So eating out What are you interested in in restaurants once a week twice a week Yeah I understand but we both work and we have a daughter and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway really I'm kind of open on food I'm what you might call a culinary adventurer I'll try anything once Been on a real barbecue kick lately Yeah yeah we usually have Chinese once a month I hate franchised restaurants I despise franchised restaurants I I I always prefer to go to something that seems more family run some place where you seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost I don't but I don't like something fake or put on either You know if I could have a good small restaurant or a good large restaurant I'd go to the good small restaurant And I don't know why that is I think it's probably due to pricing often Well yeah yeah Yeah It is what you look for isn't isn't I try to get my money's worth And not just that I try to well that's a big part of it I try to get my money's worth You know and not just in quantity you know but quality and and flavor and texture and care Well presentation's not always all of it either It's it's important Uh-huh Yeah yeah something a little extra and just for color if nothing else Yeah yeah What I miss up here is I'm originally a Texan and I miss home cooked Mexican Yeah home cooked Tex-Mex Mexican restaurants where it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation Yeah Well there's real Mexican food and there's real Tex-Mex Mexican you know by third or fourth generation Americans of Hispanic heritage yes and and there's big differences of course and of course when you talk about Mexican cuisine you that's kind of like talking about American food or Chinese food <> because <> its regional too So Oh yeah that's the way it is here in Colorado also No fresh or almost no fresh seafood and in Texas we got it from the Gulf And yeah here a couple years ago my wife and I went to Seattle on vacation <> And I think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week And it was <> I was like a man starving at every meal It's a lot cheaper there isn't it Lobster It's like shrimp on the Gulf Two ninety-eight a pound That's as cheap as steaks some places in a grocery store my gosh I've got to go to Maine then <> You may have sold a trip for some time it sounds wonderful so That sound good down in the Gulf I've eaten a bunch of those little <> seafood shacks we've called them And it's just so much different than to eat something that's been frozen You know <> shrimp straight out of the bay Hm Was it true Hm Huh yes the cajuns They can they can do things to shrimp that that no one else can So have you eaten crawfish yet as with anything it's preparation  Uh-huh It there's all kinds So you do eat out a lot One of our other real problems with going out to eat Sunday morning brunches You know Sunday brunch all all you can eat brunches we still find it fun Well I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor And so Yeah actually one of our one of our favorites is a chain Shoney's Yeah <> in spite of the fact I've spoken so badly about chains chain restaurants we { F uh } do like Shoney's pretty well but then there's a place up the pass up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings drive drive up to I think it's about eight thousand foot elevation And and drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast It it it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning I think it's as much the the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch {D You know } and it's not that far It's thirty miles Colorado Springs West west out of Colorado Springs
