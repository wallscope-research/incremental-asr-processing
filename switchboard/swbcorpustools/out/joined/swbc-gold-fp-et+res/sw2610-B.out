I like it I I I have a foreign actually I have more than one foreign automobile And I I I find the I find the the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters I was trying to build a shed and they give you these measurements like forty-two and three eighths inches and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths Well no What we did was wind up using and you just go you just go down and and you get out the the so many inches and and we just marked a little bit less than that which is somewhat awkward but had it been millimeters you could have done I think what's interesting the way engineering people do is they they in essence have gotten around it by by listing decimal inches Do you- are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that Well have have you do you are you involved in any other metric type things like I think it's interesting you we- you know when yo- you go out there and you're looking for a wrench and you want the next size larger I've got I inherited some some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds Well now that one's fairly easy because that's probably slightly under half an inch But some of them like like twenty-seven and and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that that don't translate Yeah and and you've got to go over there and try it and I suppose you know I need a larger one I need a smaller one obviously you can look at it and say well anyway I think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't I don't know do you do you drink adult beverages We- th- have you noticed that that a lot of the a lot of Yes It's like a fifth like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange What's a fifth of whiskey It was a marketing ploy Yeah But the idea was is that by with five fifths they could they could they could sell five and and it was simply a ploy to to get people you know to buy to buy more for it's I find that interesting But it's like you know the the the the soda and this kind of things coming in on- one liter bottles and I I think it's kind of generational Although I must admit that that I am not I ca- I'm not conversant in saying you know that's three centimeters away or or or Yeah  Yeah It's it's hard to think though It's like a mill you know We we do well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill co- bond wire on on semiconductor devices And well what's a mill and Yeah Don't you find that interesting that they that that they're doing that in any field for ho- why why why pieces could you could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't okay The bolts were were Eng- were were English then Now that's strange Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Essentially they do that though because if if you look at General Motors the size and and and of course Ford and Chrysler If they all went if they all went metric but in a sense you know it's like when yo- a measurement though when when you put you know one point four three two inches whe- when you're milling something you simply set your equipment or or you measu- or you got your calipers there and and you measure you know you mic it to see if it's accurate and No Yeah Yeah You get you a pair of metric pliers right And you beat on it and a metric hammer I think I don't think so I I think that th- I think they've now just taken the attitude that well if it happens if it because it there a lot of things that that like sports you know It's a hundred meter And but automobile races if it I don't think they'd ever it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred They're not going to Yeah And and it I I don't think it I don't you know I don't think I don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality you it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold How many ounces of gold you know I was trying I was trying to figure up gold content on something It had has gold plated header And and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce Yeah Now that makes you know Well and and then there's a metric ton and then there's a ton But what's a metric ton I don't know Yeah And and then but then the medicine And and some of these other things and and the chemistry in those kinds of areas milliliter Yeah And and so but but when you go to order a drink you know say they they I don't know it's I don't know And and but you know when you go to the store and and you're trying to figure you know well this box is is is is twelve ounces and and this one's three pounds and you That's right And and I don't know I I think that I I think I think the Federal government is going to more or less leave it alone I think they've got I think there are more pressing problems Yes Yeah But but are are the tools that if you're cutting are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for tha- for set up  So you've got thousands of dollars or so I mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools Yes But I was thinking about though that that when you actually get to the milling equipment though when it starts turning Yeah But whe- you when you when you simply drilling a hole a real simple thing like gee I need a hole there Yeah Yeah And and what but the thing is then you've got to with screws and that's the other issue the pitch and
