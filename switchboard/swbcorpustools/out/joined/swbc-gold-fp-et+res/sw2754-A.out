Okay Yeah Uh-huh I believe in it too I'm Catholic and we're not supposed to but I feel that it like you you know on the premeditated murders I feel if you're you know if it's beyond a doubt that you did it you know I would say go ahead and execute that person as well But it's the cases you know like sometimes you you know you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely you know they really didn't do it Well you know you you got you got that point well h- you know what what if a mistake is made and you put someone you know to death that really didn't do it There's always that chance I don't know but I would say that you know for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated it would be kind of hard for you know You know what I'm saying Like Yeah So I Uh-huh Exactly I'm not sure about Pennsylvania whether we have it or not For some reason I was thinking that we do but it's you know it's not very often I think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that that anyone anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it I don't do you know if Virginia has it Uh-huh I know Florida has it Uh-huh Yeah you know Yeah But it's funny that like you know like I said I think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania I'm not even sure of that but for some reason I think that you know it was something like that And it surprised and even Florida I know they have it and you don't really hear about it real often how many people Yeah but you you think that if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed you know compared to that and to how many people are being sent that doesn't seem like very many Yeah Everyone would appeal That's true too Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah uh-huh And then they get out Yeah they get out in three years on probation and they do it again you know It's like a slap on the fingers for them I don't I don't e- e- I don't I think that it should be if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone a murder then I think you know that they should likewise you know someone should take their life also But but are are you would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I think some of them would rather be in jail Yeah They probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets I don't know I was just going to say something I forgot what it was <> I don't even remember what it was now In Clarion Well I live in Butler but I'm at c- I'm at college I'm at Clarion University Yeah Uh-huh See yeah okay well see I'm I'm in kind I'm in kind okay we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus Yeah and that would be pushing it So this is definitely a college town we're about two hours north of Pittsburgh if that would help you out any North of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania I've never heard of Polk but I never heard of that It might have a new name Yeah yeah We're probably about an hour away from Sharon Uh-huh so I most of the kids here I you know like you know just from dorm mates and stuff they'll say that they don't believe in it but then after I would say my point of view then they'll say well yeah you know da- you know Yeah You know I think people can be persuaded one way or another I've never seriously ran into someone like other than my priest you know who definitely says you can't take a you know you can't take anyone's life anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance Uh-huh Exac- yeah Uh-huh Yeah but you know I look at that and say well they should have thought about that beforehand You know Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah That's something you know but wh- whether they plea bargain or not if they're guilty of murder they're guilty of murder you know So I don't think that they deserve anything less It's just I don't I don't know I just Uh-huh and that costs money yeah Uh-huh Yeah
