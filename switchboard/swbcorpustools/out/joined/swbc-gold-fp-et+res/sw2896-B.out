Well I have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting And it's a rent house and I decided it's too expensive to rewallpaper so I decided I'm going to paint And I've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint And I'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them Either that or maybe rag rolling To give it kind of a country look Yeah one of the books that I bought where it's d- describing the sponge painting said you can like layer different colors and Uh-huh Ugh Yeah what I what I'm trying to do is I've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms so I want something that's going to tie that together and I'm changing the like the towel racks and stuff the the fixtures out to make them wood I'm going to put wood in there So it's going to have kind of a country look and I haven't even decided as far as what kind of paint to buy I don't have an actual instruction book so I'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now it's going to be a big experiment Yeah Yeah yeah Yeah I've Uh-huh inside What what kind of what kind of paint do you normally use Okay uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well we only have on- only one of our bathroom has a window in it so I'm hoping that it won't be too much of a a problem I'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first Because I I think No I'm I'm planning on taking it off  Okay Well that's something that that's worthwhile checking into then 'Cause I It it's hard to tell it's the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style And I know the house was built around the mid fifties So it may be the original wallpaper in one bathroom it's it's probably paper it's silver silver and yellow and white that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom Really Well I I've also been thinking about after looking at all these magazines these design magazines and stuff I'm thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too in a color that will kind of tie in our our our comforter with a color that's kind of a burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design and I'm not really quite sure I don't know if maybe I'm biting off more than I can chew Yeah well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting It wouldn't be any kind of special special effects type thing It would be just plain paint okay Uh-huh  It it peels the paint off when you take it off yeah Yeah okay Yeah really okay  Okay Well I really appreciate all the helpful tips I think you are just made my project a lot easier If you were if you were closer I'd I'd I'd tell you you could come over and supervise Well we'll see how it goes I may just be flat painting over it Yeah Yeah I I need to go to the dentist so It's was nice talking to you Kathleen Bye-bye
