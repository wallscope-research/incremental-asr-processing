you hit you hit it doesn't matter we're discussing the capital punishment I believe which I am am pro capital punishment except that I don't like the way it's done Uh-huh I I agree I I'm capital the the capital punishment is necessary in in many cases but the it's not a deterrent or our jails would not be so full There wouldn't be so many people in Death Row I think it needs to be something a throwback to where they did a public execution where it's visible something you know not gruesome but but something more where people know that it it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people If you committed a certain crime you were going to receive a death penalty and it was going to happen to you No stays of execution No no loopholes no Notoriety Ye- yes but but they they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal They know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years That they are going to write a book They are going to go on talk shows they're goin- that that that's a reward for a heinous crime rather than having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life In in complete of any notoriety Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Well yes they will It  well that's correct yes Ye- if if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is it is executed Yeah But but the the the chances are not great that that will happen But there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years Uh-huh Uh-huh That's right Yes Why you know y- y- you could carry it to that if if they are a repeat offender and and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this Unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes and of course of battery or assault or that is not a capital crime see You you wouldn't be able to under our system Now China and a few other countries have a little different view of that you get caught with dope there and you die period There is there is no no appeals There is no
