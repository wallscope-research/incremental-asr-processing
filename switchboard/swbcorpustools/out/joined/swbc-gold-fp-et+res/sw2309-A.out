Okay have you ever served as a juror Uh-huh I never have either Well I think it's a good idea I think our justice system needs a major overhaul and I'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it But I think they've got a lot of problems True Yeah I think that's true Yeah Do would you prefer all trials by a judge Yeah I would agree with that I think you're righ- I think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company and Uh-huh If they give them all the information I don't know when it comes to sentencing phase I guess they tell them if a guy if the person has a previous record and stuff Sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury's not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave and the judge decides whether or not they should hear it Right Yeah Do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Some of them disagree some of them said one way and some the other I think it does have to be unanimous I know they can poll a jury make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was but I thought that they all had to agree or else they it was a hung jury And Yeah I thi- I don't know how I feel about that I think maybe majority might be sufficient It's hard to say though Oh Yeah I hadn't thought about international trials at all Right Yeah Yeah Yeah I think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street for something like that because of the cultural differences Things like that Yeah What about uniform sentencing Right Yeah like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years It's not a discretionary thing Uh-huh Yeah I wish that when they sentence someone if they're going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years Yeah I Yeah and sometimes those people are are young enough they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble Yeah I don't believe that very often happens I don't think so either In fact I think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad Yeah I think I think maybe they ought to just be punished with some some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know Actually make them do something that's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them and Yeah Yeah Something besides license plates and tiddlywinks Yeah Yeah Well I think that covers it Nice talking to you Bye You too Bye
