Okay what do you usually wear to work Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I work at T I and they don't really have dress code so to speak there It's pretty lax about you know we- you can pretty much wear whatever you want to and I wear anything from jeans when I'm feeling really casual to suits and dresses when I'm meeting with a customer or I I teach training classes need slash and so when I'm teaching a class obviously I wear a suit or dress sd so slash error It it definitely fluctuates mainly with what I'm going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is and when it's raining I'm more likely to wear jeans and and when it's really cold I'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or that type of thing but it just really depends on the weather and my mood and then you know obviously when I'm doing anything that I'm in front of people or or making presentations teaching whatever I'm going to dress up more Uh-huh Uh-huh There are a few people every now and then that wear those to work There pretty strict about that though I've never worn I just wouldn't even to well jeans aren't exactly professional but for some reason a mini skirt is to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans just because it's maybe it's just because of the sexist views and everything but you just feel like you're you're being showing too much le- I don't know I wouldn't want to wear a mini skirt to work I have seen a few people do it though but they they weren't overly shor- and they weren't overly revealing They were pretty much in good taste but for me I just I just cou- wouldn't want to do that Yeah Uh-huh that's what I've seen Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Well I feel like too on the job when you know there's men around and some of the managers are men you just you know you don't want them looking at your legs necessarily And to me I just wouldn't feel comfortable in that at work but Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Even with the very tailored look of a suit sometimes I like to have someth- a lit- just a little something that's feminine Not you know you don't want to over do it but just a little a touch of it just to say yes I am a woman but I can be professional too Right uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right that's what I one thing I like about T I is that they aren't overly strict about what you wear and they don't you know your boss doesn't come up to you and say now remember tomorrow you have a meeting so you'd better wear a suit they they leave it up to you and your judgment to to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have The only real restrictions they have are no halter tops and no shorts even the long walking short of the squirts the the split skirts anything that that could be considered shorts they don't allow And they don't allow any sweat any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar or you know anything like that on it but other than that it's pretty pretty lax and I think that's good because it does allow people to be individual and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day Or you know if you want to be comfortable and casual you can and sometimes I think you may be more productive if you're comfortable with what your wearing and can be be feel more relaxed slash needed Whereas sometimes when your in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and you're not you know maybe you don't can't get as comfortable to sit down sv and you know like when I'm writing training material I prefer to be more comfortable unless I know I have to meet with a customer later during the day So that's I think that is good that they're like that I do know there's a lot of companies that are very strict about what the employees wear and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and you know no variation and I don't I don't quite agree with that Right right Yeah Uh-huh Right I agree Well it I guess we've talked probably long enough Nice talking to you too I enjoyed it Bye bye
