Yeah and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or state school Okay but you're excluding high-level education Okay Yeah I know down here the school's are you know I don't know they rate I moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can understand why Because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don't know what's going on Right Well that was my experience going through junior high up there when I came down south for high school I was just repeating what I'd already done Because we were so far advanced And you know I'd been in a parochial school before junior high and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools So you know I I like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education you know you you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier and then you you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over Well they talk about it and there are a few in some of the more like in I live in a big Metroplex and some of the the better parts of the Metroplex the the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools But you know Right Or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art You know there's no point in you know I'm an engineering student and if I have to go take art classes you know I'm not going to use them And through high school I could have gone so much further if I'd gone to a school that was directed Right in high school Right I think the schools today you know the public schools are just they're just overrun you know they don't know what to do there's too many kids and not enough teachers and too many of the kids don't care And Right Yeah and you know there's some kids that you know want to go learn but most of them just want to go play Yeah that's true I'm wondering with the boom down here It's well not at the moment but a lot of the industry's moving southward So I don't know about that but a lot of the industry up in you know the northern states is moving south and I'm wondering if that's going to have any effect you know on what you see now We're we're we're behind down here I say we because I live here If that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years Yeah Right You hope I guess you just have to wonder is it up to the is it you know who whose supposed to make the change the the state the govern- the federal government you know where's the money supposed to come from Is it you know what what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got Yeah Yeah Starts hitting closer to home Yeah they're a lot more strict You have to learn you aren't given the chance to you know screw off all the time Well I know I'm in the you know the only reason I asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the University of Texas the education I'm getting I think is kind of shoddy for a public school I I don't think I'm getting what I should but you know in Texas it's next to free because th- they pay so much of it It's state supported But at the same time it's really not it's not like going to M I T My engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of M I T And that's it's really too bad but that's I don't know I think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built You get people out of high schools and col- junior colleges that don't have the background for an M I T kind of curriculum So
