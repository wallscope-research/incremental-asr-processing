What I couldn't hear you I'm doing fine I'm just editing a spreadsheet right now I'm trying to figure out how I can retire without having to work until I'm ninety-five Yeah This is a very appropriate topic for our conversation today because what I'm figuring out is that I'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what I'm making What is that Well we've got a pretty good situation my wife and I since our property is already paid for You know the main things that I like about the <> the job benefits would be the the availability of the health insurance and the availability of you know being able to transfer around inside the organization without having you know when they cut off a system and they don't just can everybody that is working on it like some companies I know of You know they give you an opportunity to either transfer into an on going on going project Yeah What Huh-uh Huh-uh Yeah that's something I hadn't really thought about because we don't have children But I can see how it would be a a real benefit Yes I do  Well that could be I could see where that would be important No I don't know what it's about okay Yeah yeah we got that Pretax insurance Yeah Um it's probably what the first guy who did it called it Yeah He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it I'll tell you what we could do We could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money You know do a little bit better research on who gets hired Because you know Well not only just health insurance for the whole benefit of the company See I look at it this way If the company folds I got to go find a job Okay Now if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs just about anybody in the company and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job then we should find A a place to put them or B you know boot them out Well frankly I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid What Oh I'm I'm I know Well there's two schools of thought on that You know I I'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a a professor I got about eight years of education ahead of me before I can do that but once you get that job with the university you've got ten years of probation Then you have tenure And they can't fire you Well you know in a situation like that I don't know if that's good or bad I do know that I've had tenured professors that were just sorry And I've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs But in addition Well they they really can't fire you without cause you know the governments taken care of that but what I'm looking at is you know there are a lot of teachers that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors You know and I could see a point protecting someone's position but on the other hand I don't think it you know that someone that teaches say shop for instance should have to have degree at all Well In some places that don't But you know you you get specialized education now for instance take computer science We've got kids twenty years old right now that could beat any computer professor at micro computer applications I know we could And these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches because there's no comprehensive test that they can take that would allow them to to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college You know I went to college late on in life and I realize that hey it's nothing but four years of endurance and you might be teachable you know what I mean my agree is absolutely worthless listen; agree is probably degree It's my experience and and my knowledge that that is beneficial but then you know like I said I came in backwards Industrial Marketing Well actually I'm selling computer software But the two are mutually exclusive Because the the experience that got me the job that I got now was my experience in the construction field prior to going to college not my degree which is I think kind of bizarre Well We've we've we've already got that Well yeah Supervisor evaluations have always been a tough one Especially in my line because you know my supervisor has nothing to with my job except to make sure I get my check Well not really You know there's what's to evaluate about him you know my my supervisor level is like practically zero I run the whole show And when I need something I tell my boss and he gets it for me because he knows that I know what I'm doing You know and that that is something that I think needs to be expanded on specially in the large market place You know the major corporation because so often you know you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak You know it's it's hard for me to you know especially since I'm in marketing sales you know I make more than my boss Because he's salary and I'm not I make as much as I earn You know if I don't make a sale I don't make anything Yeah Well it's tough but you know there are requirements and quotas what not for me to make but the bottom line on on that kind of thing is you know we have a lot of people especially in major corporations who aren't doing a damn thing They're just there You know the work they do could be totally eliminated and not that they aren't worth or not that they aren't trying or anything But it's just that their jobs are useless Take for instance a large construction company I used to work for Ed Swampers Swampers is a guy who's in the union He's a laborer And he's assigned to
