we live in a one story just like a style home you know the standard Texas Fox and Jacobs How about you guys Are you in a ho- apartment or a home Well they say those are easy to fi- difficult to find How are rents doing I haven't looked at rents in a long time Uh-huh What's a what's a one bedroom are you in a well Plano most most complexes in Plano are pretty nice so you're probably in a you know Uh-huh that does get high yeah  Yeah I was going to say our mortgage is is between depending on you know it drops seems like in the last six months we got lucky and we refinanced and it but it was like eight hundred and something but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty so that's really not I have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a town house in yeah in actually they're near Plano in North Dallas too but I couldn't believe it but you know Yeah And then I think that nobody was really buying houses there for a long time there because of just we've been in ours for about ten years but there's no investment in it you know all it allows you to do is itemize on your on your taxes yeah that's really about it it's have you ever owned your own home So you know what it's like yeah it's like when you first this is our third one it's not and it's not that exciting after a while Yeah suburban tract yeah we we lived out of state for a while and came back and we lived in a smaller city and now we say Gee Dallas really is big and polluted Uh-huh Yeah it's really it's really sad because they're not doing anything well we're getting off the subject I guess/ but just like with housing they're not doing anything about pollution they're not doing anything about it's going to look like have you ever been to Houston You know I used to think that Dallas was better than Houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a now it looks just like Houston to me We've been in here ten years Yeah so we've got you know got some investment in it but you really don't get anything out of it Yeah smaller we were up in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania My home town The prices actually a lot better because Pittsburgh is about the size I've been trying to think like a Louisville or Minneapolis that type of size And the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy-five eighty Yeah it's really and we didn't think it was that clean but then after you're gone for a while it looks cleaner you know  Yeah Saint Louis whatever Really I guess it's yeah but and here I guess it depends on what you want you know here I got a lot of people that work for J C Penney in marketing and a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you're talking about they had no they had a lot of property but not a lot of house and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it but but they love it they they they think they're getting you know you say sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell it Yeah Yeah and a lot of them I know a couple women that work there and they don't miss in Public Relations and they don't miss having a basement to run up and down to you know And I said You haven't heard about tornados How about those you know Uh-huh Yep That's exactly growing I grew up in western Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh and we used to call the basements actual cellars so it's funny to hear that word because I never hear it you know it's like the back porch used to be a stoop you know but the housing is just we like the older houses and I don't know if we're going to stay here or not depends you know Pardon me Yeah actually when we were up north but some family things changed so we ended up come back down here and all that because it helped my husband's work but we really would like to but we don't know if we're going to do it unless we stay here you know Yeah it's real tough the economy any more I think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything you know it's Pardon me Yes I do No we don't how do we take care of the house Well I don't have a Mexi- I don't shouldn't say that I don't have an ethnic maid I don't have we have some friends that live near North Dallas off of Campbell Road and they have like a four thousand square foot home and she's got a a live out nanny but any rate I don't have any of that I don't know it's really not too difficult with no children and just two people you know We have a Yeah we have a dog and we're pretty we're not fanatically neat but we keep things up you know not like where there is three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring no we're pretty much we we've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wall paper together and things like that we pretty much hire we subcontract mostly everything other than anything that's not a I know how to fix a running toilet he does what he needs to but mostly if it's something major you know cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that Yeah no thanks I Have you ever done that you sound like you may have been a couple one time built = been And how'd that go Uh-huh Getting to agree to things I'm sure and I also think that once you get to be you know certain when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older you start the dollar value on things I you know I think people that own homes a lot in North Dallas are very materialistic I know I'm supposed to talk about homes but people that the people that own them are the hom- homes themselves and you know spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies for custom drapes just doesn't Yeah that's and and you know you see a lot of these people that came east from west from from New York with Exxon or J C Penney and it's just a hoot to watch them Right right exactly so well was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house my goodness yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well in a way you can travel light How is how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that Uh-huh Yes I do Everybody pretty much kee- keeps- keeps to their own turf so to speak Yeah Uh-huh Relax and try to go to sleep really yeah I think Plano in general is getting a little more well it's gotten so big it's almost a town in it's own right Or something yeah the price of home now we paid we paid about seventy-eight nine for our house like I said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago and I'd say they appraised it it's gone up you now maybe like five percent so it's an investment but it's something that you know when you're first married or starting out you think if you really have something but you really it's just real nowadays with the way the income tax I think housing is strictly to itemize Yeah exactly we Yeah and even you know like we had I called them prefabs just a tract home you know we we had one of their homes that was nicer in Pennsylvania but it was an older home but then you buy an older home and you're always fixing things up So you know
