Okay The latest movie I've seen that I thought was fantastic was DANCES WITH WOLVES man <> I I just finally ended up going to see it and one day my husband had the kids and I just went because we couldn't we could never get to go see it together because it's so long By the time we had a babysitter for that long So I finally just went to see it And I just thought it was fantastic Yeah Yeah That was quite a <> the buffalo scene in that thing was so real It's like it just blew me away Yeah I'm I'm afraid to go see that one That one looks so scary just from the previews I thought gosh I'd probably have nightmares for the next six months It's supposed to be good though I know some friends who went to see it They said it was really riveting Well you're not a thirteen year old I don't know I saw it when I was a kid and I thought man uh-huh really Gosh boy Gosh Call the crisis line Yeah I bet gosh I saw one I thought was crummy With that new Michael J Fox movie THE HARD WAY Where he plays a a actor that's like th- I know It was well I ended up at the theater and there was didn't seem to be anything else on I wanted to see so I'll try that But it wasn't worth anything I didn't care for that at all Yeah Well the last two I saw him in one of those BACK TO THE FUTURE PART THREE deals and that was crummy also I didn't think that was any good so Yeah boy Yeah Yeah Well I hadn't read it and I couldn't figure what was going on half the time so Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah I should probably go back and read the book now that I just saw the movie again not too long ago Wow Well I have one I bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids OTIS AND MILO that is that is the most precious movie It has w- to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life And it's all this it's the story of this little cat and dog and it's not like cutesy It's just it's just so realistic Everything they do You wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things And it was A real dog and cat and all the other animals They initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised And then the cat gets on this treacherous journey He climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river and he winds up all over creation I don't know where in the world it is Somewhere in China somewhere I think that it was filmed But it's just really an incredible thing Yeah It was pretty wild and Of course the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it But there's no you know nothing else to keep it going But it really keeps keeps me going I I've seen it twice now  Yeah It was like the best of the Walt Disney ones Walt Disney's kind of gotten worse in my opinion over the past few years Yeah Yeah All those old good ones that you you know wish they had on more now but boy  That's pretty good Really Let's see What are some other ones I've seen lately I'm trying to remember I can't I just saw one on the video have you seen THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY PART TWO That is a riot Yeah The first one was really good But the second one is really good too I was really surprised No I thought it was funny But that's my sense of humor It's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore And I'm just I guess I'm just middle America or something I just go to be entertained and and not really interested in some of the like the TERMINATOR or some of the Schwarzenegger stuff I just Yeah FREDDY'S REVENGE PART TWENTY-FIVE or whatever Yeah I've never Yeah Yeah I've never seen any of those Yeah I can't either He seems so macho I just Yeah Yeah Yeah When they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can You don't That's like my husband does that He can watch them over and over And I'm there's very few I would want to see that many times So he he once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over yeah That was a good one I haven't seen that one in a long time Yeah boy Uh-huh gosh  Yeah I bet Gosh boy So that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that really Well when I was in England years ago And I went to to like Shakespeare's and you know Stratford-On-Avon and all that and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it because it was so short The ceilings were so short But Yeah Yeah boy Yeah Yeah yeah Did you see any movies over there I remember I went to see DON QUIXOTE over there when it came out It came out right around the time with Sophia Loren and that was a riot to see that Yeah Cause when you're touristing you probably don't want to take the time to go see a movie  boy Uh-huh boy Yeah That sounds great Yeah Yeah Uh-huh boy Probably some of them did Yeah Yeah It's hard to know what the good movies are anymore Because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by Yeah I see It's kind of like waterfront property or something if you're you know if you're two miles away from water Water view Yeah Uh-huh
