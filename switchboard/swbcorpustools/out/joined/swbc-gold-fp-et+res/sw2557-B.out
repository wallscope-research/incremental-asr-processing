well that will be nice though But still sort of up in that general area of the country so you can probably see them sometimes Yeah Yeah Okay Well what kind of recycling do you have in your area Uh-huh what which one is that uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Yeah Sure On just particular things or Uh-huh Well it sounds like they're doing quite a bit  Yeah Uh-huh Right Well our company does some things all of which I couldn't even tell you about I don't know all of them but Texas Instruments Yeah Well I I was just curious as how you got hooked up with this this speech type of thing Oh and he Yeah Well here at work each one of us has two trash baskets in our office and one of those is designed for any kind of paper products that they want to use you know for recycling They can't deal with every type Well I guess I don't know specifically except that for the paper that they want to recycle they do not want any newspaper and things like candy wrappers or that type of thing Let's see I have a list here they don't want lunch sacks or brown envelopes phone books So there are you know a lot of kinds of things that they don't want but then any kind of computer paper letters booklets they'll even take things that are bound and it doesn't all have to be like white They'll take colored folders and and even some of those can have plastic tabs on them So it's it's hard to kind of figure out you know which things are the right ones I I'll frequently have to look at the list if it's something that I don't throw away all the time But they do that and then we use different chemicals and things and I know that about how they take care of that sort of thing I I don't know all the details but they're really on top of that And there probably some other things that I don't about because we're a real large company And I just don't have contact with them But in our city well I live in a suburb of Dallas and they have initiated a newspaper recycling whereby they pick it up from your alley one day a week and all you have to do is bundle it all around Dallas there are a lot of recycling centers where you can take things sometimes for money but most of those are real far away from like where I live at any rate Very inconvenient and it's just you know hasn't been very practical to get into a lot of those things If they would make it something where they you know would pick it up at the curb or at least make it you know down the street and at the corner type of thing Yeah that wouldn't be so bad our grocery store like yours will take the plastic bags and they'll also take the the paper bags back But you mentioned the glass type of stuff The reason I ask you about that is years ago and it it changed names somewhere along the line but my dad used to work for Knox Glass in Knox Pennsylvania really Yeah it's Yeah they were taken over by Glass Containers years ago and but he worked for them for like thirty-one years And he used to travel up there to Knox quite a bit and and I even did once when I was a child you know so really Yeah we I was looking through our photo album not long ago and they had had some pictures and things in there of Knox But I guess that's about it you know as far as what goes on that I know about  Yeah Yeah that's Uh-huh Well I think probably more people you know would participate if they just made it a little easier and like you say make it better for companies to do these things and get involved in it without huge cost to them because obviously no one wants to spend a lot of money just to deal with trash you know Yeah that's true That's right Uh-huh That's true Uh-huh Also probably look at packaging and that sort of thing We don't we don't need three quarters of what we get I that's their marketing Well Yeah I I'm guess our city you know in picking them up must take them somewhere else and get something for them But I don't that it's a big money
