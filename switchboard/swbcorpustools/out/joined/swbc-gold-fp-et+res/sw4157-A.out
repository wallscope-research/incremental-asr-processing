Um so what do you think Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Oh really Huh Uh-huh Uh-huh  Huh Right Right  Yeah I- that is uh that is something I've heard Uh I had a friend uh that I worked with that was from Sweden and that was uh probably the the major concern I have is that you know we are leading in the technology realm of of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to to get into uh the medical field but at the same time it's real hard I mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance and so you know I'm real you know it's like well you know you know there's got to be better ways you know to do some things but you know I hate to uh the the competition i- in a lot of ways is is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor and and uh they have to compete to be to be good and to be knowledgeable But at the same time there's a you know they're regulating themselves and and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don't have to pay very much for My I have a brother who's a vet and for something that he can get you know wholesale and I'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they they hospitals buy in such a bulk rate um you know they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item and that's ridiculous And I don't think that is that is uh abnormal in any means to be doing things like that And I don't think it's abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all I- yeah And so i- i- it's I think i- to me I think uh something that's going to help our medical uh arena is for um and I don't know how to I don't know how to do this but I think people are too lawsuit happy And I mean things will happen and and you've got to uh keep up or you've got to realize that you know i- it is just men or women that are that are making um decisions and they will make mistakes and e- e- you know i- if people you know i- there are some people that I'm sure make mistakes because they just don't keep on top of it but there are other things that just happen that you can't you know you can't say you know well if you had just done this you know things would have done differently and um I don't know I I think the fact that malpractice has gone up I think has raised our prices just dramatically Um in the in the last number of years and I think that's something that if if they could work on the cause of that and
