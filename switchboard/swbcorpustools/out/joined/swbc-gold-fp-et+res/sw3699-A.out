Okay do you live in a home Uh-huh did you Uh-huh We've lived in ours for about six years We had it built actually And it's our first home too Yeah well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in and that was quite an experience I I much prefer having my own home and and just the space and and more privacy Yeah it's it's like twenty-four fifty square feet It's a two story Yeah How about yours Is it small really uh-huh Do you do you have children Just one  uh-huh Yeah yeah yeah Well like how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood uh-huh Yeah Yeah  Yeah it it it it does it it seems about probably average But our neighborhood has a just a wide variety of of people and you know there's older people here and and people that are our our age we're in our thirties And there's a lot of kids a lot of kids People across the street have eight Uh-huh Yeah their home just burned down matter of fact and last summer and they're just rebuilding and their house is going to be really big It's Yeah they're building a lot bigger He's not an obstetrician an an orthopedic surgeon And so since the house did burn they're they're going it's quite different than it was before and it's it's a lot bigger And but ours is about it's you know it's a nice home it's definitely not one of the the smaller ones and it's not the biggest either But  Yeah Yeah You You know that's interesting you say that because we do have we have those architectural codes here and when we put out house in they wanted us to have there was one we have part siding on on the two story part and then on the back and they there was one side where our chimney was and just the chimney was going to be brick and they wanted us to have more brick so we ended up having to go halfway up which it does look nicer and you know we would have like to have had all brick but of course at that point we couldn't afford it and but it's funny that you'd say that because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all So it's kind of like they were Yeah yeah and I and so it was kind of like it's they ours is the last street that they built on So the houses actually on our street are a little bit they're kind of gone a little bit nicer Yeah just they you know it's like the second phase and and so they've kind of changed the the codes a little bit and so that's kind of why I guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any uh-huh
