Okay I forgot all about that that it had to be pressed but anyway so so as far as w- + we really we don't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of T V because we both were raised you know that way you know where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a T V to be the baby-sitter And we just don't want that We want more communication and interaction you know amongst us as a family And we both like sports so we figured well what what better way to get out and you know be together as a family and also you know have it be good for you And plus we like we both like to cook so you know that's something we spend time together too is you know cooking and preparing meals and stuff So but as far as that that's about all we've discussed as far as for family my gosh yeah Yeah long way down the road right Yeah Uh-huh Well do you do you so  you go +  if you're if you're  not doing any kind of sport thing you go  to one of your sisters' or brothers' sporting events And sort of like be there with them Yeah Well that's that's good too as far as entering you're you're participating but you're not you know at least you're encouraging them on and stuff and that's because even if our kids you know get into sports that we're really not interested in I don't I want them you know to know that we're still there so to speak as a family Yeah Cheering you on and stuff Yeah well that that would be fun Boy so you you have a lot of experience as far as you know different ways a family can interact and and do things together as far as go- twelve But it's so if you're not i- what if do people go off in their own little groups with that many did like some people go to their rooms and Yeah  Yeah But when you were growing up and they weren't and the younger ones weren't around what did you do I see But now that they've all sort of moved off Yeah So do you think even what did you do when you were younger did you go do the board games and stuff you still did what you do now Uh-huh Hurling hurtle okay So you you had a lot of games and things you played even when you were kids with the ones that you Yeah Yeah no not real spread in age Yeah Gosh twelve is that is that pretty common up there in okay I don't meet I don't speak with many people that come from families that large any more my my husband's mother came from a family of thirteen but that's his mother you know and and their Catholic they're and that's Well that's it then I think probably maybe that that But do you see yourself having thirteen kids or twelve kids Yeah Yeah But it's so expensive man I would think for your parents it would be it would still be hard even nowadays just to raise twelve kids Would be shoosh Yeah Yeah Well sometimes I think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though you know you don't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody so you you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself if you really want it Uh-huh Yeah Or manage money or know yeah know you know how to get how to even go about getting money You know how to get a job or you know just what you know what when you get a job what your responsibility is Are you going to blow all that money how easy it is to blow money you earn Uh-huh Wow you've really got responsibilities Yeah Yeah Wh- So really I think sometimes there's an advantage sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent It makes you know that you can't take anything for granted that when you get something you're lucky to get it so to speak you know So I don't know sometimes but now it it is hard I can imagine on your parents you know
