Uh-huh That's okay That's okay it's more concentrated so they know where you are anyway I know here in here in Plano some of the things that we do are Kroger and some of the other stores too have said If you bring your bags back to to the store to recycle then they'll pay you a certain amount of money and that's one thing that started in the community Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah I know Kroger will do it and I think Albertson's does it sometimes I'm not sure and and yet I know that some of the stores will actually help the community not pay you the money back but will pay the the community like through the schools or things like that So that's always helpful and I know that we ha- we have the the can the can different can banks around the city that you can go to and do that one of the ways I don't know if this would be helpful It said on the the computer what do I think would be helpful And I don't know if it would be helpful or not but I know on Monday the the garbage men pick up like just any limbs or any extra trash that you might have And that might be an extra day to put out things that might be recycled if we had a a certain colored can to put them in or something in the city to put like either glass or newspapers or whatever Yeah Yeah Yeah I know getting a newspaper everyday I know I could just you know do that because I have to pick it up and it just goes out with our trash and I guess I'm not as recycling minded as I should be but that goes out with the trash and it really could be recycled Did you Tell me Don't you have to take like labels off of those jars Yeah Take them off yeah Soda both liter sodas can you do that Okay Right right I I know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just get it into different categories like that and I I don't know what it would take to to get my children to start working on it I have two older ones that probably would go along with the if I had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project you know Okay Yeah Uh-huh Oh
