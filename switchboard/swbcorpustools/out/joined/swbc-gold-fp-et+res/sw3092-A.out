Okay do you work outside the home Okay wow Have you Yes uh-huh Okay well yes I do In fact I am at work right now and so let me take the lead Angela I think what is really important of course salary is very important because that's why you are working for your for the money but job satisfaction to me is also very important in having a job And one of the things that she asked us to discuss was benefits I'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you Okay And so we could we could talk about that path you know how important you think his benefits are And and and how important you think they are and if what would you like to see increased in his benefits Like perhaps he has the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family and how much coverage it provides and also your hospital coverage and probably dental How important you think that would be Because they of course if you did not have them you would be pulling from your salary of course Right right And they always have surprises for you With children You know and so it's it is we could not do without the benefit package from from any company that we worked for whether they be a conglomerate or just a small business You would still have something Right Yes Uh-huh They are getting a handle on that in fact my oldest daughter is is a nurse and she just received her masters degree and she is now into consulting and that's one of the areas that she is working on To have a day care center for the indiv- the children of the of the nurses that are staffing the facility And that is true in many many areas of you know job titles and professions Uh-huh Sure Would it would It would be just futile And they would not have the quality And they would be deprived of their mother Yeah No I understand that totally I hear Yes that's true Right Uh-huh Yes Do you Do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting Do you think that would be acceptable I do too Right that you Right That's right With the company than than having to go That's that's right Yes I agree with that That would be fair Yeah and how how do you feel about let's see eye care Okay Vision I guess it's called vision care It depends on who ha- examines your eyes If you have an an optometrist or an ophthalmologist there's a vast difference in those two professionals Glaucoma Oh okay so Yes Uh-huh Yes they are Uh-huh Right that's critical because she's in need of it so often Yes and you know we have needs in our life that are unique to us and you know people have needs in their life that unique to us to them we are all different so Well no that's my other phone So that's it that's okay my that phone is ringing to an empty desk and she's on vacation so it's okay Uh-huh That's very expensive Yes that's true Orthodontic work is terribly expensive Especially when you have a lot of problems with the children teeth and and you have to really get them when they are young in order to have not a decent smile when they are fifteen sixteen years old I know two of my daughters had to have that and they started having extractions at age eight because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth And we footed the bill because there was not any such thing and when they were young uh-huh Uh-huh major Uh-huh Well I tell you I I just read an article in the paper about what they are doing I think it was an ad in in our publication at Texas Instruments where they are breaking the jaw and and lining the jaw up with the teeth It's it's less painful and less expensive Yeah I I know but it it's it's easier on the patient in the long run which amazed me
