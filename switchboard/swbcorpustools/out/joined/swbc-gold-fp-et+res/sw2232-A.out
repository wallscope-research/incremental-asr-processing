Okay So what are your opinions on it Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh N- not much I'm twenty-eight so No I really don't remember anything about it I guess I was about ten when it ended Right I was born in sixty-two so when did it end Yeah Because I was ten and I don't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in great detail No I didn't but I I did read the book I ha- do ha- I have six years of college so I did read and study about the Vietnam war though So I am pretty fa- you know I'm more familiar with it than Mine I think I think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that I think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to you know just leave their freedoms there and to you know get rid of some of the atrocities that were going to/ I don't I don't know I don't really I'm tired of pacifist though pacifist> pacifists see on the other hand I'm a pac- I'm really struggling with it Am I a pacifist physical pacifist I'm a Christian and I believe that the real warfare is not with Saddam Hussein or the North Vietnamese but it's in spiritual kingdoms and that the real warfare is done you know in your prayer closet on your knees So in a way in a sense I'm a pacifist but I'm really not You know what I'm saying I don't think just lay back and not do anything I think lets go to war lets> let's but let's go to war praying and let's go to war for that way so Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Still have a problem with you know I haven't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this but and I know other Christians would disagree with me My husband and I are kind of not even in agreement on this but we don't fight over it or anything but you know how can you know the Bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you and it's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind so it's like how can you I don't know for me I don't know you know I can't say that I agree with Vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and and then shoot them So Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah It is a difficult thing But then vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord/ and I will pay So I think God is ultimately in charge of what goes on and I know like now in China he did all these terrible things probably Mao and they were te- terrible and he was going to be accountable for them/ and but if you look back and you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads he put in all the temples he he unified the Chinese language It was impossible for missionaries to do accomplish anything in China because of all that and so even in North and South Vietnam I bet you'd see the same thing and that now he builds roads so then it and then he dropped dead twenty-five years premature he dropped dead and so something good did come out of that in that now you see what I mean if like now Uh-huh Well Bless your enemies if your enemy is hungry feed him if he if he needs your asks for your shirt give him your coat also So if the the the the South Vietnamese they asked us to help them Right Is that right Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah But then again yeah I'd say it is wrong to and I'm not saying president Bush made the wrong decision I think I'm lacking in my I don't think I can come to a complete conclusion on how I feel about the Vietnam war because I'm going to interpret that through the Bible and I've kind of always I've been a Christian five years and I've kind of avoided that that those the war things and how God approaches that because I think it's just now coming up to where I really feel like I need to come you know need to decide what I feel Yeah Right They left a woman and a child and a the sheep Yeah I know But then again though Jesus the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what I'm saying like so he didn't just say don't kill your don't kill your enemies but not only don't kill them bless them You know and so therefore when we have an enemy come against us  I really feel like that + I really feel like I know I do feel this strongly that when if we had someone come and attack us the best way to handle it would be to bless them and humbly go to their other king or the other ruler and say what have we done to offend you What can we do to rectify this situation and that God would move in that sovereignly and he would get the glory though no king no Bush wouldn't because it wouldn't make any sense you know what are I'm saying It would look absolutely ridiculously stupid but it would work out because if you follow the scriptural principals it's going to work out because those are that's the best way to do it you know spelling = principle but the thing is is that then God gets the glory not a president not a king and I think that's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory Uh-huh N- well I believe personally I ho- I I woman always says my husband always goes three that I guess Yeah if the one if somebody broke in my house I would pray that I would have this faith ta- to to take authority over that and I know people that have done that I know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes and just say I bind you in Jesus name your n- I just and rebuke any enemy because I believe it's a spiritual war that's going on and it's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home that's not normal there's something going on there and that I would have discernment by the holy spirit to deal with pride over that Do you see what I mean And then the same in Vietnam you would you wouldn't handle Vietnam the same way you would handle Saddam Houssein Hussein But I was I have a problem with all the killing but I'm not a new ager I don't believe I am not for one world government I'm not for all these new age things I I you know I don't have a problem with national identity and I'm an American and having different nations and all of this But I'm concerned about the killing that went on there because I just feel like God has a better way to handle it than that and
