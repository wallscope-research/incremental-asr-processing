Okay What do you think of the public school system First off do you have children that are in it okay Well then you should be a good one to know because I my children are grown now I now have grandchildren in the school system so I don't have firsthand experience right now with it So what do you think Right That's right Right Yes it is I I agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren we have a fourth grader and then we have one that's in kindergarten and and I know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing were doing in the fifth and sixth grade You know it's amazing to me and stuff that I didn't do until I was in junior high which of course shows my age Is that scary Right Now Yes Correct Are you finding that since you're doing substitute that you're wanting to do full-time I have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms And and d- are you do you find that Uh-huh Uh-huh Be uh-huh Coming up uh-huh Right Well I I know that this again this this friend is in the Plano School District and she teaches it mus- emotionally disturbed children And she says she has six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade And she says she's getting very frustrated and very depressed because the school is pressuring her to pass them on even though they're not ready But because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something I didn't quite understand it And
