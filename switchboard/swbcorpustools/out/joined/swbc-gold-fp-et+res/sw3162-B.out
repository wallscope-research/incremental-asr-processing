Yeah Right that it that it I a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not not de- and and not depend so much on the on the emotions of a particular case but be able to put it in overall perspective Well I I certainly haven't thought much about this but Yes yes some of them some of them do and some of them don't but this one I was trying to remember back It seems to me that that you know when I studied civics in school or stuff that this the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't wasn't so much And I'm I'm trying to figure out whether that's I'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state Yeah Yeah And I I guess and I don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some supreme supreme court decision perhaps that said that that as part of the trial by the peers that had to include the sentencing or too or whatever I yeah but I yeah I certainly wouldn't be worried about that I guess in terms of the you know ha- having a judge do it would seem to me to be more more fair and and unbiased in terms of doing away with the with the unanimous jury I guess I guess I would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in in the trial system That that's just a such a tradition that it's a that it's got to be a unanimous jury that I don't know where you'd where you'd draw the line anywhere else you know two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever But and and I I I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a just a bare majority  Yeah Yeah Yeah whatever Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Well And and I'm I I'd I know it is I know it is where I where I work But I'm not sure that that's that that's necessarily required you know by law that it has to be paid I suspect that's a that's a benefit of a bigger company But but there are certainly some Some that some that wouldn't yeah
