No I'm from Plano also That's right Right I just got back from Dayton I spent the weekend in Ohio with my family and the trees are changing color there So that as soon as we got out of the cloud cover Of course it wasn't sunny like it is here It was real gray but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and I saw all those trees it just really made me realize how much I miss the fall I don't complain weather wise though because it was also thirty-five degrees there yesterday morning and the high was only fifty and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies That's right Yeah We did that when we lived up in Michigan We went up to the upper peninsula and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure And then on leaf weekends it was which is this time of the year it's bumper to bumper traffic people as whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves because they had to keep watching the road Yes I think it is and my family said that in Ohio there was just an article on at the T V news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule as far as the coldness of the temperatures and the first frost everything just happened three weeks early this year Just so we don't have one of those famous ice storms in the spring Well I've only been here just a short time too so I haven't been through any of those either so I have in Michigan but in Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow and life goes on So as I understand it here if there's anything they'll call off schools and and close businesses Right Right the real definition of ice I think so It was nice talking with you Okay Okay Bye
