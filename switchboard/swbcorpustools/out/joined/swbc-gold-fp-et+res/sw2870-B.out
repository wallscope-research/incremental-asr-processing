Yeah I do I try and vote in every single election slash error; two utts But that's just since in the past say about six years Before that I really didn't pay any attention at all you haven't Yeah I didn't use to but now I really because I get so angry about what goes on and then I feel like I can't really complain too much unless Yeah But the problem is that I am very liberal politically and so I hardly ever have anybody that wins that I vote for Liberal politically I'm you know like pretty left wing Demo- Democrat so you don't Okay well there's a lot of them it depends on what issue you're talking about But Democrats are on a lot of issues are more liberal than Republicans and well it used to be it's kind of hard to say now especially after Desert Storm but I think back in the ei- times when my political opinions were being formed like in Viet- during the Vietnam war and stuff the Republicans were more you know what they called Hawks which is more like aggressive in war and more pro war and pro aggression and the Democrats were the Doves they were more for peace And I'm not sure how much that holds true anymore I think you know the issues are Yeah yeah and Democrats usually are su- more supportive of public assistance programs and and programs to the big Republican thing is that they don't they vote for less government they want less government involvement in society and so they're more less apt to vote in you know more aid to people or more they're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government running things So so have you ever voted at all You haven't How old are you gosh Well Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah Yeah well slash error Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah yeah Du- No it was Dukakis from Massachusetts yeah that was yeah Ferraro That was a while ago that was a couple elections ago yeah Yeah that's okay Uh-huh So what do you think about what do you think about what you see on T V about them like in the news or on the ads do you kind of just You don't Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Right You didn't get any government classes Yeah it's really hard too because before they used to have a lot of it seems like the stuff that they put out now it I doesn't just seem like it I know for a fact that the any kind of stuff that if you wrote and asked for material well what do you believe in what do you believe in they don't take any stands on anything They kind of say well what do you want me to believe Or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah they have to kind of take a stand on some things like abortion and things like that so that's kind of how I judge There's a few things where they have to say yes or no like abortion or gun control or let me see I try to look at what if some of the newspaper articles or the I don't trust T V as much but newspaper articles can show wha- how they voted in the past and but you get you know it all depends again on whose writing it and who they're for because they can slant that too Uh-huh yeah yeah Right everybody's got a secret So Well that's okay Do you think do you think what would it take like God this is really good actually tha- for to talk to somebody who hasn't voted what kind of how would it how what kind of stuff would they would you like them to do so that that you would know more about it Like send stuff in the mail or have it at the library or Uh-huh Uh-huh do you Yeah that will tie you down a little bit Or do you just not do you feel like it's not really going to make that much difference if you don't vote or Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh Well not in my family We're kind of we're really independent But a lot of families do that I know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote And that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved Golly But well Uh-huh Hart Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah yeah Yeah Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh I think everybody does it just depends on how well you can hide it You know and I that's very true I I think that doesn't really have that much to do with unless they've done something really horrible you know or something real abnormal Yeah right but otherwise Uh-huh Yeah yeah That's right I think that's that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run is that the the election the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that you know that really don't have anything to do with how well they do the job But see they're trying to find an excuse not to deal with what you know the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no And if they don't say yes or no then maybe somebody will vote for them that wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side Do you know what I'm saying So they just try and make it a personal thing if you remember any of the T V commercials from the last presidential campaign <> they all had pictures of Bush with his grandchildren walking around with his grandchildren and even from Reagan it was all just like looks like a McDonald's commercial you know That's about what it looked like I just thought he was really inept I don't think he did anything at all He they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet and the people that were Well I think that was part of it I think there's a lot of thin- the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the the recession and stuff people just had a picture of Carter as not being real capable but he actually all right this I thought he was great Did you I always liked him I thought he was great at the time and I I just couldn't get over the fact that Reagan beat him I you know that I just couldn't believe that he got voted out Uh-huh yeah You did Have you heard stuff about him lately do you know what he's doing Well he is just he is really active still politically He's been overseas You remember when he was in office he did a lot of stuff for the Middle East for pe-
