yeah Ever since I was a young and used to watch the old Apollo missions going off in classroom T Vs I suspect a lot of people got turned on by watching watching those go off very exciting The I've al- I've always w- wanted very much to be somehow involved in all that And to meet and and to see see it actually happen Of course I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday But that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately computer programmer Unfortunately that can be done from the ground Yeah Made the wrong wrong career choice to get up into space The I used to think when I was when I was younger that by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now frustrating at times I don't know what you think about all that Uh-huh Yeah Well slash error Yeah Well the I've always felt that one of the long-term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have some sort of solar power satellites up because that's a you know in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it that doesn't require any particularly nasty environment impact And you can just get as much power as you need up there It's just a matter of how big you build it and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing So the side effects of doing that which I think would be good you know very very good for al- for everyone in the long run is is it some of the other things I'd like to see happen would happen also so I'm Yeah right Right slash error Right The only problem is of course that that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there And they want to do the research and they're all you know nor- the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like the trip to Mars Which is would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth but the same money could probably be far better spent on lunar bases and solar power satellite research and you know so forth It it would de- it would be being done for the glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of instead of for you know we should eventually send someone people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so We should do it because for for the return we get for it And unfortunately that's not what I thinks happened listen I I would settle for the gli- for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the but the downside of that is you after you do one of those people say well we did it Now let's now we're done No need to use this anymo- to play around with this space stuff anymore That's what happened with Apollo slash error But I'd give almost anything to get into space sd But I'd give almost anything to get into space sd
