yeah something about the school system here Well then I'll I'll walk softly Yeah What school system does she teach in wow Well I think it's more of a there's a bigger problem here than than discipline in the schools I think it gets back to the parental participation into the program to give you an example both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District and it's a public system however you'd think that it was a private school because I take it the best teachers and the best students they're taking top three percent that have tested out you know in the district and put them in this academy system and to get into the system's very difficult But once you're in they have they have self-paced programs and so you have students that want to learn and you have teachers that want to teach and you have parents that are really interested in the children and basically there's probably some discrimination if you want to say that because most of the people that are in the academy system are Caucasian and because you have to test into the system And most of that's not all true but I'm saying a large percentage of them are/ and also the other large percentage is is that all the parents just about of these kids have college degrees at least one parent does And so there's I think that that's my justification for saying that the parents that are that are pushing their children at home even if they don't know what their children are learning they're they're saying do your homework let me see it don't get in trouble at school or we're going to be all over you Yeah Yeah I think what we've done is especially looking at the South Dallas area is that we're trying to bring the education level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed And that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if you're not don't have the proper education including exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do data base management and do I forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job you can't function you know So I think that the school system proliferates over to the business world and the business world then says we're not going to pay you unless you have the education and then educ- and then then we what we've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself
