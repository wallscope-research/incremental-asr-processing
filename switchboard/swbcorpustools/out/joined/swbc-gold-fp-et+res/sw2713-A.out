I'm actually at work I- I'm in facilities and happen to have weekend duty here I'm in the South Building We we pull mostly evenings We are having there's three of us facilities' managers are covering the off shifts Just to have somebody here from management to see if they need anything the how many calls have you made Okay I'm getting close to twenty This is the yeah hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one but I don't really have a lot in this one/ Usually I can talk for hours on most of the subjects they pick Go ahead you first Okay good Okay yeah Right Yeah I the worst one I guess is like you when it's a recording I thin- I don't mind so much someone calls and it's a and it's a salesperson at least you can chat or whatever and say okay now we want to go and then  when when they actually start off with a a computer and expect you to talk to a computer that's where I draw the lin- I just hang up immediately you know/ shut my other radio off here I guess they get their name- I'm I'm amazed the question about that the my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine and I have one too and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long if they catch your answering machine Yeah they they can erase all your others you know because if you have I think that's the way it is no mine I guess if it's full it will not take it I'm not sure But they can certainly block your answering machine so someone else calls you and your answering machine is full you know it won't erase But your right your> you're That was a good one Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I've got one it's not really an invasion of privacy 2 slash units  but it's annoyance for me in the office with speaker phones You know I the- they're great for an office but this one guy next to me who's not here just so I could talk about him he uses his speaker phone all the time and it carries over and so not only would you hear it seems to me that you talk longer from wh- you kind of yell into it and so he yells into it and you hear the other person too so it's kind of a double annoyance He actually ruins my privacy you might say because the the T I offices are so open anyway that I'm amazed that the fact that I'm about ready to say something if he's even thought of that that's a real uncourteous thing an an invasion of everyone else's time and and concentration to just be loud I don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and and annoying you know that's perhaps not quite an invasion of privacy but I think it is and yo- we both picked phone items there Go ahead do you have any more Seems to be 2 slash units  yeah that's that's a good one too Yeah Shouldn't that "yeah" be an indep slash unit  I heard something about not that exactly but go ahead Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I heard something similar to that I listen to I'm a talk show person And there was when I when I do my chores up at the rad- I'm a radio person I guess is what I mean And so I listened to was it five seventy which has continuous talk on the weekends and Neil Sperry and everybody the lawyers and veterinarians and all that And I don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a fin- a financial application all that information on there is really not necessarily even a your Social Security number you know they you should just put down the basics and put N A where you don't want to answer Whether it's your personal salary or whatever if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down and I was curious as to w- you know what specific things you you did have to put down But he says Social Security you don't need to put that down there Which I thought was surprising So maybe there's something along that same line where you know in all these financial applications that you make out you don't have to put all that stuff down there It would be nice to know what's what was of course of course they could say well I can't give you a card and you could say fine but you know some things will be private you know but he said just put N A and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your money they want your card But if you don't feel like putting it down just put N A you know Yeah yeah Yeah I haven't I don't have any friends down at the the Austin plant but I heard that they were really upset about the drug thing and we seem to up here have just breezed through that and apparently some other companies are having trouble that I don't have any trouble with it it's kind of unusual here we are in Dallas you know the biggest location and and it just breezed through and wasn't really no one was I guess was really too concerned about it yet in Austin there there were whether it was a class action or how far it got I don't really know because T I only had a few things on T I NEWS I think about it that they were objecting to but the some people object to that which I don't mind no problem at all you know Huh Yeah right Right I know I know yeah I served my time too yeah Yeah did they object too Uh-huh Yeah well I'm I'm all for it I it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or you know carry it to wherever you want to carry it really of course that would really be a big thing in a public school but I'm saying certainly at work I have no problem with it and I think it is they they found that it's been very low really I guess maybe at the locations though I don't know if they have it done but done it by location I don't really know if they need to publish that really Right Right Right But I think that was an actu- actually a good thing that happened I never considered it I guess it's an invasion of your privacy but it's something that is for the good of so many people you know to have everyone take the test right away and and hopefully maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that well I might as well get off you know if I want to stay so you know if that was an invasion of privacy maybe it was good sure Right Uh-huh Right Go ahead you got me more I 2 slash units  this is this is a tough one I don't really haven't thought about any of this They had gardening yesterday and all the repairs and boy I could
