Ok- okay yeah that's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe well it says why would you what you would have for a dinner party this is strange because I pressed one and I thought it said begin Okay maybe maybe we're all set Okay we'll talk for five minutes they interrupt at the end yeah it says what you would have for a dinner party I just happen to plan one out for Saturday I'll tell you what I'm going to have if I can find it Well I have this new fondue pot and I was going to do basic cheese fondue and I have two different kinds of breads and some ham and I was going to try something weird which you know when you have fish au gratin I was going to make some like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue I don't know if it will come out Yeah the cheese fondue I make some people like swiss I prefer cheddar And I'll mix I won't make I won't have a sharp cheddar because it for fondue I think it should be a little calmer than real sharp cheddar And then I was going to make other things like potato skins It- see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff And I was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a a vegetable yeah it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party Yeah instead of something greasy or my girlfriend's do catering and they always about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray I think they try and suggest it What I've been doing when I get invited someplace and bring something I make food kabobs You take little toothpicks and cut up pineapple and strawberry and even banana if you can do it just before you leave It stays nice and fresh Yeah Yeah I like those they they made a couple of those they made one for my bridal shower and I was pretty pleased I never made one for myself though But they look easy enough to make it's not Yeah Yeah you probably get this probably pretty sticky after you get done Then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because you know when you scrape it it makes the water Yeah something I do is a fruit is I'll get make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them Yeah I have two nieces and they they they go melt some chocolate chips Go buy me some strawberries Yeah ther- you know if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better but if you get a sour strawberry Yeah no they the strawberries are coming in season now from they're they're coming up from Florida of course I live in Vermont so But they're really reasonably priced they're coming up from Florida so Yeah Yeah I think the actually I think they get some of them from South America Yep they a lot of of a winter produce comes from South America Of course their seasons are switched So do you want to discuss the recipe I have a recipe if you want it filled a lot of people try to stay away from this but I make my own homemade pudding just because I don't like box pudding Yeah it and it if you well first of all I take about a quarter and a half of milk and I put it in a two quart saucepan and you put it on a really low heat And you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it it ends up burning no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot I don't let that worry me And I get the milk lukewarm and then I pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it and I have this thing it's called the slender blender it it makes the it makes a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough It's I don't know they're called moo goo leaves or something they're sl- Yeah They're real neat I think they're real reasonably priced some of them they used to be a hundred dollars and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert but I didn't get that one I got the Black and Decker kind But it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord and you beat this cornstarch right into the mil- the milk you know and it does an excellent job or just hand beat it I guess you could use a hand mixer but I don't think it pur- I don't think it gets it good enough And then before the milk gets too hot I add two beaten eggs and I really mix them in good And then about a half a cup of sugar and I let it pretty much I beat it like every minute for about ten seconds and it's it starts thickening when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little I don't know it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch and you just keep beating it in And it's the the trick is is to have this blender so if you were you'd have to probably almost go out and someone who's just going to make it first time it's you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders And then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened I cook it for a good once it starts boiling I just I cook it for a good seven minutes seven to ten minutes and then you can make chocolate or you can take it off and let it cool you put really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter and that makes french vanilla custard Yeah A chocolate powder Yeah that cocoa yeah the unsweetened It comes in like a real dark can our mothers used to use it And then Yeah we all used to yeah it's the unsweetened kind it's not like Nestles Quik I suppose you could use that I- Yeah but Well I used to make the regular pudding the chocolate and put it in the pie shell and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day where you cut the pie it would soak into the pie shell and it was like red and I'm like this is kind of groedy actually I found it in one of my mother's homemade cookbooks something she had collected out of WOMAN'S DAY or something So I think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or or a regular beater but Yeah but I still think a beater would do it good enough the trick is to get the cornstarch yeah right in the in the lukewarm milk Sometimes I put the cornstarch in a separate bowl and I would put it in the sink and I'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good It seems to be better than putting the the cornstarch into the liquid it once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top Yeah And I'll do this sometimes I'll put my after I pour that into my back into my saucepan I'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg So Yep And then you know if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to The cocoa even seems to thicken it even more Because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the sometimes the cocoa is like my husband really likes it thick he says I can stick the spoon right in this Because I'm always worrying it won't firm up because it when you take it out of the saucepan it's like boy I hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick you know when you cook a package it's it's a little less but I put it in a nice glass bowl and some people don't like that that film on the pudding so you can put Saran Wrap over the top And then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap so when you pull the Saran Wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap and I might put it back on But Yeah after well when it starts steaming a lot I definitely yeah put it in the refrigerator but I my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard That's yeah so that's why I do that So well I don't know that's my my great hard recipe
