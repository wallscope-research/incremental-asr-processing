What do you think about it Yeah Yeah I I especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else you know harm or injury absolutely And I don't have a problem at all with employers testing in the hiring process but I I I don't I don't have a problem with them too much testing even after the fact but I do a little bit where it where it wouldn't hurt anybody I don't know sometimes I think they carry it a little bit too far But Yeah Right and then it's not a problem Yeah absolutely yeah Tr- the train drivers Yeah I wish they would I wish they would and that I think is even probably more widely abused by you know the masses than than drugs so to speak So I know And No Just Yeah and Now T I has the random testing policy and and you know our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a in a pool so I've already been tested once when I was hired and and once since they initiated this random testing program But I work with one girl who was tested her name got got randomly selected three times in six months and I think that's the only reason I have a problem with it when there's no you know there's no reason to suspect someone you know That that's getting a little bit that's enough to make anybody paranoid Yeah Right Yeah Either just the lucky or the unlucky one depending on how you look at it absolutely There are so many people with with their petty axes to grind it could really get out of hand Yeah To report it and I guess you'd report that to a supervisor maybe anonymously or something because I I would feel very uncomfortable working with someone I knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol I'd just I'd feel really uncomfortable Yeah we have we have a lot of people who work on the line I'm in accounting so it wouldn't you know they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something but out on the line they've got people working some serious equipment So Put at risk I agree totally And in the long run we're all paying for that so it it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that I I was trying to remember there was a court case here where I live just a few months ago The city workers they wanted to the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing and the city workers took them to court to protest saying that it invaded their I guess first a- the the search and seizure amendment and it's still tied up in the legal channels They haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not So I'm curious especially since T Is a local you know employer is also already doing it seeing what they'll say about it especially since Well it's the whole it's the whole city seems like the whole group of city employees that's raising a stink over it Yeah So Yeah Uh-huh Right Yeah that's the way I looked at it If I had something to hide it's one thing but I'm you know you know you don't so it's not as big a deal and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether they're really concerned about their rights or whether they're really concerned about something else I don't believe that
