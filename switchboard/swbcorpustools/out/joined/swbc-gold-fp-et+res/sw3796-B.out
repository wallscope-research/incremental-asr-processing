You know what I watched a little bit of of the Bulls game and I had to leave in fact I I think the Bulls were ahead when I when I left Who won the game Is that right Uh-huh Wow they've got the don't they have the best record now Shouldn't the "Wow" be an independent slash unit  Yeah Wow They they do and they you know I think by by relieving some of the pressure off of of Michael Jordan really helped them out You know he doesn't have they don't have to rely on him to score ev- you know thirty or forty points at every at every game so I know I'm yeah I saw the w- + I saw the Warriors just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors Dallas game They look good Yeah now I don't I haven't kept up with what was going on with with the Uh-huh Good move Yeah I think Boston's in first I you know I haven't kept up with any of the other teams I'm so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks you know man That well yeah but just this whole year has been just disastrous for them and you know they're going I I think they're going for an all time record of how many l- you know losses in a row they can they c- they can pull out It's unbelievable  Well actually actually the the the Dallas area here pulls for Dallas San Antonio pulls for San Antonio and Houston pulls for for the Rockets There really not a whole lot You know d- you find them they're find them be to be pretty loyal in with the local teams you know it's kind of I guess it's kind of like there in the Bay area you know you don't find a whole lot of of Sacramento fans Really isn't uh-uh It's you know it's it's about the same same distance from here to s- to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento So it's yeah it's not really a local you know he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio and they they have got a great club You know Yeah Yeah that always makes a big difference So Yeah And you know you know I used to think that that one one player really doesn't make a club but it really does you know You get somebody like Magic and you can see the decline in that team Once he left you know it's it's just not the same it's not the same team There's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for yeah Who won that Portland game
