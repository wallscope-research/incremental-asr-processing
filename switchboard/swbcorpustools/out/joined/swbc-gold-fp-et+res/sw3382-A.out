I guess I've always been kind of interested in in space and stuff I've read a lot of the the astronomy books and and stuff like that to a degree I haven't kept up as much as I would like I've just been so busy I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then so Yeah Well I wouldn't even mind being a pilot on one or right now but I'm probably getting a little too old for that Right Yeah Well they they just made leaps and jumps I think a lot of our our technology we have is is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel equipment and stuff that Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I don't know if you ever watch Gallagher you know he's one of the comedians and and you know he he talks a lot on on Velcro Wh- i- what would we do without it Yeah Yeah Yeah there's there's a lot of a lot of little things that have come up I know maybe some of the big things that concentrated foods for one maybe I don- I don't know it's also just I've I've often pictured in my mind you know what it would be like to just what would you find if you just kept on going kept on going I guess our minds are so what is it finite when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object and it's hard to to see you know I always thought well what do you do hit a brick wall eventually It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely Yeah But Yeah I know it's I think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something And I I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like you know Yeah  I think that's what made us progress to the state we are is our curiosity There must be some better so- better way of doing this A better place to be or whatever you know it's So you you are always looking for something better I know at work people always complain to me I well you are always whining and it's I'm always looking for something better There's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it Yeah Well they are always finding easier ways and you know just because they don't talk about it or something like that And they are doing it un- you know unconsciously Uh-huh Right
