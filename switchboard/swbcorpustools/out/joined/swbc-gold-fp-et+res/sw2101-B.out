this is kind of tough I don't too often watch you know shows that are on on a regular bases I don't have a lot of time and I don't really like some of them to tell you the truth I don't thing they have any redeeming value But I watch things like SIXTY MINUTES every week ugh it's kind of tough to think of some of the others Although I do watch some of some of those frivolous things like on Thursday nights at nine o'clock when I get home from aerobics I will watch KNOTS LANDING Yeah just something like that for you know end of the evening type of thing but How about you Yeah I don't get that so I don't have that choice Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah But there's a couple of those I've seen once in a while I can't think of the name of the one that has the military fellow he's playing a military part He's the husband of the girl on DESIGNING WOMEN Yeah you know it wa- it was on one time when I saw it and you know it it's pretty cute Yeah Uh-huh Yeah no I don't I guess there's some things on Channel Thirteen that I watch pretty regularly On Saturdays they have a variety of things and a lot of times I record it and watch it some other time But they have programs on house repairs and how to build things and they have a calligraphy show and I do calligraphy so I watch that And they have a lot of cooking shows And you know I'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those I don't sit and watch them but but I enjoy some of it and especially if I'm cooking on a Saturday evening or something and one of those is on it kind of inspires me Uh-huh Yeah Yeah we do some of that In fact I probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on T V than you know other kinds of things Yes Yeah Yeah those are pretty good I I like those old ones much better than some of the new stuff Yeah And boy the movie can be unbelievable Yeah Uh-huh I'm not that hung up to most things if I miss something big deal Yeah That's true Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah We do too Too many other things to do and too much going on Right Right I agree Uh-huh Right Yeah Okay Well we probably exhausted that huh Okay I enjoyed talking to you Okay Good-bye
