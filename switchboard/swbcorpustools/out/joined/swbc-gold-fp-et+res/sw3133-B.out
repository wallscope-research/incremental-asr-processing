Okay No Yeah I think it's a good idea I think everybody should should put in their time so to speak for the for the good of the the nation and for the good of themselves I think it's would every- everyone grow up and mature and and realize what this country's all about Did you <> Oh <> Uh-huh Yeah Really Yeah I think that's probably like quite a few things that that the kids maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through you know they just they were they did things for people you know for their communities for their their families for their friends where now I'm not sure they really do Uh-huh Yeah that's probably true You know but even even through those groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to Uh-huh Yeah I think that's probably true I think it's probably more true still in the in the smaller communities then in the larger cities Well I live in Richardson right now Which is just Right Yeah okay Yeah Gosh I hadn't even thought about it being out of the area but you're right Yeah I grew up in a real small town in Florida I mean a real small town And I think it was just of course it was back in the in the fifties and I think it was real prevalent back then I I think people thought more of others than they do now You know as far as doing things for them and and then gaining benefits from it Uh-huh Yeah I do to I do to I'm not sure that that today's kids would go for it though I think you would have to start younger I I don't know how young you'd have to go but I think by the time they're early teenagers anyway I think it's too late now At least around here Right Uh-huh Yeah I think it has to start in the families first because if you don't do it for for your own immediate family you're sure not going to do it for anybody else Uh-huh That's probably true That's probably true Uh-huh that's great Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that's that's great I'm glad that there are still some areas that that get the youth involved in that sort of thing Like I said I think it does e- even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes <> Well No no I guess that's about all Okay Well good talking with you You too Okay Bye
