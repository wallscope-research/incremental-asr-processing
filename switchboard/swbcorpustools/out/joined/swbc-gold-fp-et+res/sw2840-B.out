<> Well <> I <> I think that in in recently with the I'm not sure if it's more a problem with American families or a problem with the school system They seem to be burdening the school system more and more with problems any problems that a child might have whether it's actually a school related thing or not and I Yeah and and well it's gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything If you've some kid who doesn't have who's from a broken family the schools are supposed to fill that void It's gotten way beyond  teaching + listen; 81012 seem like two utts you know teaching  classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like were kind of traditionally the school's roles Right Right Right Yeah Yeah Well then then again when you have a society where a certain percentage of the parents are doing drugs in the home either unemployed and don't care about a just a have their own problems how how do you expect the school to how do you expect the you can't really expect that parent who's quite frankly a loser in life as it is to to care about the the situation with their child and Right Right Yeah Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Right Right Uh-huh Right Well I I've seen more incredibly intelligent underachievers than than I personally I will I would take a person who's motivated and a little less intelligent than the person who is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of isn't motivated to do anything Yeah Well I not to toot my own horn here or anything but I I was graduated from my high school I was the valedictorian and I know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me and they proved out late when it came time to take the S A Ts Mine were good but they weren't great And when I got into college I struggled I struggled just to get my degree in the in the field that I was in Whereas I knew people that in high school were kind of lazy and all but they got motivated in college and they did a lot better than I did And when it Right Uh-huh Right You actually have students with with beepers Uh-huh where what are the what could they possibly be thinking how Yeah Right Yeah can you how can you how can you expect to Oh yeah I I I was sitting in the barber shop I'm an officer in the Air Force and I was having my hair cut and the barber got a call while I was there from his son's school His son's in high school And his son was failing gym and and having trouble with a few other things But you know it's like this guy was like why now there's no problem with my kid My kid's a great kid and all this The kid had missed all these classes and basically he his answer was I gave him permission to to miss Yeah Right Uh-huh Sure Right Sure Right It was good talking to you too Yeah Yeah I've had interesting conversations on several subjects not not just this but different the different things It's amazing how the you know people you talk to have some interesting conversations and it's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used at all Yeah that's true Yep Bye-bye
