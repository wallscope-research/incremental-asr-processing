Are you a player Has it Oh Yeah Yeah I hav- I haven't played in about two years and then I went out two weeks ago with the guys here I work at T I And I played in a tournament out there and I shot a net fifty-nine They were kind of little upset I guess I laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits I have a hard time inventing shots you know Let's go around this tree and you know try a slice through a hook here and I can't do that so I finally got out and I've been watching quite a few videos I had not been able to play so I took out a few videos and watched them for a while and I I hope I'm on the right track Shot a career low eighty-nine so and my handicap is twenty nine I like that Really Yeah I've tried to get my wife I bought her a set of clubs four years ago She hasn't even swung them but she wants to get into it now after I came home and won the tournament the other day she's she's ready to get off into it but you know I like I just like getting out being in the outdoors and I'm a hunter and fisher anyway but you know You know at least I can get out and play a few hours of golf and it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg really And I you know I walk I don't ride so you know I get a little exercise there too so Yeah Right Yeah Oh Yeah Yeah it's pretty nice We played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not They were amazed You know here it is sixty-five degrees we're out playing golf and they're freezing cold back there so But I actually I picked it up when I was in high school on the same as a P E course you know when I got into the service I got into it and now when I come out here I just kind of let it go and then one one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if I played golf And I said Well yeah you know I've got my clubs but I haven't swung them in quite a few years And then I got into it and then back out of it and it just seems like every couple of years I get back in there You know I really enjoy it It's really nice Yeah Yeah you don't want to go out and get beat to death but No And then you know we've got some guys here that they are you know four and five handicappers and they don't like to play with me because I'm too slow for them so You know but get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time And I've you know I've never never yet have I walked up now I've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with and never yet have I met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome They are always friendly Sure come on out you know and they don't mind if you make a mistake they don't mind saying Well you know let me tea- tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or You know it's it's pretty nice and friendly out there and you can't find that in all sports Yeah Yeah you need to Yeah yeah we we have one down here in the summertime it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock you know because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten And we play in the summertime out here We get a mixed league in and that's what I'm trying to get her ready for It's going to start well when we change time back whenever that is next month I guess and it will start then and you know we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago and they were just starting to learn and you know they were shooting a hundred hundred and twenty but they were you know now they're down into the hundreds nineties so it won't take her long You know And it's something we can do together so Well she doesn't do much hunting she could care less about that She's does a little fishing but you know golf would give her the exercise she'd be outside give her something to do that we both enjoy so Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah All right Yeah and it's you know it's a game that you don't like bowling you know you feel bad if you bowl a hundred But if you shoot a hundred in golf you know you don't have to be an expert to play Any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right So you know you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all Yeah Yeah And when you know when I first got back into it I used to get mad because I knew I could do something and I didn't get it done You know and I just well I need to slice this ball around here I naturally slice anyway now you know the ball will go straight and I go I never broke a club or anything but you know I'd get upset about it sometimes and now I guess you know being in my forties I just kind of mellowed out a little bit I don't get upset any more So and Well I've enjoyed talking to you I guess I'll go back to work All right See you later Bye-bye
