The AIDS issue is is a bit of a problem I guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end And how can a country stand to spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor I'm not really sure if it's true or not that we're not spending as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer there's some take breast cancer for instance It seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more pe- many more people than AIDS And yet more people die of it and yet the funding has already exceeded AIDS has more money than breast cancer So if it's true I I've I've always heard these things I've never bothered to dig it out and make sure but I've heard it on more than one documentary that they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and it's just one big P R campaign that yeah we think that's the world's worst thing so let's give money to AIDS And yet we've had breast cancer problems for years And it's just one of those course one of the shows I saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not going to get funded And having thought about that for a while Well I I kind of I thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing But then I got I got to thinking the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed a blood in- antigen antibody test for the antigen in the blood and that's fairly recent And yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years So it's not really cured yeah it's not not that heavily funded either and then that seems to be one of the the major problems that men have in the realm of cancer so I don't know I I guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to be it through different organizations March of Dimes type telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever how they fund whatever illness they wish It's kind of hard to to get an even keel on that it's really hard to say well there's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let's give it this amount and then this other one's only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way or Right Right That's true You know the the other thought that I had I've had several minutes to think about this after I while I  was finding people I I could think about the topic longer that the person that receives it so it's kind of a a unfair advantage as it were but the other thing that I thought of on this is I wonder if there isn't enough money in our economy or in our system it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good yeah they're kind of nice But we have such an affluent a- society society that I wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a a cure for just about everything Of course then we wouldn't have any room to put people but that's Yeah You know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this that or the other and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic but are they that enhancing for the for the masses you know They certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that but had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else
