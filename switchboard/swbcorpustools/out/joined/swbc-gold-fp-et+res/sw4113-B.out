Generally I don't think they are my my personal opinion is that the politicians are out for their own good because they they're entrenched They don't ever have to go out and get a real job They just stay in their current job you know what I mean I think by putting term limitations on you could you could slow down some of the problems but it has to be not just at the national level but at the you know the state and the local level too I know some senators and I don't know which ones but they've been in office since the the nineteen forties and I th- they've never had a job they've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes I know they pay taxes but they don't you know they they get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and you know I'm going like I I don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than I am and they work less you know less than I do I think I think that's true however I think that's always been true that's true of the Presidency too and we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover ever eight years or four years And They there is a lot to learn but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up I think two years is too short I think it would have to be extended you know a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms or you would increase the length of the of each term of a Congressman but maybe standardizing on on a a four year term for Congress Senate and the the Presidency and then staggering them so that you don't we aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years Uh-huh I think I think that that's true but then you have you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin the C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency the action isn't in West Virginia I hate to tell the s- the senator from West Virginia this information but it really doesn't e- ar- the world does not revolve around West Virginia as far as this country is concerned the world does revolve around D C you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics and the C I A is a a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia yeah you know it might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive and you know it it's a I think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that or is it the F B I I don't remember but I think there's Yeah that's officially we all know that that's not necessarily true But I I think that there are there are advantages to having seniority and turn- or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years I think there are there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain But I think that all with all the perks that we've given them I heard on the radio back a a few weeks ago during the incidents where they were you know like they aren't paying their their restaurant bills and they're bouncing checks all over the place one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks
