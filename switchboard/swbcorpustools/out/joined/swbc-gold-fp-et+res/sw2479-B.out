Are you there Okay Okay Yes I have one How about you my goodness Yeah I do I do I work and and Brian's in a day care center He's he was two in December so he's not quite two and a half yet He I put him I'm kind of had different different ideas from what probably the majority of people have I put him in a day care center from the very beginning He started in day care when he was eight weeks old And I just I don't know I have kind of the opposite opinion of most people I have had this real problem with a a private individual I I kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home with a with private individual when the door shuts that one person has total control and I always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around and if you get one bad apple there's are at least other people that can see it They can watch and I just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less You know how can you help depending on the day care center you know you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers have you ever noticed they're always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it you know kind of thing Yeah yeah You never hear about it really in the big ones So that's what I did and I have had just excellent luck I have been just so happy He's Right Right Well he was in he was in the same center for two years for the first two years and it was wonderful and I loved it and I was so happy there and the woman who owned it sold it But I thought okay I'm going to keep an open mind here and the people who came in it just wasn't it just wasn't the same and their their attitude and philosophy was just completely opposite from mine and I left him there for about a month and just decided I can't do this anymore and I moved him which was an extremely traumatic experience but but he's done well he's been there a couple of months now and I just feel so lucky Yeah How about you Do you work or do you get to stay home with them Wonderful Right Right Yeah I bet Uh-huh Uh-huh A baby Yeah I know how that goes Yeah Right right Did you have them in a center or something last summer Yeah that stuff is expensive It really is Yeah yeah I was going to say they're getting to the age where you should be able to trust that a little bit yeah Uh-huh To find the right one that's what we have to do though No Where do where do you live Plano Care provider that's wonderful That's great Right right Uh-huh I've heard that they were very good Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Yeah Poor kid was in school all day Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Even at that age they need that time we all need that time just some quiet time to wind down from the day Yeah yeah I think that's really important and we've already started about you know how young can they start T-Ball and soccer You know I just you know we both think of that that as just so important to get him involved in stuff like that and you could hardly wait he's he's so much fun now he's really he's really starting to get lots of fun and I can't wait until stuff like that starts happening you know and you know we did the Easter egg hunts which was really the first year he was really able to and to know what we wan- know what he was doing you know and enjoy it and it was so much fun and gosh he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant and God he got up on this elephant all by himself and Lord I couldn't believe it They had so much fun I bought us tickets and stood there in line and I thought I'm going to end up on this elephant with him you know He did it by himself so stuff like that is starting to come along where it's really getting fun you know Day care has just done just incredible stuff with him and he like comes home with something new everyday you know and so I know I know they're working with him and he's excited to get there in the morning and just doesn't even want to kiss me good-bye It's just like bye and he goes running you know and he's always having fun when I pick him up so you know Yeah this this day care is is it's Bright Steps in Lewisville And whenever you say Bright Steps everybody goes I've heard that's the best day care in town you know and it's it's one of those that's very hard to get into and they have this this this woman owns three day cares two in Lewisville and one in Irving and she had to open the second one up in Lewisville because her waiting list was just like you know like a year old it was ridiculous And she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other Yes so its She knows what she's doing all the teachers like about half the teachers are degreed teachers it makes a huge difference Uh-huh Yeah That's right That's right That's right And his old day care as much as I loved it you know and the owner I really liked her and she worked really hard to get good people but the people that she got were there because they weren't qualified to do anything else you know And and I got lucky and all of his teachers were very good Yeah but then sometimes you know Yeah it just went up the first of this month I'm paying seventy nine dollars a week for now So It's a little high but but it's you know it's like where he was before I was only paying sixty three so there's quite a little jump there but I looked all over Lewisville I looked in every day care there was in Lewisville and you know and there were places that were cheaper but is it you know your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money you know and I have peace of mind where he is and some of those other places I wouldn't have Yeah yeah Uh-huh
