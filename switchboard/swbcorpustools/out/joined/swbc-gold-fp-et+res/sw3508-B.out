Yes Right Really what what do you do now Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh really Okay Yes I do Yeah and I'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins Have you had yours now Yeah that's why I asked you I guess  it + Why treated as a slash unit when it continues in B28  you know it  does go in cycles I would treat this as a continuation of B26 utt2 and label it '+'  and not everyone got theirs right away And I I was so relieved because I've been making a real concerted effort make you know recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal-Mart collected it And my garage was just getting overwhelmed And of course I didn't go weekly so it became quite a big thing and Yes yeah Uh-huh Yeah well I found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two ha so it was wasting a lot of time  Why no slash B's next utterance is a backchannel to A49  Yeah Should be independent slash unit Thinking I was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned But you know but it it's not that hard now that I've got this system under control Yeah uh-huh Yeah I do find that I don't have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are are being tossed in with the recycling And I don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than what are some of the things they don't recycle one thing I thought about the other day were batteries just everyday regular batteries Supposedly you know leak and and contaminate the landfills and yet what am I going to do when I have a couple double A batteries to toss out And they don't take Yeah that's what happens because Yeah Yeah yeah but I think the city one could possibly look into that or something if they've got these bins for all the other little items I'm sure if p- people will have batteries you know quite often to to toss out Uh-huh Oh is that right  Registering our garbage Yeah Wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year Yeah Well except I know it would just not be cost effective They've already got all this money out on hiring getting the trucks and hiring people to work them I'm sure they couldn't afford that But  Yeah yeah it did Gosh my goodness It is sad You know they paid for those things anyway Or our taxes do Uh-huh
