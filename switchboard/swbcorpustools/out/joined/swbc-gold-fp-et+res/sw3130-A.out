Hi good morning Do you have recycling in Sachse Do really And it's twice a week Really We have recently started a bin program here in Plano where used to be we we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up And now they have these large green containers and you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there And then they haven't started curbside recycling yet but they're but they're planning on doing it very soon Apparently the trucks that they had lined up they needed the parts for Saudi Arabia And so that put off the program for a while But do you recycle Do they Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Uh-huh well that's great Well that's the way we started too My daughter was going to Camp Goddard which is through the Plano school system you know in the fall couple of years ago and she had to earn money for it and she was too young to baby-sit So that's how she started She started recycling cans and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and aluminum cans and plastics Uh-huh Uh-huh No the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans the rest of it we just do because my husband has become hooked on recycling And so you know we don't get paid for that but that's okay You know it's it's not that much of a bother really You just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever and we use a lot of two liter bottles and like milk cartons and things like that It's amazing how much plastic you generate Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah it really is Well all that stuff and how much how much we have reduced our waste You know that we we're generating a week I know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said there's no way you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week They were real upset but they weren't they were only picking up once a week And we said to them if you recycle you'll you know you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container And it's it's really amazing The other thing he does that my husband a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings No He he got a little mulcher thing It's just a little attachment for the lawn mower and we mow once a week You know no no more often then that And then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the on on the the lawn And it's amazing it's amazing We don't collect any of that and that that has cut down a lot in what we throw out Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Sure it does Sure it does It really does and it actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not if you're catching your grass clippings That that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn It's amazing Yeah Yeah Uh-huh that's true That's true That's true Well I I really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it It's it's really not that much trouble We keep a large plastic just a you know a garbage bag in the garage And as soon as we use something you know we crush it up and put it out there and then you know every few weeks we have recycling a recycling center like near Wal-Mart They're they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in and it's really no trouble And I feel like at least we're doing something You know I read a book one time a m- a magazine article and they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution but it's not If everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would s- save thousands and thousands of trees a day A day just from not throwing out your newspapers And when you read that you think well gee maybe it is a big deal you know Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Yes Yeah Yeah yeah yeah And that's and that's really not necessary It really isn't if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference It would make a huge impact So I'm excited about the recycling program in Plano <> I I can't wait for them to get it started because it'll be that much easier for us you know like I said now we have to take it over to to Wal-Mart It would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up  Now what what do they pick up It's just they do Uh-huh And do you have to sort that Or do you just put it all in Right Right So you're doing that now You're doing the newspapers and the glass uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh My husband would come home and go through the trash and say you threw this away He would get he would get all upset and I'd say it's just such an automatic reaction And now we think before we throw anything away it's really funny We we really once you get into the habit of it it's okay it's just it's just making it a habit that's hard Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh That's fun Yeah yeah yeah that's a lot of fun That's a lot of fun Well that's great Well I'm to hear you're doing that I my sister was here recently from Connecticut and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans
