Okay what kind of fishing do you do Uh-huh That's one of the few things I've ever fished for is rainbow trout What what kind of bait do you use to catch them really Fish eggs I didn't know that Huh Uh-huh I didn't know that That's a great way I think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish also look catfish personally I like to catch large mouth bass and catfish because they fight the best But a a catfish will really just tear into anything like that like liver or cheese or anything that smells terrible no Actually I always used to go to my grandparents' in Oklahoma and they have the Lake Texoma right next to them So the we used to catch some sand bass off Lake there's a Roosevelt Bridge and what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom and crank up you know turns on the reel about six to twelve times and the fish would be sitting at different levels So yeah you just leave it at that level and in no time something would hit it and you could pull them up two and three times in a row but you had to find out what level how many cranks they were off the bottom And if you left it on the bottom there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish And of course depending on how big your bait was you know would be depending on what you caught Yeah that was a lot of fun My grandfather used to do that and we used to have a light at the top of the water He'd really spoiled me in that respect Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well if you do you have any friends with ponds I well if you can fi- well or even a lake If seems like every time somebody's on the bank all they want to do is throw it out just as far as they can and bring it in to you But it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat You you want to l- make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm and just have it come into the water like a a regular animal or or fish well you know something coming off from the bank like they usually do So you don't have to really get fish from a boat you know because they're actually right there at the shore But I didn't used to be sold on plastic worms but if I am now yeah Yeah It just just a slow reel and then let it sit on the bottom but the key is to always have your line tight And that way you can feel when they're hitting it and believe me you'll know the difference crappie actually Yeah I've been fishing in the the ocean We're about three hours from the ocean And I also like Spanish mackerel And you catch blues and that's a different kind of fishing off the pier too Have you ever fished off the pier Uh-huh the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits and and jigs they have like yellow fuzz on a hook you know that kind of comes out Yeah Yeah get but they're a little heavier and they're bigger Get the yellow ones Those are the ticket And let them drop to the bottom and maybe do a a kind of a slow reel You don't even have to have a good rod or anything Just just even a regular line and you throw it out and the the other thing that's real good is small it's a real small rapalla It's about an inch and a half long and they're pure sil- all silver something real shiny about that long They'll go after that in a heartbeat also Just anything that really shines or spins yeah yeah That's it really That's neat
