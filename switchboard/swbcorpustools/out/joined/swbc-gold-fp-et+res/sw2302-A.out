Okay let's see I I believe in the trial by jury I think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for payoffs you know briberies unfairness one-sidedness you know all those kinds of things And I also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody I I really agree with the innocent until proven guilty theory I think that's that's a good way to do it That's about all Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Really Uh-huh Right Yeah Right Yeah that's that's a good idea Maybe this pre group of people could decide you know which kind of you know where they could go from there Do they need a big lengthy twelve person ju- jury or do they need a six person jury or you know those kinds of things and the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know how is this open and shut you know like you were saying or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened You know a jury like that They could be a good idea to that could work Yeah Uh-huh Good idea Yeah Yeah right that's Right that's that's a good idea I in the BIBLE it says if you have something against somebody to go to them first and if that doesn't work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them and if that doesn't work to take it to the whole church So that's right off that same kind of principle That's a that's a good idea Yeah that's true that's true too But you know that whole Biblical concept like that <> that's true in a lot of our you know the the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that It doesn't work on that but it's based out of that And so that you know that could work what is that called The Judeo-Christian ethic Judeo-Christian ethic Yeah Right Right right Uh-huh Yeah that's that's Really Really really yeah Mine too Yeah mine too Yeah same here What what part of the country are you from okay in in Texas Okay I was just being curious Okay Yeah well I'm from the Dallas area okay well that's that's neat are you really Wow Okay well I'll let you go And it was nice talking to you You too Bye
