We're supposed to talk about recent political developments Uh-huh Yeah They want him because he's popular not because he can do the job Uh-huh I I think they probably have a better education than the average congressman He he you know we know he's a good leader we know he's a good organizer The question is you know can he be the man who's ultimately responsible You know like what he said is you know a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about you know people asking why are you doing this why are you doing that He says I'm following the orders of my president I'm not the one who writes the orders I'm just the one who follows them You know Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait And so he went to the President and said okay here's how I want to do it But he wasn't the one that decided Iraq needed to get out of Kuwait Uh-huh Yeah Well the thing that I'm wondering about is how we get a new congress How do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long how do we get them <> to not get reelected over and over again Yeah I th- yeah Yeah That may be our only answer but I don't really like it I don't like the fact that the President is limited in the number of terms he can serve I think if the President be him Republican or Democrat I think if the President can prove that he's popular you know that he can do the job then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want I think the reason why we've got these guys in Congress is because of the fund raising rules how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year did they get after they were elected just you know just after they were elected two years ago Basically the people as soon as they get elected the people dump all kinds of money on them and say Yeah yeah you're my friend you're my friend and two years later he remembers that And what they done is they've bought this congressman for two years Yeah well That's that's the easy way I think the harder way out would be to make the guys that are in there and the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground That's what the financing rules and the the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff Yeah Yeah Well I think a lot more people could vote if they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about You know like you know the the recent election about how the Dallas City Council should be made up that election last December Yeah I'm in Dallas city limit Yeah It's an ugly mess The manager Well what get's me is this thing it went down to defeat last December by how many votes by just a few hundred votes And if it if it had passed if these people had gotten out the vote it would have passed and there'd be no more argument But they're still fighting about it because of the way the election went last December Uh-huh yeah But but this is for supposedly to benefit the minorities and all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote and they would have had their way Yeah it's pretty sad My my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going Uh-huh And and you ask them why they don't vote they say well they don't want their name on the jury duty list That that's where they get the jury duty list is from the voter registration I think they could Uh-huh Yeah In Presidential races that's about what they've done but they've got a pretty good lock on Congress and a lot of local things Right Actually I haven't made any calls but I received about a dozen I think yeah I have to make these but I get distracted and get to do something else and all of a sudden my phone rings and go Well what the heck we'll talk for a while Yeah we got a whole bunch I can't remember how many Well I think we've used up as much time as we're supposed to anyway We're supposed to do five minutes and that was three minutes ago Hey well thanks for the call Yeah bye
