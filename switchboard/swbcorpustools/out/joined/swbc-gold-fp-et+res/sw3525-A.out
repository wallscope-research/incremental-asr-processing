They tell you what our topic was Right How much of a golfer are you You bet I'm fifty years old I've been a hacker I think I think I played better golf when I was fifteen John than I play right now And I know it's just unreal I you know I'm a guy that plays if I play a lot of golf I play six to eight times a year and that's about it I figure that's my retirement game I really I come from a family of golfers I was raised by a man my stepfather who with a two handicap he he he he could get down on his knees and hit the ball further than most people could hit it And my mother who is now he's my stepfather is dead but my mother who is now seventy-one I can remember her being I believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap but but all they did every day in their life was to play golf every they'd leave work and go to a golf course or a little country club they belonged to back in Richmond Virginia and just play nine holes of golf That was their deal they But I just I just never could do it I have a brother-in-law who is an ex-college coach and like a pro and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family really Yeah Yeah I think I'm probably the same way Lessons do help I know ever year we buy I go to this Ducks Unlimited dinner it's a hunter's type affair and I buy in in Austin Texas I go down to Austin I live in the Dallas area but I go down to Austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine and we always buy this weekend at a at a country club in the hill country You know at Horseshoe Bay And we just have a ball and we play three days in a row three different courses and course believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the third course my score has gone from you know a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five So You bet so it that makes a lot of difference to me You bet Yeah That's super I haven't learned to hit the ball easy and I just sort of I'm always wanting to hit it hard and that's something my stepfather never could teach me you know just to relax and hit the ball and you know so subsequently when I do tire out from playing like twelve fourteen holes my you know a lot of my energy's gone when I do swing it's an easier swing and I do actually hit the ball better No I have a two through you know two through wedge I hit a two iron awful lot Off now + off the tee I don't hit a driver off the tee That that's why I need my driving lessons That helps Well that's that's a good idea I think this next year I'm going to I'm going to attempt to play more and I'm going to do the same thing I I laid off my woods about three years ago and I just use a two wood off the fairway and I'm a fairly strong person so I get a pretty good little drive and I and I guess control my irons better you know if you'll take lessons the first thing they put in your hand is an iron And I still remember that watching myself and my son so but I think the key is you just need to you need to play more often than I play Right Makes good makes good sense yeah You bet My cha- my challenge of the game is just if I can get off the first tee when everyone's standing around watching you I'd be great after that That boy I just if I get off the tee box and I and I've you know you know anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight I just want to get down and kiss the ground you know Because
