Well pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard Well we just bought our house last July and  it's it it the house is  forty years old so there's there's an established lawn and whatnot flower beds things like that but they've they've gone a few years of neglect So we're in the process of revitalizing the whole situation We've got different flower beds in front and a window box a built in window box trying to get some color back in those get the trees trimmed up get rid of a few weed problems and things like that So I live in Dallas Okay Yeah Uh-huh I'll bet I'll bet Right Right Yeah it's pretty high alk- w- ac- actually it's done it's in the north end of Oak Cliff in Kessler Park area and we've got about yeah we've we've got mayb- maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil and then it's solid rock from then on down so Yeah it's a little aggravating we can't we can't put in anything too big as far as shrubs and things like that because they've got to get a chance to find the find the cracks in the rock But Yeah it is It's it's solid limestone you just we're just happy that there's trees already there so far anything like that is is a major undertaking I guess sprinkler systems or anything start to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock But and it you know no- not even consider considering a pool or anything like that that's that's practically has to be blasted in I guess But and it makes it makes for a a different challenge I've never well I I moved to Dallas about five years ago and I never really messed with anything gardening or anything like that until now but I I keep hearing all the stories of of different parts of town In fact we even we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that and the first thing the the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said I've got I've got a dozen different varieties and each one works in one part of town and that's it That's basically what he was trying to tell us Yeah Yeah it Yeah that wou- in fact we put in some some more roses yesterday different a few different hybrid tea type varieties Yeah Okay Yeah Yeah that's we that's what we're searching we've got we've got all the different lake editions around the house and we're we're kind of experimenting right now We do we've got the direct sun in front and the backyard has two great big spruce and and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall so the backyard is just complete dark all day long And we're we're struggling to find something for those areas No they're they're in pretty good condition we've been we've been pretty lucky on that Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah That's true That's true It's bermuda Yeah Okay Right Yeah Okay Uh-huh Yeah it's there's such a there's such a difference through the year Uh-huh Uh-huh that's it Yeah wow Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Okay Uh-huh Okay okay Sure Uh-huh Wow That really is it it would it seem like it be just the opposite when you get Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that's true that Yeah that's true That's true Uh-huh Yeah that's something I've been been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are at this time of the year and you know we're trying to decide what what to what to put on one side of the house and things like that but there's so many things that they they last for just a couple of weeks and then it then it's just a a bush there from then on It's kind of it's kind of disappointing Uh-huh Yeah
