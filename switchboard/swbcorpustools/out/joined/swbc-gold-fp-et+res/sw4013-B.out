we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging bicycling going to the park some time watching V C R movies generally cheap things That's right Yeah Most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa We get an occasional one or two day thing but most of them are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa In Arizona Yes we don't go very often for holidays Generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays and let Grandma and Grandpa come and visit us They range from twenty-four to five That's right How old are your children I think the hardest thing for us has been is to find ac- you know leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together with the age span that we have you know like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing but the young kids don't understand it and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that and Yeah I think it's improving actually We had an interesting experience the other day We we have pretty much a a routine that we spend we don't have our kids play with other kids on Sunday and we just kind of keep them at home and our next door neighbor we were at a soccer game Saturday and our next door neighbor was there and somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend Saturday night at their house and she said no Sunday's our family day and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them And I think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now I think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction and I think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now Yeah I think a lot of people are panicked how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something So Utah's a lot better than Texas Very few definitely When we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense But Average My wife and I were in Utah until I guess we were about twenty-four Never been back since then but We have kids up there now so we get up occasionally Where where in Dallas  I don't have any idea I've never heard of it Must be a little town Yeah
