Okay does is this something that concerns you Uh-huh Right Yeah well I live outside of Dallas and it's kind of in a little suburb So I feel pretty safe out here but I know the murder rate is going up every year in Dallas and that worries me Yeah Yeah there's a little boy just got shot and killed like last weekend down in what they call the projects which is you know sort of a bad area But he was just out riding his Big Wheel and a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet That's really sad I've so you know it must be frus- frustrating for the parents who can't get out of a situation like that It'd be so scary It really doesn't it's kind of scary I think that I think the laws have gotten so lenient you know the court systems are too lenient I think that's part of the problem Yeah they do that here too But I say you know they commit crimes let them be overcrowded you know let them suffer a little bit Yeah I think so I think if they knew it was going to be really horrible wherever they were going maybe they'd think twice about doing it Yeah You know the other thing that worries about it is kids that are doing such bad crimes so young you know like eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill people They I don't know if that's just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything but that worries me I wonder what the next generation will be like Yeah Yeah Oh Yeah Seems like if they had imme- more immediate consequences to their actions it would sink in faster Really yeah Yeah because it seems like now even in the country you hear about bad things happening Yeah I think they have them in Dallas because I hear them talking about in the schools different things happening and they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools Me either Yeah seemed like like in the fifties when gangs were big it was just to be part of the gang but now they're so much into selling drugs and weapons and all that it's pretty scary Really yeah those machine guns and all that Yeah that's scary It's a wonder there's anybody who's willing to be a policeman anymore Yeah Dallas they were saying in Dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen but they keep losing them all the time and that you know eventually we're going to be way short on the number we need because they won't let them hire any new ones and they keep leaving Yeah they figure what a heyday It really is Well there's someone at the door so I guess I'll have to go see what my dog is barking about But it was nice talking to you Well thanks same for you Bye
