yes Well I was from Illinois originally and I grew up a Bear fan And then we moved here even when we knew we were being transferred here we became Cowboy fans And we had some wonderful wonderful years there under Roger Staubach And we kind of got spoiled We expected it to continue forever I think they're doing pretty well this year though I think two I know they lost yeah to Washington and Philadelphia Yeah and wasn't that fun I went to the balloon festival in Plano and carried my little portable radio with me and I must say I attracted a lot of attention People running up saying what's the score what's the score That's right and that's exactly what they said <> my wife dragged me away from the television You know but I wasn't I had forgotten or I probably wouldn't have been there Yeah That's exactly where both of the wives came from I think It was you know it's easier to join them than fight them And if you want to see them you might just as well enjoy football And I used to tease my husband sometimes and say my gosh yo- did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about these games Well it takes a little brainwashing first Yeah Are you transit usually do you stay not in one place too long Well it will take you a little while but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for for Denver I know Well if they close it in see we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing But Dan Reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway Yeah that's right you know he was one of ours one of our boys So we are never we never cheer against Denver unless they're playing the Cowboys Yeah Uh-huh Johnny Elway Well there is so much about it to like You know it's so exciting And when the Cowboys won the Superbowl here of course they put together some real cute songs and we all ran out and bought the records and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item Uh-huh
