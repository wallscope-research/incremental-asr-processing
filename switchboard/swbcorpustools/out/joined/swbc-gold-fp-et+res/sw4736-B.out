yeah That's that's as far back as I can remember Well that's before my time actually Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself It's at that point where they're saying like here you're you're going on death row but you'll stay there for twenty years And nothing is being done about it the laws exist and are frequently upheld in in in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find And it's it's really getting out of hand in many states Well it seems like well it it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes albeit it seems that we are failing in that in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off for instance there's a case a few years back where someone someone who's being convicted for was under a tri- was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality in that The of- the arresting officer did not read the defendant their rights And where his old evidence was there the witnesses were there the everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet
