Well I I just think the way that things are going that it would be good for young people to go ahead and have dedicate themselves to at least something I know like the Mormon religion you know they require two years of service missionary service right the boys yeah and so but I think it would be good for all young people you know to be able to to do something like that so that you know I don't know I just feel it would be good for them to do that Yeah Uh-huh sure yeah and and even even in our home towns there's a lot of public service things that they could do you know drug rehabilitation and and alcohol and and just helping old people and you know helping cripple just helping somebody else and I think that art of giving is something that we don't have very much any more I think they just gave it a title but is this not something that's in legislation or in work some yeah no no it's not it's just a just a topic I think so too I think so too because there's so many kids who have you know so much money and so much free time and nothing to do and nothing to give their time to they don't even have a direction to give their their time to so I think it would be really good for people to to be able to give their time in in some kind of public service even in our government you know as aids to you know Congress people so yeah it would be it'd be really good I think Uh-huh Right yeah yeah I agree with you This is something that like you say is it's character building you know learning how to to give to others and being less selfish and Uh-huh Right Uh-huh uh-huh yeah I agree with you I agree with you and I think young people are so focused just on themselves and their activities and whose going out with whom et cetera that you know to get a taste of what the real world is actually about doing that public service would be great Yeah Right Uh-huh yeah I would think so like right after high school you know even if it was the the their that summer right after high school you know three months Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Right right You know something that out that was outside of outside of school yeah but yeah you know right right after you graduate from high school because a lot of people are just Well gee whiz what do I do now if they're not focused on going to college and you know having that that gung ho plan that's you know setting their life goals Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah so to me see that would be the the the greatest time for you know teenagers to to do that would be right after they graduated from high school But as for its being required you know we're just not we're not based on on that type of a system Uh-huh Right right Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah yeah so yeah it'd be good but like I said requiring it would be
