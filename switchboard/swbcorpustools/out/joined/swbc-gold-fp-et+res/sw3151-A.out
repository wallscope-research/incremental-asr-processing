Well basically I think it would be a good idea myself I I think if somebody's not on drugs they have no reason you know to be afraid of it I do think that there has to be some controls like I don't think one test positive should be <> the end of it you know I I think they should test more than once It Uh-huh That's right <> Uh-huh Uh-huh There's so many jobs that really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life and you know and it's how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it You know and I just I I think there definitely needs to be some control to it I guess it is possible to have a false positive report Uh-huh Uh-huh Or somebody's test gets mixed up with somebody else's those things do happen I certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined wrongly Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do that doesn't require the testing to me it's to me it's not an invasion or privacy I think it's people have a right to know if if their their life maybe's in jeopardy  or + Yeah Their work the work they're doing for their company those things are all affected If not immediately it certainly does eventually I think that's where a lot of the problem is at first It doesn't seem to bother the quality of work but eventually it does Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Course I feel the same way on the AIDS problem I I don't think that's an invasion of privacy that's the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for you know and it's destroying a lot of people's lives Yeah and it's you know it's it's destroying people's lives and I I think that person plus anybody in danger should should b- know about it and be aware of it I don't know It's it's kind of hard to <> I guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that that an invasion of privacy Of course that's not supposed to be what we're talking about today I guess So I kind of get off on a tangent here do you work for Texas Instruments Uh-huh  that's probably why my brother did live in Grapevine Texas That's near Dallas Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh It's pretty hot down there probably Yeah did you really that's great Uh-huh We we need rain real bad up here It's everything's really getting dry It's Yeah It's kind of at a dangerous level here People hauling water and it's getting real bad So So <> So do I I can't think of anything else Uh-huh Uh-huh I can understand I know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them I can see them objecting You know there's a lot of people that think that there's nothing wrong with <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh I'll be darn Yeah yeah the different cultures and that too No no I'm sure it would have to affect you the same way I I can't think that would make any difference whether it was legal or not it it would still have to affect you the same way Uh-huh Oh yeah You can't you go by their laws The same way our people have to go by their laws when they're over there That's why a lot get in trouble because they have to follow their rules and some of the countries are very much against drugs and you use them you <> pay for it Yeah a lot of them Yeah Where where is it they lose the if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger Is that where it is I thought wow You know that's quite a deterrent Yeah Yeah Yeah So I guess you know we re- we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about <> how great out country really is Uh-huh Uh-huh They they abuse it is what they do Yeah Yeah So
