What kind of lawn and garden work do you do does it really I didn't know that Did you've been working on it for three years Really What have you done Uh-huh You know I can barely hear you Yeah a little bit yeah Uh-huh wow How did you get rid of them Pardon Dursban Two yeah Dursban will get rid of just about anything I think But so you haven't had a problem with that since Yeah What else did it did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to Not really Yeah Really Well that's pretty wild Yeah we used it for fleas We had fleas in our yard real bad last year and we did that I just I'm not basically I like to mow the lawn believe it or not but I sometimes have problems starting the mower so a lot of times I won't get out and do it but my husband basically does most of it and he does the you know edging and all that kind of thing and we're renting and so we don't really put a lot of money into the you know like this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt and some Saint Augustine We just we have winter rye out back and we have I don't even know what it is out front but we this is the first house we've ever lived in and we're just not real into the lawn probably because we're renting I guess So it anyway Right Uh-huh We were getting What really I wonder why it does Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Really Well I'll have to remember that because hopefully we won't have them this year but we have a cat that comes in and out and the cat was getting fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house so we had a real problem last year with fleas and it was quite a drag because we got them in our house and we're Christians and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas and we got rid of them believe it or not with smoke bombs which is just about impossible to do but we did and so we don't want them back this year you know so I'll remember that if we see it's a problem in the yard we're almost they were so bad last year even ticks I don't know we've had ticks before a lot and we've had to get out and treat our lawn for that I think we used Dursban for the we used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing you know and spread it all out everywhere but that's about the extent of our lawn care So I don't know do you enjoy doing it Yeah well that's well that's funny Yeah not everybody enjoys it though Everybody has a different thing I kind of enjoy it and my husband doesn't I kind of have to sometimes I'm too busy to get out there and do it and he you know he doesn't really enjoy doing it but he'll do it and he doesn't gripe about it or anything but you know I'm kind of like you and he's kind of like your wife you know in that he doesn't really enjoy it but I would like to have a garden you know that's my thing but right now where we're living we have the trees where their roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground I don't know what kind of trees they are but you can't have a garden you can't till it or it'll it'll tear up a nice tiller So we're going to wait until we move We don't have a lot of sun either because it's big trees back there So we're going to wait and when we move that's one of our priorities is to get a house where we can have a garden And so I'd like to do that I have a feeling I'll be out there all the time taking care of that but that's our next thing Do you have a garden Uh-huh are you kidding That sounds fun Where do you all live really wh- Southwest where really because we're in Dallas I guess I assumed you were here Well that's neat And yeah that's what we want We have a yeah that's really what we want but we just haven't been able to do that yet so one day we'll be able to do it and I'm excited about it And then I don't know anything about it I have to learn and then you'll have to give me a call on gardening What do you do in your garden and I'll go nothing what should I do But anyway I guess that's about it though It sounds like we've covered all the bases so I guess we'll let you go and do you have anything else you wanted to say Okay I know you too I hope you have a nice day and we'll talk to you later Bye
