Yeah well I about just over a year ago I bought my own house so this has been the first opportunity I've had to be working on my own lawn and garden and you know when back when I was a kid you know mom would send me out to weed the garden I I'd hate it you know Now I sort of take pride in in the yard and you know how the place looks and so I don't mind doing it so much anymore Well it's yeah it's it's primarily just like landscaping a little bit You know I've got some bushes around the fou- you know foundation planning things like that and then there's some just some little flower beds and my mom grows she's an avid gardener and she starts her own stuff from seed now and she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the wintertime and starting them she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden They have a huge yard and a huge house and so she brings them up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Jeez that's more than that's more than the property I have right here that you've got as a garden that's amazing Right jeez Uh-huh Uh-huh Are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line Yeah I can't even hear what you're jeez it's gone Well I don't know there was well whatever it was there was a second there I couldn't even hear what you were saying but Yeah I guess I was having a hard time there too I thought it sounded well I guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people doing this work But yeah that's a heck of a pla- you must have a lot of different stuff you get out of there especially up in Vermont there you should have some really nice soil Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh really because of like the cross-pollination or  My mom put cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once and the got cross pollinated by the bees And we ended up with these these like things on the cantaloupe vines that were looked like round big huge round cucumbers Yeah there these were like some mutant  No it's just the like the bees and insects will do it Either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something Yeah Uh-huh well Yeah when I my family used to live in Littleton Massachusetts and when we moved in there we had a a really wet backyard and my mom wanted a vegetable garden So we trucked in I think it was seven what was it cubic seven yards cubic yards I think that's how they measure dirt yeah seven yards of sand I got to shovel it all lots of fun Uh-huh Sure Right Well it seems I've seen a lot of people use them you know for flower beds but I don't know what whether they'd have creosote would do anything  Uh-huh Well  you can get + you can get pressurized lumber that's right there's even there's bad chemicals in those too All right Right Well you can see it a little better and it stands out  gee Yeah Rub up against the siding Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah they're like I think I've seen those before but I don't remember what they look like So it'll give you room to get under it sure Yeah  a tree is always something very nice to have then you got to get him to if he's going to do it you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it
