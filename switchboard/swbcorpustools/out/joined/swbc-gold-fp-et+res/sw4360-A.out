let's see How about let's see about ten years ago what do you think was different ten years ago from now Uh-huh <> Uh-huh We Well actually ten years from today seems rather short but I do agree that generally it's society has sort of let's see rushed everything ahead And I don't know it leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that In other words they just prioritize their lives differently But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation  It depends it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too I just I'm twenty-eight Yeah Yeah I just I think that things were a bit were have been busy all along It's just a matter where priorities are at placed And that usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home And now it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work I think that's part of it too But I do think No no I don't No I don't think that But then there are a lot of people that that don't have that But that really do need to work I think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents just to survive And then there th- is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that they think is is surviving which is really more luxuries but I I tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive I'm saying that the the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing middle class in this country I think that that's in my opinion the case So I have met people that both that that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job Uh-huh Uh-huh Right
