It sure is I play at least three times a week I'm on it No Well I'm one of those rare left-handed golfers And I do enjoy playing Right now it's three Well if you play with some consistency though you can get it right back down well we can usually play here year around Sometimes in January it's not too comfortable to play But there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play and I'm pretty much addicted to golf so I get out there one way or the other It's a good game though It's very challenging and the reason I like it so much is because I'm essentially playing against myself That's the way I look at it I I play in in lo- a lot of groups and but I they keep score and between themselves but I really don't care I go out and each shot I say well this is what I'm going to try to do and then I see how close I can come to that Yeah and i- inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another Either I'm not driving very well or I'm not hitting long irons very well or I'm not putting well or but sometimes it all comes together Well we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst And I went to that Craig Statler won in a playoff But we this is a big golf area We have a lot of I'd say we probably have within fifteen miles twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course Pine Hurst and we still have the Greensboro Open here every year Yes we do as a matter of fact It it it's only been that way in the last five years But now you most of the courses have a two day advance tee time you have to call That's some cold golf too isn't it We have cold Usually January and the first two weeks of February But last week we were in the seventies Something is coming through now so it's like in the low forties right now But it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties We have very windy winters and very cold But we don't get any snow anymore I don't I don't know what changed that pattern We used to get four or five inches a year Now we get nothing It's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall No but I have played golf in the snow before slash error Get out my orange golf ball and go out
