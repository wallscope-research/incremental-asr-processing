Hello Hello Hi Boy it took forever to find somebody Good well I'm my name's Gail and I guess we have to talk about credit cards Okay well if you're ready then Okay I'll press one Okay well I'm not this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me because credit cards are my downfall I just find it so easy to to charge something when I don't have the money to pay for it and I'm really trying to get out of that habit So I think they're kind of dangerous Uh-huh Yeah me too Uh-huh Yeah that's true that's true Seems just like our society is so pushes so hard for you can have it you know and then no interest no payments for a year and stuff like this they're really trying to get you into that situation because they know they've really got you then so Uh-huh Uh-huh It's funny that we've got a Sears card and we bought a washer and dryer on it four years ago and we still owe I I think like half the amount that they cost in the first place It's just you know you never never get it out and now that's real irritating Uh-huh Well we did you know one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck and so we went down to the bank and they said Sure we'll give you a personal loan It was only a thousand dollars that we needed for the truck And they said sure that's no problem but you know why don't we consolidate your bills and at the time we thought that would be great you know we could and it's going to be a lower payment than it was for all of them you only have to write one check a month not all those You never miss one or whatever and we did that but we didn't realize at the time until several months later that we we were real this was four yea- three years ago we were pretty young and we were just kind of like well I guess that means these credit cards are closed and we didn't you know about six months later we realized we could use them and so we charged them all up again Yeah So then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment for all of them So we were paying like twice so we didn't ever make that mistake again luckily But we're definitely working on not doing that credit thing We just as a matter of fact this it's real interesting the subjects I get They always seem to be so pertinent But we just discussed this last night at church talking about debt and things like that It's so so alluring and + so easy to get sometimes Uh-huh Yeah yeah Yeah That's true I just picked up my daughter and she was eating a cupcake and now her crumbs all over Yeah What a mess you are so I don't know if I if I I just feel kind of My big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our Visa card and I just thought you know if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something you know and we had to had to buy one then we would really need that and so he said Okay we'll keep it and then we weren't smart enough to not use it so
