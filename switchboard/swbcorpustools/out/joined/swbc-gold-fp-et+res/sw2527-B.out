All right What what kind of camping is there in Texas Uh-huh Yeah So you do like backpacking and the like Uh-huh Huh Is the Ozarks in Arkansas Yeah so that's probably a pretty nice place to go <> Yeah I've been camping for years not on a regular basis but I first started camping out in the desert in California And then sometimes in the mountains also in California and then I moved to North Carolina and I I didn't camp for a long time and then I started to go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting so I'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting And then maybe camp another night and drive home And that was that was pretty good so I went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear and you know I still do it once in a while Uh-huh Yeah well it's it's in terms of north south I would say it's a little a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it So what i- Well it it's actually the the Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh They're about three hours away if you go due north of the Blue Ridge in North Carolina I think are much nicer and you can pick those up going west but then you're talking about six to eight hours The way it works But it's a real it's a real nice place to go and camp and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although I don't think Raleigh I don't think the state of North Carolina takes they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might I think there's quite a few I can't say I've checked them all out though It's it's actually kind of incredible it's really really nice I like it better than almost anything I've ever done Just the sky is so amazing You know you really can probably count thousands of stars and it's it's just kind of nice I like the I think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which a lot of people don't realize you know they hear desert and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry and lack of water course it it has all of those qualities but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find anyway else except in a desert So it's pretty nice The the movie THE DOORS has so- some nice desert scenes those guys all go camping out in the desert Of course they drag a lot of drugs with them but the the shots are are pretty nice and it's sort of like that it's just almost surreal in some places It's very pleasant They can be yeah you got to you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what's going to happen I've been camping in Death Valley one doesn't go in July But it's beautiful in February it's just beautiful The days get up into the high eighties maybe the nineties but it's it's quite bearable and then the nights are reasonably warm you know sixties or seventies It's just great It's really very nice Yeah Well that would be that would be pretty nice I've been I have been camping on the south rim the Grand Canyon That's okay A lot of people like to go down and camp down inside I was just too lazy that trip to do all that walking especially with my gear yeah Yeah it Yeah it yeah it really is I don't think I ever see the Little Dipper you hear people talk about the Little Dipper But I don't think I ever see it except when I go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in in the mountains Otherwise it's just too faint <> Yeah I think we fulfilled our obligation Well thanks for calling nice talking to you Okay bye-bye
