Okay so we've got to talk about music And do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind No not a seventies baby Is it disco or is it like but okay So so they can get like the Doors and Led Zepplin Yeah that's cool And how about the Rolling Stones that's when that's when they took toured How about Pink Floyd Okay So so then we got we got some same things because No it's very hard because see well in the whole spectrum I'd rather listen you know I listen to heavy metal or classic rock We're talking about what they what they call hard rock Like for example let's see Bad Company what well they're like for example A C D C Why have you heard of them Okay And stuff like that That's that's that's not really hard rock Okay Well Cinderella is is hard rock heavy metal But see for example they have see what but other bands consider it like really hard rock It's like brash metal which all they do is like they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar and the guitar is set like really low and what happens is like everybody gets like totally into the music and then they start dancing around and they just bump into each other like like they hit each other with their shoulders and then you knock people down and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people No I don't like that music But that's that's what they do That's that's what some people call like really heavy metal And see the difference I guess between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also Like really like heavy metal wo- is considered like the words heavy metal and like you always thought about like suicide And killing people and stuff like that And just hard rock has they they don't talk about that they just talk about like life in general Like Queen's Reich if you ever heard of them Yeah Okay well no I said Queen's Reich but but but you got to like Queen also So because Yeah especially God what is it A Night At The Opera Don't they have a no let's see the one that they have the the whole opera singing in the background Bo Bo Bohemian Rhapsody Yeah that that was great I heard that the other day on the radio and I pumped it up Because I just love that song Yeah but they had that that whole record was pretty good But then they started going downhill like everybody else Yeah they're they're still around they've got a ne- new C D out but I I wouldn't buy it Because see what happens is the old see whe- I like I like the old Rolling Stones I don't like the new stuff Yeah Yeah Well for example I used to like old Phil Collins An old Genesis listen And and then what happened was that Phil Collins said hey I can make money a lot of money doing this and then he came out with see for example his his record like No Jacket Required That was good but it was on his way of going downhill because he said I can make a lot of money just singing alone and then he came out with the Invisible Touch with Genesis and that really like now I hate Phil Collins I can't stand him Because I look at him and I say you know you were singing at this time and with these people and you were great and now you're singing all this stuff that doesn't matter what you what you sing or what you record it's still going to be a number one hit And so that's that's what gets me mad But did did you go see that new Doors movie Yeah I saw it when it opened Yeah Well it it's you know it's like I was watching Siskel and Ebert slash error you know like those guys that criticize movies And they both loved the movie right They said the music's great it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that And then one of them said well everything is great but I'm going to give it thumbs down And they go but why Because it's like the end is like really depressing And so But it but it's like the movie is so well made and the music that goes with it just picks you up see I was never I was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine So so for me No but you learn to it's just that like the the sixties music's got a lot to say I I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too You know I was like Hey but I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants Yeah yeah Did did you go to college that's cool Okay Yeah yeah Yeah Well they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in in progression ever in history So No about everything So it's like nothing happened during the seventies Everything happened during the sixties the seventies I don't know what they're called you know it's like like the the eighties are called like the progressive years or the or you know like the technology years because of all the computers and stuff But the seventies got nothing nobody cared to name it So Yeah I know Can you imagine the like a big picture of John Travolta ta-da what is it SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER Him just standing there Yeah that's a good example to look for in history Well from now on we're going to go from the from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first step on the moon to nineteen eighties Okay what happened in the middle Don't worry don't worry you're not you're not missing anything you know so Yeah really And that's that's why I guess everybody yeah it's like they don't want to talk about that so they just don't name it it was it was I guess it was pretty bad times well let's see yeah okay we've been talking for seven minutes so Okay all right so I'm going to leave you alone what what are you doing Do you have a family Okay I'm sorry okay Okay All right So then have fun doing this It is not that bad Bye bye
