I think actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the working for a large corporation And for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit I think it's health care It's what I think everybody would say that Right Belonging to a group is the belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you so- the sometimes I think it's more important than salary Yes And I don't know if I would rank that second but since I have three boys it it can turn out to be important Yeah you know in a in a given year dental ca- dental expenses can really kill you Right Right It's Right and then if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodony will I guess that would be up there I'm not sure if I would rank how I would rank that next to say compared to retirement or pretax savings was another thing that I think is a a great a great benefit And I I think it's really something that the the government ought to encourage more because there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in Germany and Japan Right When you have the when you have the the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has and you can offer some incentive and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up the savings and the that you wouldn't otherwise do and Leave You know I I don't think so yet They may have just plain parental leave which either one can take I their I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks Right and There There ought to be some compromise that could where where the person would be guaranteed a career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position in exchange for a longer period of time It's it's so important to families then and and yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up  That Yeah you're right I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I that I would most like to see changed the parental leave Right Right They do it by shortchanging their kids There's no other way unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely people moving as much And they just it's just a terrible choice you shouldn't have to make it you're right And right Boy would I like to have that Yeah listen I have friends in a lot of different cities If you just fly me there I'll take care of that Right So and I guess the
