Do you have a family budget or how do you work your budgeting Uh-huh Yeah well we don't have a real strict budget we have a a low budget to work on but we you know for like groceries we say about this much per week and then we just spend about so much We don't I I don't know of a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything but I know that I go to the grocery store that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there A certain amount Yeah Oh Wow that's great Oh you guys sound pretty self sufficient Huh Yeah Well that's a good idea Let's see the other thing there the topic was talking about was if if all I can think of is if you don't keep a real a real tight budget how do you control expenses but one another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas Well not fly back but somehow we get back there And this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive and Huh yeah And you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare And so we find that if we're careful with our you know just everyday things like grocery shopping and and gas and entertainment things like that then somewhere in out in the wash it will come out that we have enough to get back there You know Uh-huh that's all right Uh-huh Uh-huh that's right Yeah well whenever I don't know if this is part of the topic but whenever I find you know a dime or something on the ground I I'll probably pick it up Uh-huh yeah I have a special little jar that I keep all the money I found in You know just count it up at the end of the year something But yeah Uh-huh
