Before the one will take okay let's see I guess I can start I'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing Yeah so I'm looking at something larger than what we have We've got like an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and a an eighty-nine Horizon So I'm looking for something littler bigger yeah so we were thinking mini van for a while and we're looking at some just four door five passenger sedans as well I don't really have a preference either way I guess You know it's you know it I guess the American cars had a bad reputation but I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had Uh-huh Yeah Yeah e- even if it's just details it seems like they you know I j- there's a door seal that s- doesn't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while It's clearly just a a design problem there Uh-huh like a Miata or something like that  Interesting Yeah That's interesting Yeah I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for you know size and safety and then mileage Probably  Yeah Yeah I c- I think in terms of computer terminology I look at you know price performance and things like that And then a little bit at life expectancy I guess but it you know depends on what you what you pay initially But you know I've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton It's you know we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it so But  Uh-huh Yeah That's interesting But yeah it it's hard to beat some of the like I guess in particular we're looking at a like a ninety-one Corsica buy back at a they say G M sponsored auction but I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after you know it's after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you Yeah because I guess well ninety-two's granted but the new ones you know fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot so all the depreciation has been taken off and s- the dealer comes out okay you know I don't know what kind of I don't know what G M corporate kind of hit the I don't know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it and So but I don't know we keep looking at that mini van It's just you know we can get a like a Caravan for at twelve five but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now But it's interesting but I don't know if if it seems to be
