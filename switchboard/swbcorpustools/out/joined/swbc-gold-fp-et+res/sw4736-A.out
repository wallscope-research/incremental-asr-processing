Capital punishment I guess out in California is has had a lot of a lot of you know discourse in the paper apparently you know there's they haven't executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven I believe Yeah they Well I we were we we just started we lived in Redwood City when we were out there And and we found that you know it was a very liberal kind of community But the I I really feel that that the law enforcement community you know puts these people behind bars and then they they you know lawyers these lawyer groups get together and they they I think extend beyond the normal appeal process you know and just drag these this guy his his ultimate demise out for ten or fifteen years and I I think that that there's something that has to be changed in the system to to do that I think capital punishment was or probably stringent enough but I think the appeal process is really getting in the way Do do you feel as though there should be more was more you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by by capital punishment Uh-huh Well the term technicality The law enforcement community you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which grievous <> acts are done to to you know to get somebody into a a situation where they're going to be guilty of of a crime Or whether an- and whether the rights of that individual are been have been you know impuned but or whether there's just you know a policeman has just made a a you know a non a noncritical error though be it not the right way to do it but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a law breaker as being supportive Now I I'm a- a- at this juncture I you know I'm I'm not sure you know what constitutes a a technicality You know that that's what all c- these these hearings are about and that's what all these you know court cases are about our our our glorious you know mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of out of the can and you know he he tried to appeal his conviction and you know it didn't work But be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry in in the old days you know and say round about times of battle of Hastings you know and the villages if you were a transgressor they they either you know drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody and he you were his slave And if he didn't like what you did he killed you And that has that's pretty effective you know it's not good for civil rights I guess but it's pretty effective in that you know you've got to get along in the community and if you don't you'll perish Either by the hand of your your your master or by being pushed out in the woods So I I as as man has gotten more complicated so all of the imaginations to you know protect him from from being dumped on by civilian authority in in so- in criminal actions especially you know murder cases and that sort of thing Uh-huh
