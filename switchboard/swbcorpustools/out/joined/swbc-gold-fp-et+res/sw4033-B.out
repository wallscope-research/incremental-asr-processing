Well see I'm going to school right now and while I'm working I don't get a I don't get a chance to read the paper a lot and I don't watch T V as much really either because my free time is kind of and I do like to do other stuff with it While I'm at work sometimes I on the computer network I read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful That's true my roommates and stuff you know people around me talk about it And the people I work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff so Uh-huh Yeah Do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like the MACNEIL LEHRER HOUR really Uh-huh ch- see channel where I am channel eight's like public T V so it's kind of different I think I think the I think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but it seems that they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news Yeah Yeah exactly Uh-huh because they can they can only report on they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and r- and probably read something on it Yeah Yeah What kind of see I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of or like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that I wouldn't know about but other than that I don't really read I don't I don't really subscribe to anything else Uh-huh yeah Yeah Yeah Well I remember back during the during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on because that they were going constantly with that stuff But Yeah If they reported every if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour But yeah that's they start already they're having like in the newspaper they have a section I think every now and then on the Olympics you know and they've got like a countdown it's like sixteen hundred days or something really That's going to be crazy that time of year here But I can't believe they're they're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over I guess people want to hear about it Also big in the news right now is the Braves because they're they're in you know tr- spring training or whatever and they did so well last year Yeah It seems like I don't know they way they do the newscasts I wish they they kind of separated it you know if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it but I don't have cable
