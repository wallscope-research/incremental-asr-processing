Okay the question was about physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise Well I I don't do it as much as I should I try to walk And last year I would I did it every day but I've kind of in ninety-one I've kind of gone down hill And so I'm not doing it as much as I need to but I I can tell you when I do do it on a regular basis I feel so much better and so much healthier But it's just to get motivated to do it and once I get started and and I I I ca- I do it every night It's just to get motiv- motivated again and what happened about couple of weeks ago I started again And I was walking and it got kind of dark And I was by myself and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block And so I I kind of got frightened and I kind of use that as an excuse All I have to do is start earlier but I haven't walked since so Yeah it sure is It sure is How about you Do you exercise on a regular basis Uh-huh Oh Right Uh-huh Yeah it's once you get out of that habit you just don't you don't get back into it Because I teach school and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class We went in together and hired a private instructor and she came to our school twice a week And I I was I would go faithfully and then I missed once Then I went back again a couple times and missed another time and then kept missing and never went back again I think if you you just have to stick with it Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Sure yeah that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing Like it's misery loves company I don't really love exercise some I the neighbor across the street she goes belongs to President's and it's not President's any more I don't know what the name of it is anymore But she loves it it's just it's an automatic high for her She just enjoys it so much And I don't I feel good after I do it but I hate it when I'm doing it You know I just I don't enjoy it at all and she just loves it So Even when she doesn't go to the health club she runs you know And it's a daily thing for her So it you know and it's so hard for me I envy her I wish I could be that way but I don't I don't and I have an older sister that loves running too and she runs all the time but at to me it's every minute's agony and I in fact I don't run I hate to run Like when I walk I'll take along a radio or something and that helps you know pass the time Uh-huh uh-huh That's right Yeah yeah it's great afterwards yeah Yeah Yeah that's right Exactly it does it gives you energy Yeah It's kind of a vicious circle isn't it Yeah I find too that I have more energy when I exercise and you know it's silly not to but I don't know it's just a put off I don't know why I don't do more and I and I know that it's good for my health I know you know from everything that you read and you see on television now exercise is so important to good health So you know you not only you know you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit but you're probably prolonging your life So There's no reason that we shouldn't do it but I don't know Yeah Yeah Right Yeah Does it cost the same for just two nights or Well that's good too Yeah yeah That's right that's right Well do you have a facility right at the where you work No Yeah and then they hire private instructors that's great Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I can see that would be easy They make it as easy as they possibly can for you Well do a lot of people take advantage of it yeah Uh-huh you have a pool there too how nice Wow That's great Now to use Well does it cost money like to use the to exercise in the weight room or to to tak- to go swimming Do you have to pay for that too that's not bad Huh-uh  I think so too yeah Well and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics People of all ages take advantage of the aerobics
