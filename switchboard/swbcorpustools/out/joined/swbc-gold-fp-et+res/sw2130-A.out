All right I I would like to talk about just briefly What happened over there in Saudi Arabia in the political context I think it's refreshing to see the the support that the President got from the American people Right Right  Yes That's right Really Right Yeah That's great if if you remember the vote in the Congress to authorize war if necessary was actually pretty close And if if my memory serves me right I believe a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it it it was That's right Yeah Especially the ones that came out and said oh come on guys let's talk about this little while longer how many years are we going to wait and and what what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time No doubt I think so too Well they were and in fact they were so well dug in that when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time Well had had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor interesting Well Baker is really not very much pro Israel And did you know John Sununu is half Arab Yeah Right in in fact when he was Governor of New Hampshire I believe Okay I believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back And now he is a conservative but he is not a conservative that favors Israel and that that concerns me greatly Well they didn't have much choice they could either fight or die It is a positive thing however every time an organization such as the P L O says well we'll see if we can work with Israel then they get embarrassed some every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them And so you you basically have mutually exclusive interests either Israel is going to occupy the area or the Arabs are going to occupy the area and I'm just not sure that that there's going to be any easy permanent solution Exactly It is Yeah I I commend Israel for their restraint in not responding to the Scud attacks Yeah Exactly exactly No May not Well it's been fun I enjo- enjoyed talking with you You never know Bye bye
