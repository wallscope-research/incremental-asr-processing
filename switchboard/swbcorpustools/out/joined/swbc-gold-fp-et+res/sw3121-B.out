Well I think for me I I'm from Alabama South Alabama and so I grew up in the midst of civil rights movement in a pretty liberal family for for that area at the time And so I was very much a part of all the you know what was going on there my parents are pretty active and it was very scary and but now we've seen you know black people have a lot more civil rights in that area and I guess all over than they did you know twenty years ago There's still a lot to be you know to be accomplished but for me when I think about social change that's what I first think of because I can remember you know separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well that's true That's a good one right there Right And I grew up in out in the country too basically in a rural area and with lots of family And so we were always at family in different p- family members' homes But even now you know they don't even do that Well and they're so busy People people's personal schedules are so busy Mainly because I a lot of it has to do I think with more women working in our family you know twenty years ago not that many of the women worked And now almost all the women work And so that means you know a lot of a lot of the social visiting and all was I think probably instigated by women at that time Right And now That's right And now my mother does not work and and she you know she's f- finds herself pretty alone a lot because most of her friends are working women But even just social visits people don't do that anymore You're right And people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore There's a real Right you know you don't want to You want to make sure it's okay or I guess we don't not to make invade people's privacy or whatever Well out of out of fifteen grandchildren in my family only two of us don't live within fifty miles And th- and most live within ten or or twenty So but that's you know that is rural it's a rural family and most people didn't go away I'm just one of the two out of fifteen that don't live in the you know even in the same state Yeah There is in that area Uh-huh And I guess you know that would greatly affect social ch- i e social change Probably the job market has alwa- and the the economy has always affected social change Probably Well I think just also you know the women's movement too has affected a lot of social change people marry Yeah People marry later basically I think now again where I'm from in in Alabama that's not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school But now out here in Texas where I am now that's very unusual Most people get marrie- get go to college or at least get a job and even you know people are seem to a lot of people seem to be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up Right But probably you know more women being in in the work force also greatly greatly affects social change Because it affects child care and  Right Well and they're you know they're they're saying right now we don't know what we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties They are the first generation that basically grew up with day care And so you know it remained to be seen exactly what that what that does Uh-huh Where do they live Well they're not too far though Uh-huh Well I live like fourteen hours from home In fact I'm I'm driving tomor- I'm I'm driving home tomorrow so To go be there for the Fourth of July No I can drive it all It's just me So I can make it I'm thirty-five Although it's it's it is pretty I don't know I don't enjoy it that much It's pretty much like get there and It's just not that pleasant Even with other people I basically just don't like to drive that far Uh-huh When you say you're in the second phase of this project what is the second phase of it Oh
