Okay so Right What what  No I I'm in well I live in Richardson Texas and Yeah And but grew up in Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of lawn and garden work and Yeah No So not not growing up familiar with here when I get a chance I listen to that Neil Sperry and do that And Yeah  Yeah Don't do any any gardening in the sense of vegetable gardening but Tr- tr- tried some tried some different flowers and and bushes and stuff and have a have a lawn service There was one when we when we bought the house and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one but in terms of the fertilizing and weed control mainly leave that up to them What about you Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Well <> Well good Yeah No Yeah Yeah What what what kind of a is this some sort of a disease or is it a pest What Well what kind what kind of trees are they Huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah Well that's that's one thing that we a- we've had very poor luck with with is in in our yard is is trees but the what what trees were were there when we moved in were had been put in by the developer when he built the house and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree I think And figured up last night at there were seven different trees of of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in and we got one left at this point but a couple of them we've lost to the w- weren't too good trees we've lost to wind Three we three we've lost to to freezes between eighty-three and and then a year ago we lost another one Well d- Yeah we- we didn't ha- we didn't have any that were that that big when they went two o- two of them the wind the wind blew over in in terms of getting them down the Yeah Yeah Now th- the one that the one that we lost the last one that we lost a a year ago u- up until then they do- hadn't been big enough but what I just used a hand saw and sawed them off at at as close close to ground level as I could and then got s- got some chemical that drill holes and pour in that helps helps rot the stump ki- yeah stump killer and stump stump rotter But this last one had a fair sized root and some guy was doing a job in the neighborhood and and saw it and stopped in and asked if I didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty-five bucks and I said fine He had he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that and it yeah and it it just it just ripped it right out and I took the i- it left the it left he left the chips and I put them up mulch ar- around around the other shrubs and had had a pile of dirt from various things back by the garage that I filled in with and and it's filling in with with grass nicely this year so that that was that was worth it but Yeah Yeah but Yeah well y- do you do your own lawn in terms of mowing Yeah yeah Yeah I yeah I I I we just got a a old push Sears mower I it's been fifteen years now since we first moved to Texas we've had it and I keep waiting for it to die but every year it just seems to hang on and and I do it my do it myself But yeah we- a year a year ago I took into took it into Sears to have it tuned up for the season and they said no it's it's too old we won't even work on it And I took it back home and it's can't kept plugs along But But my son's o- one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have <>
