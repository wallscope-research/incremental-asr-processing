Well the one I think is interesting is the California Los Angeles police chief who says he won't resign And did you hear yesterday that Mayor Bradley said that he should I think it's I think what's interesting is that the political activists Jesse Jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating I find it interesting that outsiders would bother to go in How do how do you feel about people like Jesse Jackson getting involved Well do you but do you think Gates should resign Well well speaking of that kind of issue have you kept up with John Wiley Price What do you think of him He's an interesting person I was talking to someone who said that for all his obvious attention to efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the I guess he's on the County Board of Supervisors or and the the the at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker and is really quite agreeable and that this stuff we see in the you know in the media is well he's really just trying to make a political statement I I find that an interesting element of politics that we don't that that most people would not know that John Wiley Price apparently is a is a you know of course he's got in this this deal of racism and the you know name calling and all this But apparently he's a a worker you may disagree with him but I I I find this whole what do you think of this fourteen one and ten four one in Dallas I agree with you but did you see the map they drew up on on how they were going to divide up the districts It was it was the strangest I'm I'm not sure it was gerrymandered but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff I I I guess I'm a little cynical of the of the power base I I I and I don't quite understand why the power base doesn't why they don't go with fourteen one I you know and you know the it seems to me that what happened in the in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly the the I think it's Hispanics don't vote because they don't think that they have any affect and it's I I guess I am disappointed with Dallas in that the fourteen one it I don't know You can you can disagree with Al Lipscomb and what's what's the lady's name Yeah You can disagree with what they're doing and what they're saying but in reality I think they're they're trying to represent their constituents A- and I think Dallas is doing itself a disservice I think they ought to get on with something important Yeah and I but I think even I even those people are it's like Pauken and Box and these people I think it's it's kind of interesting that everybody's so busy politicking that the question is are we getting anything good done It's like this whole school issue Are you involved in the schools at all public schools This whole thing down there where they're they're trying to you know devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools and and it all seems you know like everybody's trying to one-upmanship on everybody else so I I have got to run to a meeting It was good talking to you I don't think we've gone our our ten minutes but I think we've we've talked long enough Okay Good night
