not at all In fact I'm graduating from college in about a week and this past semester I've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials I think I think s- the system right now you know should you know is fine I think it should be by a jury I don't think the judge should have he's just there kind of like the referee I don't I don't even think that it should be unanimous either Uh-huh Right Exactly Uh-huh I don't know I you you rarely hear you hear of course there's cases where someone has been put in in in prison falsely accused but more than likely the people that are on the the jury know what they're doing you Never Well you would think that they would get that in the when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out and I I know they automatically when you go through when you're chosen is you're automatically like a a a professor in criminal justice or something like that that you're automatically no they don't want you on the jury Exactly Uh-huh exactly  Uh-huh Uh-huh I've I've never I've never even been called to jury duty Yeah I <> I don't know I think the I guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Ri- I I do- I I don't think the judge should just make the decision alone Least with the jury you have twelve people you know that are going to decide you know you're the the person's fate This really is part of utt1  Exac- judge Right exactly Probably yeah Yeah But no it's it's sad though that that the people though that you you somebody's life is in twelve people's hands and sometimes those twelve people could care less And or they fool the the defense in thinking that they're you know because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want Exactly Uh-huh yeah Well I guess it's just that maybe people are you know upset at court you know If it was if it was a a family member of theirs though that was innocent and then they'd want to be on that jury But if everyone would take it I think if everyone took it seriously and something you have to do This really seems to be just a continuation of B68 not an indep slash unit  Yeah I would love to be called I'm ready to go They just haven't called me up yet It was nice talking to you Bye-bye
