Yeah I'm trying to think what I've seen lately we- well we just finished watching TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on tape you know Yeah we we've seen that yeah Yeah it was great have you seen it Yeah I We we saw an we liked it but you know I didn't think it was as good as all the hype was about it Yeah I don- I I couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for best picture Yeah yeah and so we just it depends you know it depends on wh- I'd like to see those I keep you know you know there's like three movies that I I keep telling myself that I should see one of these you know some day that I haven't seen you know that that are classics you know Because I've never seen CITIZEN KANE and never seen I've never seen CASABLANCA and never seen GONE WITH THE WIND Uh-huh I I def- we saw part of THE AFRICAN QUEEN on on T V a couple of years ago and I've I've alwa- I've been wanting to see all of it but we just you know we walk into the video store and we're like well why don't we go see this now so But I think- one of the movies we saw recently we saw MISERY That was good it was great And it you think you know for a Stephen you know it because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory but there's only one well there's a couple scenes at at the end there's there is you know some blood and everything and there's one really bad scene where it's there's not blood but it's pretty graphic But it's it's a really good movie Yeah yeah he's a writer and she's his biggest fan and she's also a little a little on the nutso side No we haven't it wasn't Oka- I I got I heard like mixed reviews of that we s- That's that's on our list of things to see N- our big thing is you know mo- movie prices up here I think it's like six bucks now in the theaters you know So it's like you know a lot of things we try to catch like at the dollar theater or matinees and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape Ye- well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was EDWARD SCISSORHANDS Yeah have you seen that it was great Yeah it was No no it's it's an odd film and it's really interesting that I like the director a lot a guy named Tim Burton Did you ever see the movie BEETLEJUICE ok- se- yeah well if you if you liked BEETLEJUICE you'll probably like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS if you didn't like BEETLEJUICE you'll probably won't like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS Yeah it's Burton's kind of e- he's a very odd odd man but he's I think he's very interesting and I liked those two movies of his a lot He did BATMAN also which you know It was good but he was Yeah yeah Yeah don't really know I like Costner a lot but I'm a big I'm a big baseball fan so you know after BULL DURHAM and FIELD OF DREAMS you know although you know Which one Yeah FIELD OF DREAMS was good and I I think I liked the other movies he's done NO WAY OUT was really good and did you ever see SILVERADO let's see Danny Glover Scott Glen Kevin Kline Brian Dennehy Jeff Goldblum's in John Kreas is in it if you don't blink It was it was a big western I think Roseanne Arquett was in it too another one that if you blink you'd miss her it was and I think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours and and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out but it was it was really good Uh-huh No I didn't is that any good okay Yeah we were in the video store today and somebody was recommending it to somebody You know the the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else well I'll have to catch it one of these days You sa- you you said you seen NO WAY OUT Yeah that was very good he was in THE UNTOUCHABLES too Yeah it was on no it was on one of the networks I think last weekend or two weeks ago Yeah I I wish I'd seen it when when you know it was originally in the theaters and I saw it you know I saw part of it again I like you know I like Costner I like Sean Connery and there's this one there's this one actor it's really silly that I enjoy him a lot but I I've really enjoyed him in everything I've seen him in a guy named Charles Martin Smith you've probably seen him and just an you know that's who the guy is Do you remember did you ever see AMERICAN GRAFFITI Oh Did you ever see the movie STAR MAN Okay in STAR MAN he was the guy chasing after Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen or Nancy Allen You know w- short nerdy guy with glasses He's he's just I I don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in He was in the UNTOUCHABLES He was the accountant Yeah No no you're thinking of Rick Moranis He looks like Rick Moranis but he's not Yeah Yeah a little of e- e- a review usually won't make me go see a movie I hadn't already wanted to see No it's o- I want to see it we want to see GODFATHER PART THREE also but my my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago but I've never seen either of the first you know of the of the GODFATHER movies so we're probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere Yeah okay I haven't never read it Uh-huh We just rented a couple weeks ago a movie called THE FRESHMAN with it's got Matthew Broderick in it and Marlon Brando And Brando like does a parody of the character he played in THE GODFATHER yeah it's it's one of the reasons why you know THE GODFATHER's been on our minds lately but there's a bunch of scenes from from THE GODFATHER that's used because Matthew Broderick's going to film school And in his classes they're using there's a bun- they're running a bunch of scenes from THE GODFATHER and then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing you know this Maf- you know this organized crime head So it's it was it was a fun movie  I liked RAINMAN I thought I thought it was interesting that he was doing som- Yeah well I'm being from Baltimore of course I'm a big Barry Levinson fan since he he's you know he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies n- Barry Levinson did DINER and TINMAN and AVALON which are all set in Baltimore Uh-huh Ye- we- Ye- of the three of those DINER's probably the best they're they're all pretty good but DINER is really worth seeing late fifties yeah Okay and
