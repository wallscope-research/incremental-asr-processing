I generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap we have four but most of them are gone now so there there might be but we were taking you know four five and six people out Yes I'm in Texas And we live- we lived in Ohio prior to this slash error we were up near Cleveland slash error should be 'sd' Yeah but I look for service even at the quickie places type things I don't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong and then you're stuck and it's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave so I really don't like the drive-thrus that much I I like to go and eat there But I would say service atmosphere and whether the food is good and on going out I like steaks So we try to hit those places when we can Uh-huh Yeah slash error yeah slash error should be 'b' and in in in the countries unless it's a large city I guess Dairy Queen and Wal-Mart are their main That's what you find right My husband likes Dairy Queens He likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs I guess so he's a fan of of Dairy Queen and and we'll go even in town here at times just as a a change although I'm not that excited about it But we've eat we eat out so much it's gotten so I don't like to really eat any place but yet I hate to cook food at home so that might be why I look for inexpensive places just because we're eating out probably five nights a week maybe Or we eat junk food at home now my husba- we'll go to them all We sort of take turns And we I sort of favor the ones if I have a coupon we can go there and if not we can't because it's cheaper so mine is monetarily I guess strongly monetarily based we'll go get pizza and at Little Caesar's although the kids prefer Domino's Right But it's just a lot cheaper than than Domino's so that's We go to Grandy's quite a bit I would say McDonald's we've sort of been off of that for a while and no particular reason and I maybe we avoided Wendy's the last few years because our daughter worked there and she never wanted us to show up there so I don't we don't go there that much A nice meal It's usually when we're out of town and I'll order steak or steak and lobster combined so it's really not in town No Uh-huh Uh-huh Right But well we don't go out that much I gue- well I guess we do go out without kids We're usually picking things up quickly though we just don't dwell on food too much and with my husband traveling he can get all he needs of that during the week going to those places so it doesn't really matter to him He'd probably just like to stay home Well I think I I never have liked to cook food but I think it all began eating out when we had the boys in in different baseball on baseball tea- it was mainly baseball teams and my husband would coach so we were never home at the same time I'm not one that's going to fix you know the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they're there If there not there in between five and six well then I guess we don't eat today sp:they're or you go you know you fend for yourself You go somewhere else So that you know that really snowballed when we got down here when I started to sub make money I went well I'll just sub to slash error: two utts So that you know that really snowballed when we got down here when I started to sub make money I went well I'll just sub to slash error: two utts
