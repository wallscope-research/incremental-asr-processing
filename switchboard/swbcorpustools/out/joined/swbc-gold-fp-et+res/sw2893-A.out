So Yeah I sure do I ride a bicycle quite a bit and work out with free weights I live right near White Rock Lake so I used to I try to ride about ten to twenty miles a day But I haven't been doing so well this year but that's weird yeah So what's your motivation Yeah Was it for health or to look good I was think It was just a side benefit Yeah Up to a point Yeah Yeah so what was what was the other question let's see do you do it as a task or do you enjoy enjoy working out Yeah I think I I enjoy it sometimes and there's other times when I just get tired of it and and I feel like I'm obligated to do it because I've been doing it so I should keep up And there's some days it's just like it's the hardest thing in the world to to get started I'm twenty-seven Yeah still young getting older Yeah but Yeah Right Right Yeah I notice if you if you stay in shape you don't age as bad I think too I was I go to school too at night and last semester I had stopped working out 'cause I hurt myself and started smoking a lot and you just those kind of things age you more Right an right an you can't and then you know it just kind of feeds itself You smoke and then you don't work out because you Right and so I finally quit because like I just all I was doing was going down hill fast Yeah Right back to them Yeah that's Yeah yeah I went to health club a few years ago and now I work out at home because I don't really my schedule with school and work I don't have time to get down to one There used to be one that was a twenty-four hour that I used to go to but I actually prefer to work out alone Really Yeah I wouldn't mind having you know working out with a friend and and stuff but when you get into some of these some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait You know I like to start get it done and get out of there No I'm not Yeah Right especially having a kid I guess tends to just gain weight because you have to to to Just have to start all over Right Yeah some people are a little bit fanatical about it You know I Well yeah and about working out and fitness you know I like to to work out to look good and stay in shape and you know I know it's good for me but people that live for it and you know eat a bunch of different pills and all that kind of stuff it gets a little bit obsessive Yeah Yeah Steroids Yeah there's really bad for you Hem- hormones Yeah it's too dangerous Yeah I had a friend whose brother did steroids and as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out It all turned to fat and he just really looked bad But I don't know if it does to everybody he was i- it just that's how it affected him And he I don't know just Yeah At least you got a chance to out run them that way I don't like to run myself I've thought about it several times and I just it I like to move a little faster and cover more ground It's probably I would think it would be hard on your your legs and your joints and stuff Yeah I can't Yeah No you can't it's dangerous At least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could but a regular ten speed with those skinny tires you slide all over the place Yeah Yeah well Well good luck with the the new kid All right
