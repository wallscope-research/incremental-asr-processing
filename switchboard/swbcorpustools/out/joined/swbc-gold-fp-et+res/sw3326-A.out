Okay My children are all grown up Uh-huh I'll bet I'll bet it is What is the favorite thing you do with your children Uh-huh You just watch them play I I tried it once or twice but I didn't feel like I was very good at it either My grandson got me to one day but Different worlds and how do you get to another world you know And I I don't even know what they're talking about Do you Yeah I know when our kids were growing up our we were big into water sports We had a boat and they all skied and in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing and they always took other friends with them and we had a lot of fun doing that but I had all girls so we didn't do too much sports wise I find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball and little boys do all of those things but Uh-huh I'll bet you really are Uh-huh Uh-huh Well when mine were real little they all played soccer but you know that was just for a couple of years when they were pretty small for girls and then they got more interested in other things I'm not sure that they would admit it at that age that it was boys but I think that's probably what it was Uh-huh But they but you enjoy them I think the older mine get the more I enjoy them Uh-huh And I didn't it wasn't that I didn't like them when they were little but the older they got I enjoyed them as teenagers And now that they're each of course three girls they're each becoming the they've all become women in themselves that it's been neat to watch them How what kind of mothers they are what kind of wives you know How they do things and Two of them live real close to me So we we spend a lot most of our time spent with them is they come over to eat And bring the kids and we play with the kids you know But Where d- we go camp out they camp out and we spend weekends at the in the country with them quite a bit but as far as doing any activity now that the grand kids are here we all just stay around the house mostly It's too much effort to go somewhere with all the kids Uh-huh They'll always remember it too I hear mine saying well I remember mother and daddy used to take us to do so and so I need to take my boys to do this or that you know And I remember the year we went to Disneyworld as quick as my kids are big enough we're going to go to Disneyworld You know Yeah they just really can't wait to be able to take their kids where they had fun But Do you work Uh-huh It really does The time you have with them has to be quality time then I imagine that they have some a lot of homework too Uh-huh uh-huh Well there's just so many things to do with them nowadays though and especially if they're active kids Like you say you bowl
