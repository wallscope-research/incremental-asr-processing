Okay wow I don't know what that was I don't know Uh-huh yes Uh-huh we have not camped in any of those places in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped but we used to go to Tyler State Park and Daingerfield and in Texas that is where we camp basically They are very nice Tyler is really really a neat place to camp It has a nice little lake and it has some really wonderful sights that are in the wooded areas the facilities are quite nice and our children liked liked it quite well the kids are well they are quite a bit younger than should be 'then' and you know they we felt real safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area And it was just it was just a really nice place to camp now Daingerfield is let's see I think that's a little bit mor- more east further east and and maybe south if I am remembering where that is No I think it's a little bit further north when I think about it At any rate it was it was very nice as well But Tyler we sort of got spoiled with I think But we had lived in Michigan before we came here and had done a lot of camping in Michigan I think the upper peninsula of Michigan especially and then also we had done some camping in Colorado in the mountains so my parents were real avid campers and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well So I guess we just kind of came by it naturally Do you have a large tent or Uh-huh And how many does it sleep comfortably Right Yeah Well sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger we invested in some stacking cots you know that were like bunk bunk beds but they were cots fold up cots That really gave us a lot more space floor space and so you did not have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around and gave us a place to stack things during the day so that was real nice But we like my in-laws also had a camper or a pop up tent you know one of those trailer tops and those are really nice too A little more luxurious so to speak but not much Yes uh-huh It's really nice in fact it even had had a little refrigerator and the whole business It was quite nice in that respect and everything was very convenient and you did not have to to be hauling things out of your the trunk of you car and that was nice So do you have plans for for any other camping trips in the near future Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Right yes Yes yes I have been in that area That is a really pretty state park just we did not camp there but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area and it's real lovely It's close to the lake and close to I think it's close to the dam up there so it's it's really quite pretty are you let's see what was I was going to ask you something else do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to Yeah uh-huh is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in the State of Texas I I would I have never been there and I would love to see what it looks like Uh-huh I see How interesting I guess I never heard the history of that well that might be some place where my husband and I can go We are talking about starting camping again in the fall our children are both grown and and so it's just pretty much the two of us who do things And so we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to to go to and see what it looks like Yeah yeah Is it yeah I think so Especially with when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty especially in East Texas it's really nice So well I I have enjoyed talking with you And have some happy camping trips Hope you get to those places you have talked about Well okay thanks Uh-huh bye-bye
