Okay You can go first or I will Okay Well I'm going to tell you what I'd have Down in the south we have a lot of shrimp okay And I have shrimp that is steamed in beer that I cook And then I have a cauliflower that I would cook garlic bread green salad tea and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert Yes And what's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your like your rice steamer your rice cooker And you place the shrimp in the in the rice steamer and you put a bay leaf and put some red pepper over it Now you can either use you know the kind that comes in the little can or you can just get some you know regular red peppers Cayenne Uh-huh And you put a little bit of that over it Now if you use the dried kind Then you would only use two of them And you put that in there and then you pour two bottles of beer over it Two pounds That's the jumbo shrimp in the shells Leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up And you pour the beer over the top of it and you cover it And you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil and the shrimp turn pink Then you remove it and you put it on a platter And then you serve it with melted butter And I usually put garlic powder in mine And they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it But then the mi- the cauliflower you cook that in the microwave And what you do is you just wash it and you core it And in a like a what do you call it Like Pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave Uh-huh But it's got to have one that has a cover on it And you put about two tablespoons of water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt And then you just set your cauliflower in there and then you cook it for seven minutes on high And you rotate it one time Uh-huh Y- when you core it you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off And you just set it in there and you microwave it on high for seven minutes and you turn it one time And while that's cooking I take mayonnaise about a cup of mayonnaise and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder and I mix it all together And I shred up some just regular white cheese And after that's cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that And you cook it for another three minutes on high you know just mainly to melt the cheese and everything and let all the seasoning melt into it And it's done It is good But it it looks what you can do then see is like what I usually do is I'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle and then I put the shrimp around the outside of it you know on my platter And then I have a green salad that I put around the outside of that And you know you have all the different seasonings and stuff and then I just fix little individual cups for them And they have the garlic bread and it makes it a real nice looking you know Huh-uh huh-uh But it looks like it you know You look like you went to a whole bunch Right And usually I cut those little cherry tomatoes up and put some color into it you know and I'll lay those on top of my salad you know to make it look nice and things like that Okay it usually serves six Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Have you ever had crawfish You ought to try some crawfish They are good But see that's one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over you know even if it's like out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking You know they want it from down here Because just like now especially crawfish it is starting to move out you know and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is But it's similar Uh-huh Yeah It's not exactly it's got a taste of its own you know but it is it is similar to because you only eat the tails of it it looks more like a crab Uh-huh But No let me think of I can't even think of what you I guess if it it looks like more like a cross between a crab and and a lobster Because it's small like that and it's got the pinchers like a crab But you know it's it's similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a lobster would And we call them mud bugs But they're fantastic tasting They are so good Everybody it's it's the season for them right now Louisiana yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yes You know You buy it you buy it as a seasoning Huh-uh Huh-uh I cook mine well do you have a like a black iron skillet okay Well I guess you could cook it in in that too but I don't know You know I never have I use the black iron skillet to cook mine Uh-huh But it really it's not it it it doesn't burn or anything like that The blackening is really the seasoning there is it's it's a blackening seasoning You know that is a seasoning That's really it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time or something like that to get it Because it's called what it's called is Blackening Magic And it it comes in a bottle and Well I'm trying to see It's got a a picture of Dom De Luise on it Uh-huh Right Uh-huh But Uh-huh Yeah But you do have to have it you know you do have to have it hot when you cook it your pan It does have to be really hot you know when you put it in But it's not like it's burned and it what it what blackens it is the seasoning And it is so good Oh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well have you ever thought about coming to Louisiana you know to visit Yeah You ought to come down you don't even have to go all the way to New Orleans you know if you want to really get some good food you don't have to go that far south But of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as I'm concerned And fact is we're going to take a vacation this year We're going to go to New Orleans again And we're only going down there for the food though yeah We go to the the French Quarters and stuff like that And I have some friends that live down there And so usually we go to we don't go to the tourist ones We go to the ones that they tell us to go to you know And we went to this one it was called The Back Porch And they were cooking the stuff you know while we were we went on this boat ride And then we came back and ate out on this it was like a back porch And usually if you can find somebody <> Of course now when you go down there you know they've got just there's no where you can miss I have never gone to a restaurant and not just been so full it's unreal it's so good The seasoning they it's just unreal Gumbo No gumbo Uh-huh Right Uh-huh You can even make it with chicken or you can make it with seafood Uh-huh Uh-huh And I'll tell you what
