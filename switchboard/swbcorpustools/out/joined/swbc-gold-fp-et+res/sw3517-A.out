Okay I'm in Dallas Texas What about yourself Okay Uh-huh No I've lived here for almost five years now And I'm a before that I was at school in Rochester New York and I'm originally from Boston That's right but I like it Well I missed it at first but now I go back there and I'm a real wimp about the cold So I like it here It's nice Uh-huh Uh-huh I know tell me where that is I I probably do know but I don't know it by that name Okay Sure okay yeah I know that area That's a nice area that's quite a range Uh-huh yeah Well I am I'm gosh I'm barely in Dallas I'm just north of Addison Airport up on the tollway And I guess we have a similar situation we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy eighty thousand and then we've got Bent Tree right across the street so I don't I don't even know how high those go but some of those are pretty big Yeah So it's that's the strange thing about I guess Dallas because back where I'm from you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all They'd all be pretty similar to one another within a a couple miles So Yeah Uh-huh yeah I've noticed that Uh-huh we've got a house let's see we moved in about four years ago and it was it had previously been unoccupied but it had existed for three years This is a whole block of homes that a builder built all of them and I guess he he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away type of deal So the whole block was all foreclosed And so some were vacant for quite a while before they you know they finally sold them because there were so many Yes no the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open But yeah So we just you know we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that And we're really we haven't had any problems and you know we had originally thought we'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything But the prices are much lower here and this was definitely not a fix up special but I'll tell you it takes all my time Between we put in our own sprinkler system and I just finished repainting the exterior and you know making drapes and buying furniture it's just a money pit Really is So <> Uh-huh Uh-huh no
