Well right at the present time nothing real special I kind of like gardening and I'm kind of into camping and you know vacationing that sort of thing I don't have any real serious okay I think you're Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Really yeah I kind of enjoy doing that a little bit too No I I guess if you make money at it it becomes a vocation Yeah I guess as far north as you are if you like gardening you've still got a couple months to go haven't you Uh-huh yeah that's right you would yeah In cold frames or whatever the Uh-huh  Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I've I've lived in in Texas and New Mexico most of my life but I did once I spent one winter in North Dakota and I I remember that it was on into May before it really started warming up and yeah Okay because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit Yeah You're at Yeah You're right across the lake from what Plattsburgh Yeah yeah Yeah I had I had a cousin that was stationed there Plattsburgh for a while He he remembers lots of snow really slash error Yeah slash error should be 'b' Yeah Yeah well I'm I'm working for T I Texas Instruments down here yeah  Oh yeah Yeah we're getting to where we're straying I guess yeah Uh-huh yeah Yeah yeah the they s- it's sold in the hobby stores and nurseries It's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it but Yeah I didn't realize what it was for a while I'd walk into a room where some of that and I'd wonder what is that you know and then one day I I realized that it was eucalyptus Yeah Is that the stuff that koala bears eat in Australia or something Maybe that's why they're so slow I guess they're stoned on the stuff or something Yeah yeah Yeah that's that's a big step yeah Yeah slash error Yeah slash error should be 'b' Uh-huh shapers and planers and routers There was a program on T V down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little little companies of one and two guys you know up there espec- this particular one I think was in Maine and New Hampshire where out in the just kind of out in these little towns they'd be in they may be the same kind of people you're talking about You know they've they've got twelve weeks to do something and they they're making furniture and just you know things like that during the winter and then they go off and do other things during the summer So yeah Yeah yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah That would be really t- you know like say the man yeah Yeah yeah that's that's something Now our temperatures down here we're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties and so and so as far as you know planting outdoor stuff matter of fact tonight I just got through I was planting some some trees out back tonight and this is it's really nice out tonight Almost hated to come you know Yeah these were trees that that wintered I do- don't know where they came from They come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri and places like that And they come down here and they'll sit in the nurseries here and they'll go ahead and and leaf out So what I'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that's trees that are already leafed out Yeah Mostly I think in a place where it's really cold they do it in the fall let them winter you know through the fall but down here well it's done both ways It it just kind of depends on what you're what you're planting but all the shrubs and Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Flowers during the summer down here the the normal kind of flowers there's very few of them that will really do well Everything does real well here in the spring until about first part of June and then the re- the heat sets in And June July August are you know most of the those kind of plants just are just barely staying alive let alone make flowers we're in a relatively new area We're kind of out of the natural tree area We're kind of up on a on a higher on a slope So we don't have where we are right now there are very few trees This was this was this was pasture land but down the down the hill here a little ways there are parks that are look like jungles you know They're really Uh-huh Now where is this In Georgia yeah yeah Well I tell you what now see East Texas there's two parts of Texas East Texas and North Texas Atlanta and Dallas are almost identical in every way weather and everything The two cities are very very identical so if you were familiar with Atlanta well no it's it's not dry at all It it's humid Hu- Houston is awful Houston is really humid No
