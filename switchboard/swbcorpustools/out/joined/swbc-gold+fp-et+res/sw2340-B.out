Hello Fine I'm Callie in Garland Yes Oh are you Yeah you I know I know they It was a lot nicer than I expected I've talked to I don't think they were students one I think worked at a university university um and the furthest away I've talked to someone has been New York Yes we are Oh well that's a did you push the button Did we Okay just in case Now what Oh Oh Well isn't that neat Isn't that neat Uh-huh Oh that's good That's neat Just supervised more or less than anything and security I guess Oh Uh-huh What made you all decide to put her what made her decide to go Right Well that's good That's great Uh-huh Right Shut-ins and Yeah it really is I worked in one as a teenager I volunteered Well it was really it was really sad heartbreaking I guess And uh I just oh I just felt for those people especially the ones that never got visited That just bothered me That just bothered me so much especially you know at my age I was probably about fourteen And that really made a bad impression on me I always thought not really bad of them because they are most of them I believe are probably pretty good for the people but I don't know It's just a it would be a tough tough decision Right Helps yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Right Right Right Yeah and get that youth back You know sometimes that even helps them just being around young people to because some of them are so um just stationary they'll get in a wheelchair or they'll just sit in a chair and and until you come along and really try and pump them up they're just stationary and I feel like gosh that's all they do all day long So I do love to see young kids go and and men take the pets and everything I think that's a real real neat idea Yeah That's Yeah Right Right Stagnant Yeah that's exactly right I think they're really neat Um of course I've seen those reports on T V the horrible ones and that scares me It's sad to think that we would do that to people and you know I've seen them on T V with uh bed sores and oh they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry And I just think how can you do that These people have given so much of their lives you know to to America you know whatever and here is how we treat them Just put them in a home and leave them Uh-huh <> Right I think Right I think it's neat I think uh you learn a lot from them from all their experiences and and that's one of my favorite things to do is sit around and listen to their stories I think that's neat because they really have a lot of good i- insights that my fa- my husband's father is really old He he had him late in life and he's he'll be eighty this year And I just uh he lives with different you know people in the family He'll switch from time to time I just Yeah I just couldn't imagine locking not locking him up but putting him in a home and just Lock him up I know I know Right exactly That's right Oh you're going to put me away That's what my mother she always You're going to lock me up one day aren't you I can tell you're going to lock me up I know Right That's great Gosh Right Yes Prepare your Well that's great Now can she leave um on a day by herself Oh man That's neat Right Right I know bless their hearts you hate to hurt them by doing that that's like their one last thing that they can still do and you take away that driving ability and that would really be hard We've Well we've thought about doing that for my husband's father because he Yeah Well luckily he drives a big old tank So he I don't think he he could get hurt I just hope to God he doesn't ever hurt anyone But he he hasn't had any accidents luckily Yeah yeah I saw that on TWENTY TWENTY They um you know they're testing that they're you know thinking of doing that And I think that would be a great idea because I think they do come become less aware and they just I don't know they and they don't hear as well for one thing and that doesn't help Right At least that way the burden is not on the family of taking their license or their car away It's on the state
