All right I I think our experience of camping is I I am the the passive member I get things ready and then I enjoy Uh because my my husband is a good camper and so they he manages the troops and they do the work and I have fun That's when we camped the most When I thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because uh I it seems like I would go through a period of time where I just uh was really overworked you know and and getting out into nature and relaxing and having the family do a good share of the work you know and the part that I did was more fun than uh than labor because they did the the running and toting chores and I just helped cook and kind of organize you know It is isn't it It isn't Ha- what kinds of things have you tried Have you done uh uh uh the big pot cooking Oh yeah Big frying p- Oh that's interesting You know interesting enough uh the food part was kind of uh important thing in our camping Uh when my oldest son uh always at the beginning I did all the shopping and everything But the the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his uh uh cooking merit badge in and and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff and uh you know he did it up really good And so uh after he took that merit badge he did all the shopping and preparing getting ready for it It was it was a marvelous experience because after that then all I had to do was uh follow the instructions you know and do And we did a lot of interesting kinds of things like I would take corn bread and uh cook a pan inside of a pan over a over a camp uh stove And it works real good It's like an oven Just put uh put a thing on it What did you like to do most That's neat isn't it Right I agree Huh Well now in Florida is ther- is there ti- are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot Uh-huh Oh is that true Now now we're we're in Texas now and you're in Texas right Okay uh we have not camped a great deal here because uh a good share of the time in the Summer time it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping I gue- Yeah yeah we have done that But but we camped mostly when the kids were little we were in we were in New Jersey and w- Uh in uh Allendale and uh and uh Waldwick it's just about twelve miles south of the New York border And we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp and it was so you know pick your own uh blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast Uh also go ahead Oh are you Where did you live Oh oh yeah I know that I had a cousin who lived in White Plains that's a that's a neat area But it's a that is a particularly neat area for camping because Yeah it is neat though because there are lots of lakes fairly near by you don't have to go very far And uh and there's uh a lot of trees lot of mountains and lot of uh hiking sort of things and and we had uh collapsible boat which we clipper little clipper sail boat And so we would sail and and uh did a lot of camping that way Oh do you We've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis and it's fun too I think Do you That's neat so you kind of uh uh an everyday camper A full time camper Well now are you living alone now or You and your dog huh Hey that sounds great Well we don't we don't camp quite as much as we used to but uh I still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family and enjoy nature and uh kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life I'd always right I'd always come home just relaxed and uh comfortable and ready to go at it again so it was a neat activity Good to talk to you Tell me your name again Jack all right Ye- yes we've been here we're we're in Plano but we've been here about uh eighteen years Are you are you how about that Well we're all lots of people from T I up this way All right good to talk to you All right all right bye-bye
