Oh o- Oh okay What building do you work in Oh okay Okay Oh okay Okay I've only made a few Um Okay our topic for today is invasion of privacy So I got a good one When the phone rings and you've got a recording and this always happens like around five or six o'clock at night It rings and you get this recording and then it won't go away and any any of the type of solicitation that where they call all the time you know There are evenings especially Friday nights Thursday and Friday nights Well we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night More people call that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall you know your sitting down to eat and the phone rings and it's like I don't want anything thank you very much Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah Yeah that's that's real irritating to me Uh-huh They can leave their whole spiel on it Huh Yeah I yeah that's that's a high irritant for me Drives me crazy And it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times these computer things will just make up numbers at random and just call them And so it really really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not you know you have a unlisted number or not And they pass around uh cards that have everybody's name on it Like if you order something through a mail order catalog you know then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in And a bunch of stuff and a bunch of stuff because they sell their customer list or they sell their catalog list of people to different companies and everything Right Right Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah Oh yeah Let's see I'm trying to think Oh have you heard that that I'm trying to think of what company it was there was a company that was going to uh be giving out information about your financial status Well um I work in the computer science center and so we hear a lot about things that are that computers are capable of doing And uh this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have X amount of million peoples financial history and information on it And they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera et cetera And uh they finally uh stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused because it was such a big deal And I wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either there was a lot of stuff going on about it Okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh Uh-huh Huh Uh-huh Well that's real interesting I know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need on several things and you know your credit ap and th- all all they ever need you to do is give them permission to to pull a credit thing on on yourself and there it is That's all they really care about They just want that credit history to see if you're a person If you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that Uh-huh Oh I know that there's several people I've talked to that really have a problem with it and I'm former military so you get kind of used to to going through stuff like that You know you don't pay any attention to it once you sign over your soul to Uncle Sam you know you just kind of kind of blow it off but So I think I think the people who have who have been down that route or have had it to deal with anything like that have learned you know it's just one of those things You just do it and be done with it and don't worry about it But I do know that there are several sites I didn't I wasn't aware that Austin was one of them but I think Johnson City was one Yeah there's there's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue And the but also on things that I'd heard too from a stockholders meeting was that there were people uh there were the same places where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh I don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and on an individual basis if they're going to do it just deal with it and be done with it Uh-huh Oh I Oh I think it's a safety factor too because you know when people are inebriated whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever they are very unsafe for the their co-workers you know it's like you know my father was a fireman and I can just imagine if you know you know some guy being on drugs they go there and and you know you've got somebody that's supposed to take care of you and they fall they fall out because of the drug issue you know you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden they maybe get hurt or whatever that that you can understand Seems that there should be a slash after 'you know'  but the use of drugs or anything like that will uh be a problem
