Up here in Rochester uh we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution I think Grand Rapids was number one Uh we really don't have too much of a problem as far as uh industry since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here But we do have the same problem a lot of ar- other areas up here in the northeast have and that is the effects of acid rain Com- coming basically from coal plants in Ohio and Illinois and Indiana Yeah I've I've uh was in Los Angeles once and that was quite a difference as far as pollution goes I mean you couldn't really see that much Every once in a while we have these air inversions the weather inversions and then it gets hazy around here but they're really we don't have a big problem with it I think that uh what most of the people here in New York state are going after right now is it's it's the uh ongoing acid rain problem Especially out in the uh uh Adirondack areas where you know the lakes are becoming uh changing the acidity of the lakes and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants uh or alkaline liking plants are j- not lasting anymore because the soil levels the p H is changing as this acid rain continues to fall And I know that there's been battles over the states up here Uh you know Governor Mario going after you know governors of Ohio and Il- and Indiana to fix what's going on down there I remember when I was in Florida the only problem was that it seemed like it may it wasn't really pollution just the steamy weather Yeah it Oh yeah I you know I was in Boston once and I remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour even with the Tee Uh just this it looked like billions of cars massing and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go I mean yeah that's what's in you know Los Angeles is I think that's biggest problem because when I was in Los Angeles for a time it's all you know from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city And there's really there's nowhere for this to be absorbed really Uh tree planting sometimes can handle you know stopping some of the air pollution and that and help but if you have nowhere to do anything  Yeah I you know Florida doesn't seem to be at least maybe Miami but I I uh you know Fort Lauderdale I I don't know what the big industries are down there uh but you know up here we have Kodak and that's the worst polluter They put uh uh you can smell ether in the air sometimes It keeps the neighborhoods happy I guess Uh cause they clean the uh the lenses for cameras and they they make film here and they're the worst offender but it's you know it's under so much control You know sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them but that's really getting under control now Be interesting to see when as Mexico develops industrially whether you know without
