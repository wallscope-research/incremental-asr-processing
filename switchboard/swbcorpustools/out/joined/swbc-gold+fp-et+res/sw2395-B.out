I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends I'm in Dallas Are you in Dallas also Oh really okay Uh-huh Oh really Uh-huh I normally find that uh I- I'm probably the most um news hungry of my friends so I don't we don't normally talk about the news at lunch I I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because I used to get it during the week but um I would always end up arriving at work late because I would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning So I have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work Um the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television and I enjoy that quite a bit Uh-huh I will admit I work with uh someone who's Iranian and he definitely has a very different slant on the news He's very very skeptical of the news media and I will admit I'm reasonably skeptical also But he's I don't know uh he's mu- much much more so It's sort of interesting though because he does bring a a much um different perspective with all the Gulf goings on um He was always speaking in terms of you know American imperialism reasserting itself Um I suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country Uh-huh True um the They um tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story They will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time Sort of like the uh what is that A B C's NIGHTLINE Well I guess they only normally stick with just the one um story But they they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories No no It's very much national interest news A lot of times they end up um with these panels of experts and they go back and forth where everyone's giving some opinions and sometimes that I don't know the value of that because I saw plenty of jokes and and um oh editorial cartoons about all the retired generals making a living during the the Gulf War Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I will admit it's interesting I- I- I'm twenty-six So I don't have any more experience in that than you Um it it it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind you know there were some that were screaming for air power there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it And they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world which I suppose just about everyone does but these guys had a a uh national soap box to stand on and and express this view Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I didn't see anything like that although I did uh I guess one thing that I found sort of interesting this is getting a little off the topic but there was a a a big push with the local T V stations to have little hot lines with counselors to to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children I thought that was a really unusual thing Uh-huh <> Ju- It- with the children's aspect Uh-huh I suppose that is a valuable service Again not having uh lived through another war I don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of or if that was a new concern with people Uh-huh That's true That's true And <> probably more importantly one that lasted short enough that that people's interest didn't flag too badly I will admit the same thing And I would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer and they would run these extended two three hour versions of the program and I I was just I was horrified and fascinated by what I was seeing Uh-huh Uh-huh I I didn't have that experience I I don't have cable so I I'm pretty much limited to P B S which I thought I thought they did a very good job Um I've got one question for you I <> you say you take the newspaper Um I I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting We've got the one fairly well relatively weaker paper the TIMES HERALD and then the MORNING NEWS which has a very strong subscription Does San Antonio ha- you said San Antonio right Do you have just one paper or do you have several Uh-huh Uh-huh I I actually take both newspapers on the weekends I figure I'm only taking on the weekend and I can afford that I I find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better but I sort of have a liberal political slant and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly conservative editorial um outlook I get the TIMES HERALD just to balance that out a little bit Uh-huh
