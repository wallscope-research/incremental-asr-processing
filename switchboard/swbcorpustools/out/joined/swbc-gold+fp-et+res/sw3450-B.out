Well unfortunately very little Uh much less than what I need to Well I uh am an assistant teacher and uh in business technology and I've I think the most exercise I've gotten in the last three to four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids' questions It keeps me pretty busy but it's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going And uh you know it really exercise is so important And I realize that When you uh exercise what do you do Do you do it at home or a club or I got a hold of uh Richard Simmons' tape uh what is it uh I can't even think of the name of it right offhand with the oldies Sweating with the to the oldies title yeah and that's not bad That's pretty upbeat so you know I every once in a while I'll put the cassette in and go with it Not often enough to have a routine My little Schnauzer wishes I would get out and walk with her But uh I don't know by the time I get home all I want to do is just collapse or sit down at my computer and my fingers exercise more than anything now Yes Uh do you ever ride a bike or anything like that Here about the the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk uh Because they're enclosed and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter And it's safe That's uh you know inside the mall may be not safe going to the parking garage I know a doctor once told me it it a friend of mine uh suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is The uh swimming they say uses more muscles than any other exercise with and the water takes the resistance Right and you don't get the soreness I've I've done some water exercises but our pool is not is not heated so it's Summertime only You don't go out when it's twenty some odd degrees go out to the swimming pool Hot tubs are not uh not too bad but So what part of Mississippi are you from Whereabouts is that Oh and you do have cold weather down there Ours started Thanksgiving And uh from there just well today was pretty but uh oh Sunday the snow and ice came in And uh there was no exercise
