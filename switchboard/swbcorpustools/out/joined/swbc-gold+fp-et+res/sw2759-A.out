All right Um that's a good question Um I had a job I had to go get a blood test for Um and and they did a full blood screen on me but they didn't call that a drug test So tha- I think they checked for drugs They just don't tell you they did Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah <> Well I guess it depends on if you got something to worry about Well I I I come from kind of a biased opinion because I'm a a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor And I've done employee assistant work and I I know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents on the job that are specifically drug and alcohol related and it's like in the billions of dollars every year Um and th- the only way that they can prevent that is is you know making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free And you know the the problem in the work place is that that people are like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever you can come to come to work drunk and get in an accident and he'll cover up for you and nobody knows about it but c- you know ends up costing the company lots and lots of money So you know Uh-huh Yeah Yeah True Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Well there it's I I think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired Because generally you know it Uh you find out one way or another if somebody's got a problem on the job And if e- even if like you say even if it's just the secretary if her work or abilities start affecting her co-workers then it it's still a problem So Well yeah I guess it comes with the turf Yeah Man And in terms of drugs they're illegal So you're you're breaking the law anyway Probably the the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of of assessing for alcohol And that's probably the biggest problem there is Yeah Uh-huh Well I guess that's one of the positive things that ha- have come out of it some of the employee assistance program If you do test positive for something they will give you an op- o- opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose you're job you're> your And I th- Yeah I think the benef- the company benefits in the long run What what kind of testing do they do when you went Urine screen Yeah Uh-huh Well that happens It happens a lot There there are people that n- pay other people to to help them out Yeah Yeah Yeah It depends r- r- really on how how strong a test it is They've got different degrees as far as as how far back they can check They got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests They've some companies that are doing uh hair tests Yeah Well that they'll pull out one of your hairs and they can apparently test um back a certain period of time Because some of the the residue ends up in your hair follicles you know it's kind of Hair follicles I guess are just dead protein and they And it it's apparently al- almost like a a calendar They they've got it pretty precise now They can go back and look at in terms of growth in a in a hair when you used and and that type of thing So <> Yeah So I guess if they perfect that is not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that Uh-huh Yeah Well I did too Uh-huh Bye-bye
