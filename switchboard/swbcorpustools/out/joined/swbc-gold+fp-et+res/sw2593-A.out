So the the topic is hobbies Yeah Who has spare time Um I don't really don't really do any handicraft things like that I used to I used to do like salt ornaments and things But that was oh good many many years ago and I have I really my spare time I usually go do aerobics and read and that's about it Yeah Yeah family Well well that's what I meant by salt that we we did that like as a family little ornaments and things like that and just kind of really got into it Like during the Christmas season making them up for other people and things like that But as far as I've just never been very skilled at far you know needle work cloths And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good and Yeah Uh-huh It's not like you sit and knit every night Yeah I don't even know how to knit and my mother used to knit you know all the time and and I don't even know how to knit I'm like that's a lost art from this family So um but it's not a very good topic it feels like if you know not when you're n- neither one of us are really I I have seen things I really like you know that were done especially like needlepoint Needlepoint cushions and things But it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it you know and and that the petty point and things like that It's like God it it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made Yeah Yeah And see they do that as their job Whereas you know for us it and they make it cheaper for us to buy So but and I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that because I can remember when I used to do you know those little salt those figurines and things It was it was relaxing you know creative you felt very creative But it just was so time time involved you know so much time involved and the different steps and things So and Yeah So Okay I hope you have a good rest of your weekend Okay Bye-bye
