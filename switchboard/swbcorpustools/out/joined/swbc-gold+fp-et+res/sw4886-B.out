No I'm not in the middle of anything I've just about the last thing I did about maybe oh close to a year ago now I guess I I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house So I guess that Yeah That that was fairly large undertaking A a it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house Oh we did it all except for the sheetrocking That was the only thing we didn't you know putting the ceiling up and things like that we don't we we weren't sure how to do that and Yeah that's the exact opposite We did all put the roof up and did all the roofing and the put all the interior walls up We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work and that's it because you have you know get those joints to go together and whatever you have to put in there to get the s- to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that I di- we didn't know a thing about any of that and so It's it looked very hard to do so we figured well just I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional So we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living But Probably so and I we'd never done it so we just left it alone But that's I guess I'm only twenty-one so I my my vast experience of home home owner's knowledge is not very much So it's just what I have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents so It was brand new We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house so it was Uh well my dad knew how to do most of it you know He he'd we'd gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it I don't know He well he did all the flooring himself He put the whole the whole floor in and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there And then we were put a like a not not necessarily a garage but just like a off the side of that after we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less It's not you know it's not enclosed It's just somewhere to drive another car to to park and it's Uh it's off the ground Uh-huh It's on about uh twenty-two inch piers something like that So Uh no those those are we did those ourselves so Yeah Exactly so It's Yeah those ar- those are we'd I've done one I helped somebody do one of those before Those are those are you know you can buy them in kits but we didn't do that way But it's Yeah Yeah yeah That's not near like building a house or anything but Yeah those are nice Especially when you get done you've got something you know I don't know I like them You just sit down on on the deck and do whatever Have a barbecue or Yeah that sounds nice All done by yourself huh Designed Yeah Yeah That's pretty that's a good size deck So yeah That's Yeah That's not Yeah that's good That's not bad at all Didn't have to th- the wood may it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is you know To get to get good lumber it costs I don't know about Dallas but arou- even in this little town it's it's not cheap at all I was surprised It's probably more there Yeah yeah that it probably does I I'm not sure but Yeah It's nothing but woods up here down here Yeah I don't I haven't I haven't I used to live in Dallas In Arlington actually And but that was just when I was a kid so I don't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore But it's I don't know we're a college town so that doesn't help us out any We have gas is a dollar t- dollar twelve a gallon so that's probably about what you're paying so Yeah You've got something going all the time
