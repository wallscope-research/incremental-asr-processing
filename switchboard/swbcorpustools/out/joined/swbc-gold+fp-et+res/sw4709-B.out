Well as far as tangible benefits go I would say that uh health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern I feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care dental and vision as well as good long-term and short-term disability plans uh goes a long way toward satisfying my needs Right You you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical and uh you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your your compensation package Yeah they look at you say well you're still breathing so uh Yeah Right I suspect that it just disappeared Right Uh I work for a little start-up company here in Pittsburgh called Trans Ark Uh Have you heard of them They we do uh distributive system software for Unix based workstations So Ah yes yes In fact my mom drives trucks so Yes So yeah I see uh after the merger uh you see a lot of Ryder PIE stuff on the road So did did Ryder get out of the business Is that what happened or Right Huh So that the merger pretty much ended the whole thing Yeah and the the problem with that is you know when you leave a job you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time But when when the company goes bankrupt the they're just cut off completely and you're responsible for your own And and that's exceedingly expensive Right It's definitely excessive True Yeah they're starting to to cut back Especially start-ups I know here at Trans Ark we get uh we get health care and that's it there's no dental or vision And the the short-term disability policy is is a ninety day policy and there is no long-term disability policy So you know at least in the case of this particular company they tend to scrimp a little bit there And you know of course they can use the excuse well we're start-up Right Well that certainly doesn't help matters any you you get people who are willing to put their neck on the line to get you you know these additional benefits
