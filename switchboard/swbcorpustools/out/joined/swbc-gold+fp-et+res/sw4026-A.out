So How's your products been I hear that one Have you had any lately go out Oh wow So you didn't get anything even all the all the warranties were out You're kidding Yeah we just moved into a new house too so we had to buy all those too Yeah the only thing I've had problems with is um I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail and I bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings So I didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than I just ended up using it But that's about the only thing I've had gone wrong But That's incredible And they all went out at the same time Or two days Wow Wow it's frustrating Uh-huh Uh-huh they go out a lot Yeah See I'm in the manufacturing home from work and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags Yeah At Morton International and I thin- well it's it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment We test everything after each assembly process and so our testing is pretty thorough but Um Um the tests that well we test every one electrically We don't I think they test four or five a day actually exploding the air bags and but we do test after during the assembly project product um after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there after we install it so each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done and then we do electrical tests on them during the process so Yeah Well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government it's incredible how much testing they have to do Uh-huh
