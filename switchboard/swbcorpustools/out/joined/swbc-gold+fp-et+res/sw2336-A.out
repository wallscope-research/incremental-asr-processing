Okay so what kind of car are you thinking about getting Well when you decide to Uh-huh So you like the Ford Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah it's the this the car I had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact and uh I loved it I really did But uh um I finally decided to go check out what the uh what the uh foreign cars were So I bought myself a a a Nissan a two forty S X But even though I love the car I've got now I think my next car will probably be American again because if I can at all do it I'd like to stay American I always have up until now I just for one time decided to go outside So Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Well Ford's done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to te- six years so of really turning around their um quality I think um Uh-huh Um Oh yeah those were not good cars Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh You know the only thing I'm looking at right now um I just I just bought you know the Nissan that I've got about uh say nine months ago I guess it was So the only thing that that would get me to change cars right now would be if see at the moment I'm single and if I were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it But uh I don't have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking you know Uh cars are too expensive right now to uh to even think about buying new cars every couple of years you know it's Uh-huh Um Uh-huh Yeah that's uh I went to a a car show down here about uh about two weeks ago and um you know of course they had the normal the Ford the the Chevrolet that stuff But then you started looking at the uh uh they had Ferrari there they had uh B M W and all these other kinds of cars And Ferrari didn't even let you near the car they were that's how expensive they were And then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars you saw eighty thousand dollar cars and even even though I I I do enjoy cars I enjoy um driving them I enjoy uh riding in them and everything but I can't see buying paying more for a car than I would for a house you know That doesn't seem likely Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I think so That's happened to me once So uh Yeah like uh I think the one time I did it was on Sau- the Mid the Mid East the crisis out there That was had a great conversation but uh then they came off and told us we couldn't do it any more So Yeah You too Bye-bye
