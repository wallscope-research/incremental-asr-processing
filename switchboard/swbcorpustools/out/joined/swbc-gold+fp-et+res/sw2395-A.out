Where do you get most of your news Where where are you Oh yeah No I'm in San Antonio I get my news from a combination of sources I take the paper every day and I read it on the way in to work on the in a carpool Uh-huh And uh and I watch the uh actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work And then you know usually over lunch there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Um one of the women that I work with her husband is Iranian So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch Uh-huh Uh-huh <> Well I I uh I like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize I understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably doesn't Uh-huh Uh-huh They don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in in every little town Yeah I've been getting a kick out of those lately Although um <> I- I'm only twenty-five so I've never actually been through a period of war and I don't know anyone in the military and I don't have a lot of background knowledge in uh military strategy and and weaponry and and all that kind of stuff And I thought the generals were very interesting Now when they started to speculate I I saw that for what is was and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on But I thought the- the- they were interesting and and they shed some light on what was going on for me Uh-huh You know one of the best television news shows that I saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on A B C and it was for children and it was hosted by Peter Jennings and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions And they they had all their correspondents in the different areas in Saudi Arabia and Israel and and all They had them all uh on I don't know what you'd call it other than on line They had them all on hold and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person and that person would answer the question It was just very informative and interesting and uh I was real impressed at how A B C handled uh translating the war for children Uh-huh And our local H E B stores here I don't know if it's H E B statewide or whatever but they have videos that uh I don't know if they still have them but they were free rental videos that had something to do with the war Uh it was Right It was something for children that they they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and uh getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing Well back during the Viet Nam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war uh the that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal So I don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news Yeah I tell you what the first three days I was glued to the television And I Yeah I tell you what The uh the war start- <> let's see was it a Wednesday or Thursday Must have been Thursday uh and Friday night I was I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open Because I was watching C N N and they would they would switch back to one of their Israel bureaus and the people would be standing there in gas masks and you'd be hearing the sirens and it was just I was amazed Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh No There are two and they're pretty close Uh the one that I picked is more similar in format to the newspaper I grew up near Houston and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck and the one I picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as I was growing up the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff It's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over and I enjoy the comics are better in this newspaper This newspaper has the far side and the comics that I enjoy and the other one has some weird ones that I've never heard of So Do you Yeah And my My fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers He takes both San Antonio papers an Austin paper both Houston papers I guess he takes seven the San Marcos paper and the New Braunsfel paper but he's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University so he's getting all the sports sections And so you know he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that go unread
