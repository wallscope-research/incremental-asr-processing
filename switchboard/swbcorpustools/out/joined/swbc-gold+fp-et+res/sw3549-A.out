What are you guys having for Christmas Oh you're not Yeah Well funny you should mention that I'm a pig farmer Yeah Well now it's kind of a hobby more than anything else but we're going to have uh wild boar we uh we killed a boar the other day it was you know mating with the sows and you can't use the piglets you know so It's about six months of no use so we uh we shot him and cleaned him out and had him you know processed into ham and uh we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig because I I've got one that's got a a hernia and rather than you know pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery we'll just cook him and eat him Well no hey I tell you what preparing a little pig is is a snap I'm telling you real easy easier than chicken Yeah you just uh you kill him you know you probably most guys just shoot them in the head they go you know in a second they're gone and then you just dip the carcass in uh boiling water pull it out {A and there's a we use a little raspy brush pulls the hair off } and uh gut it and uh just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and uh some pineapple about three pineapples you know sliced them up and uh cover him up with uh wet uh sacks feed sacks is what I usually use more than one utt and then start a charcoal fire on top of him And after about six hours you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there and it's the best eating you ever had Yep just like a pig you know uh it has a lot less fat This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds Well you know we took the skin and the head and the le- and the feet off and that was about you know a hundred hundred pounds of just ham Oh well we're you know we're not going to eat the whole thing It would take a year But uh you know we're going to drive up to Kansas City see my wife's folks and uh she she what's what's what's your mother cooking for Christmas yeah well her mom's doing brisket Brisket It's a part of the cow that they used to throw away It's just tough as a boot and uh you know they used to use it for leather I think no I was kidding But uh it's it's a part of the loin you know the rib cage and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of gristle where it attaches to the ribs so it's really really a tough piece of meat but it's so tasty you can't stand it So you just take it and you marinate it for a couple of days And then uh you just put it in the oven takes about four hours to cook one They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds And uh we're going to have that Oh well we'll have cranberries and hominy and uh we we are we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here We have oliv- olives black olives and cucumbers and uh tomatoes we still have tomatoes yeah fresh tomatoes Well it started to freeze up around here you know there's nothing between you and us but our barb wire and half of that's down it's thirty degrees this morning Yeah But uh it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost Oh yeah Well it's desert you know where where we are it's it's it's uh the edge of the desert it's part of the Great Plains So in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred hundred and ten and at night it goes down to about sixty Yeah we get a fifty de- degree temperature swing in about four hours So everything that lives around here is real tough That's trees you know we got hundred year old trees that are you know twenty feet tall That's all the bigger they get they you know they're just hard as a rock
