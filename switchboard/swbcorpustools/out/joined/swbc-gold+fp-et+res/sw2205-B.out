Well do you have time to read the paper in the morning You know a lot a lot of people don't take newspapers at all We we took the MORNING NEWS for a while and then uh well we've been taking the TIMES HERALD for ages and then uh dog just ran off with my shoe that's off the subject went outside picked it up and ran off Anyway uh and then we switched the MORNING NEWS but we found we couldn't read enough of it and by the time I got home and had time to to read some but but I guess the the issue is uh beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines Did did you did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about uh Pete Arnett and uh the the news coverage Well any you know TIME magazine and even the news that sometimes that that's why I like some diversity the idea that I we have TIME which which we take from time to time and we the problem is they call up and make this deal you know and well we're taking that and and we also hit the Garland GARLAND DAILY NEWS I guess it's it comes out sporadically like twice a week or some- but I think what's interesting is that if you're that there uh that as difficult as it is or as as much as they try they put some bias I had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial And that but and and you know people accuse them of controlling the news he says you know we don't control the news we just report it the way we the way it is And Yes Yeah and I I thought that was particularly interesting in the the Gulf War that there were pieces of information that that were apparently uh leaked just as a as as uh a ploy Which was uh I I find that fascinating that uh I listen to K R L D and uh uh K L I F the news talk radio And I actually listen to C N N radio Do you know it was on radio now It's on eleven ninety Well when I go to work I listen Yeah Well with with your you know if you're around the home though and and and can watch T V and read the paper the problem is is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is and then they start repeating everything And and so it's kind of a oh that's what's interesting is the C N N uh I don't think I'm trying to think if it's much local I listen to a little of that and I listen to a little of ninety point one I I'm I'm inveterate switcher That and ninety-eight point seven I'm eclectic approach Well I watch channel five but that has to be that's another bias That has to do with the weather reporting I'm not sure that actually I think channel eight is probably but I know Dave Fox he goes to our church so Well the Channel eight when they came here thirteen fourteen years ago Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together uh from Oklahoma City and apparently channel eight was way down and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job and then they've been some people move around and uh John Chriswell is anyway the I I don't know do you do you do you seem to can you tell much difference between the local radio T V stations I think that adds to the diversity I think that uh I like that Uh there I know you know John Wylie Price I don't know if you kept up but he's been protesting Yeah and I think he has legitimate argument you can uh I I I grew up in Alabama and so I I have some prejudices But I think that I think that that from a a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station Uh I'm not sure I I'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs but I think that uh in some cases this should be some real opportunity and and some diversity and and this kind of thing and I think that Dallas it turns out though from what I understand has quite good I occasionally go to Saint Louis And uh there for a few days and watch the news and and think Dallas really does have have quite good news I think channel eight is the number one uh A B C affiliate in the U S I think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he Course he pumping his own <> Where'd you move from Yeah It is interesting though it becomes a little of personality In fact the the guy that was on the weatherman on channel eight worked for me oh long time ago twenty years or so even longer than that Twenty-one twenty-three years ago or so twenty-four anyway long time ago and and shortly after I got we got here fourteen years ago and uh they had they had fired him uh because he was too t- anyway didn't he didn't have the personality and wasn't drawing the crowds and that's interesting That's that's what the T V stations do they're trying to get ratings And I think if we remember that that they're out after the ratings Well it's like the the Dale Hansen on channel eight is a sometimes a little too cutesy but I wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes Have you talked have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes Okay well good talking to you Goodnight
