Well we uh we really like the Mexican food you know here in Texas and uh so we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying them out and so uh Tia's is probably our favorite uh restaurant there and I think they have one of the best services that uh that we really like it No Where's that at Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Really Oh that uh no we haven't explored uh you know too many places Um you know lot of the big name brand I guess uh chains yeah but um oh we've tried places you know down uh by the Collin Creek Mall the uh you know Alvarez and um gosh we tried what was across the street El Paso's El Chico's or something yeah something something like that uh-huh uh-huh Yeah yeah Oh yes Yes Oh Uh-huh uh-huh Oh I know I tell I tell you what They are they just um they're excellent uh excellent food I wish I could make them here at home Just can't make those flour tortillas But Well I love uh I love seafood and I notice they have like the you know The Louisiana Purchase um Razzoo's has opened up down you know off of um um oh close to six thirty-five Yes I have eaten there Now the only problem note the setup for a negative comment I love the food It's a lot of cajun food and good seafood but uh the service has always been so strange every time I've been in there Mostly it's been at lunch time and uh but I hear at night though they have uh you know the outdoor um bar and um uh that's it's really uh you know kind of lively So it's it's really good All their blackened grill stuff Uh-huh Oh well that sounds great Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh slash error Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh well I uh I have children and and work and so we uh we can eat a lot of fast food Uh-huh Yeah I know I I know I I'm so sick of McDonalds and we used to eat there we used to eat there all the time And so now we we we branch out at this Wendy's or some other fast food joint Oh and and cheap too Yeah but but the kids they've got those expensive tastes so uh they like Tia's so they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff Yeah I know They they they're just spoiled rotten but uh but no I uh uh we love to eat out of course it's just so much easier and simpler yeah So we uh we usually eat out generally two or three times a week Yeah yeah Oh me too me too So I know uh I I know that I uh you know I just work and I'm just tired when I get home and I I just don't feel like cooking And uh you know on the weekends there's always things to do and uh so we like to go out to lunch on Saturdays especially Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah now I we've been there twice and and both times I just oh the food just didn't quite settle with me and I don't know what it was Uh-huh uh-huh Yes and I love Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah Oh family restaurant Uh-huh Now I haven't been there befo- I went to one I think in Ohio or or or somewhere up there but I've never been to that one here I know it's just down the street So Now have you been to Applebee's Yes Yes I I really like that too so that was uh Oh I've been I've been there twice uh-huh yeah so Salad bar yes
