They're not quite elderly huh Uh-huh Uh not for my parents But I I was around uh two sets of grandparents uh quite a bit we we put one I put one grandfather in a rest home and that killed him Well yeah kind of Well there was some other things involved but it before he was really active and the there was some you know he lost his drivers license and I couldn't get around and wasn't able to do some things and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home And he just kind of became a vegetable and died So but that was a long time ago That was uh back in like seventy-three So uh I think the way they did things were a lot different back then And uh my grandmother his his wife uh we also put her in a rest home She was in a rest home and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there and uh had a physical had a good physical therapist at that place and they worked with her and got her walking and got her ta- kind of taking care of herself and so she was able to come back home and then she had to go back in a couple of times but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up And they got her going again So I guess as far as looking I said as what you're looking for I think you need to look for an active uh an interactive staff Somebody who is willing to work with uh you know work with a patients and do do things with them and treat them treat like they're It it is It is expensive Uh-huh Oh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh When she can't take care of herself Uh-huh Now Uh-huh Does she have a is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to or she can go down to the cafeteria Uh-huh In fact I Uh-huh Yeah I I really like that concept They've they have a few of those well quite a few of those places like that here in Utah and you know couples can you know husband and wife can can live there too or or whatever I and and then and yet they have their their friendships and relationships and the <> you know of getting together and eating together and all of that I I think it really takes uh you know looking more at the people than even really the facilities Uh-huh Yeah Yes Well I I think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary you know a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's it's almost like that you know they say putting them out to pasture and some some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active They they wanted to do things They didn't you know they didn't want to go down and play bingo or uh you know play with the oranges /
