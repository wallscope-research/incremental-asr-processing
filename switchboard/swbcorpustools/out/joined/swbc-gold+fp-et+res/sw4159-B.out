Well I work for an insurance company so I see a lot of uh verdicts that are pretty crazily decided Um by juries particularly and I know in England the judges set all of the awards You know juries will decide the guilt or innocence but then they leave the awards up to more learned people And I think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous you know like millions and millions of dollars Oh exactly Each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what um the going you know if you will the going uh award should be for a certain type of case you know within some kind of range When you get one way out like that but then really doesn't pen- wind up penalizing the person that they went after Who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us If they get some of those mega awards against them You know they're not going to sit there and lose money If they are losing money then they're going to raise rates So it all comes filtering down to us all in- individually And uh granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged you know I don't know You know some of the health insurance is written that way You know that uh if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy you know it s- + pre specified in the policy so much but I don't know that you can necessarily put a a value on somebody's limb uh arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases I think maybe you look at uh the age of the person and their station in life and and uh how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up you know with with that maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old I I think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there And there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing and that can be part of continuing education maybe for judges I don't know You know to get into the economics of things uh because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards it really you know ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away If it's a company you know that they're insured Unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages I think those should be uninsurable I think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that that did the damage Yeah Yeah For for honest mistakes where they've done something and and something happens One of their employees causes damage or something Sure That's what they buy insurance for Well I was just talking about any company Uh let's just say a lumber manufacturing company and uh somebody is on the premises and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift and he pushes the wrong button and he drops a load of lumber on somebody and it injures them Sure Insurance should pay for that Well I'm not talking about any loss I was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due And then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a l- usually a lot less But it's an an amount their designed to sting them a little for their negligence For gross wanton negligence in a claim And unfortunately the ch- the lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too So again it never really penalizes the company doing the wrong They can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to And if if they know some practice is wrong you know I'm not talking about your isolated occurrences I'm talking more about the you know the thing that they know maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that Then I think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket
