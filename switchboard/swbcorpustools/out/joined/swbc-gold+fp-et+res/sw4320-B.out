So how serious is the subject of crime in your area Jeez Well luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here Uh San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime Uh but it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the uh outlying agricultural towns Uh because you end up having a lot of gangs forming uh largely around the Hispanic core Uh it seems to be that uh gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well that's efficient They're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort Wow Yeah yeah I'd heard that phrase Uh-huh Yeah there aren't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays Uh-huh Well uh there's a couple of things that I've heard uh most of them are fairly uh radical in terms of what you'd have to do Uh course the the reason that that these kids tend to to turn toward the drugs and everything else s- seems to be just you know the the the end results of of poverty and and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else because you know the parents aren't making a living at anything Uh And they're accidental parents half the time anyway It's illegal but it's not wrong because all their friends do it Yeah Well I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of of an actual solution to the problem Uh the the social the other social problems wouldn't wouldn't go away Uh there's there's been a lot of uh and I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus but then the more I thought about it the more sense it made is that uh alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else Uh and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow
