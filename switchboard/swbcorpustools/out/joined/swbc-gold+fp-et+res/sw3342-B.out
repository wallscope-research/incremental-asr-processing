Well I do love to fish Well I don't know how much you can learn I'm not so sure I'm good at it but I do enjoy doing it Yeah Well I hope it is there's not a whole lot of different kinds I don't do a lot of deep sea fishing I because I get seasick but we have a lot of lakes here in this area and I do a lot of fishing for uh bass We have a lot of uh uh couple of lakes in our area that are fil- just filled with good sized bass And then when I get tired of them outwitting me I fish for catfish and we use worms and shiners which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows and then I also use spinner baits and plastic worms It all depends on what I'm fishing for and the time of day I do Uh there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here and it's very convenient on afternoons when I want to just get away and sit and think Fishing's a good way to do that and I have a lot of friends who like to go fishing No I don't I have a friend who has a little infla- inflatable raft and we use that sometimes I wish I had a boat but I don't Uh-huh Right That's the same way here isn't it You have to get back in the sticks in the Right Oh We don't have We don't have a big problem with turtles but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes And I Well I can't think of a time that I've been fishing that I haven't run into one or two of them No we uh occasionally I'll catch an eel on a on a hook but never the snakes They just kind of Uh we have a lot of cotton mouth so yes they are definitely and they live in little shallow little coves that I like to fish in so I seem them swimming by every once in a while Yeah they can they're they're certainly ugly Yeah Definitely Do you have bass Right Well that's pretty much the same way here I Well we have those I don't I inevitably if I enter one of those I never catch a thing I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it Oh yes Yeah oh definitely Certainly here they are Yeah it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish That's what I do a lot
