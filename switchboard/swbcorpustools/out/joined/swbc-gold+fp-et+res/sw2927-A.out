Well I'm talking to you from Dallas What part of the country are you in Well we can uh complain together or swear we can complain together about the humidity No I don't think so I wouldn't think yeah I Far north Dallas Yeah about a half a mile from Plano So we're in the Yeah it's been very very rainy I know Oh um I don't know I haven't lived here let's see we m- lived out of state in Wisconsin and we just c- we lived here ten years ago and when we first lived here we l- we were in Garland East Richardson and um doesn't seem like it was quite as humid And I don't know then we went we lived in uh Madison Wisconsin for five years um for my husband's schooling a- graduate schooling and it just it's a lot cleaner up there but um it's a lot colder too Uh his job he came back to start work again for a different company so said Here here's a g- here we are again It just seems a little more humid than it I don't ever remember of course you know you only remember the good stuff but um I just don't remember the humidity This much rain and this much humidity Uh yeah they are Actually though it was a lot rainier here in the winter uh we came back last August It's just a lot rainier than I remember it all th- through the seasons you know Um Yeah and I think it's because it's just getting more crowded and more polluted I really do think that's part of it Um uh in in Wisconsin and Minnesota when they get winters it's um th- the winters are bad but not what you hear about It's just like down here when you hear when people here think it's a hundred and six people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here Hundre- I'm making that up You know when it's only like ninety-five Um it's just like up there when you hear it's forty below it's probably really only five below Um and it's so dry that it's it's like going to Ar- well probably what y- Arizona used to be like you know it's just dry and cool so it's not it's not what you think it is Um no there have been times though when it gets so frigid that you you can't stand it Where did you move here from Well there you could talk about that that's that's a strange state for Oh there you go okay This is very true Yeah right well actually the summers up there we thought were the most beautiful time of the year Um in terms of Colorado I know my husband likes to camp and backpack and all the stuff I don't like um but I'd used to go on I worked for a mortgage company in Wisconsin and I did a lot of business in uh um Colo- well Denver and that's that's probably one of the stranger things when you see the air inversions and then you go into the mountains and it's snowy and col- uh it just was a very mixed bag in terms of Colorado Isn't that strange Yeah and then things like torn- are there tornadoes in Colorado yes or n- I don't Yeah The mountains yeah Even I'm originally from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and I can tell you that um they've even had in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania they've even had I'm going to say mini tornadoes for lack of a better word And and that's just a part of the country that it's rolling hillside That was unheard of you know twenty years ago Um so I don't know what's happening if it's you know we are the greenhouse I don't really know It's just you know It's definitely not as um I know I associate the pollution with weather in general so I guess one thing we do miss is that's a smaller town and it w- it was it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere you know You too Okay Bye-bye
