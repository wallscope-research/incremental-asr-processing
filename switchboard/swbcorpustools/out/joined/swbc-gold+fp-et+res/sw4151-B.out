That's a good question Uh there would be a point there was a point where I would have said no that no one would deserve to die for for a crime that he committed But uh since I've become a parent and since I've seen uh things like Jeffrey Dahlmer I really have to question that I really uh I I can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people And uh try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment Uh Oh it's a uh it's a question of your your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response Uh a- and that was the thing that uh killed Dukakis back uh four years ago when someone asked him a similar question and he he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when uh people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion uh a gut level reaction And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level Uh you know whether it be a biblical force uh you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic or just uh uh some sort of anger at putting peop- putting uh murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life uh while we foot the bill I think people are are working at that from more of a uh a gut reaction than a a reason humane one That's true Uh th- the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't uh agree with that I don't think anyone who would commit a uh a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say well I was about to kill and dismember this person but oh if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it I I just don't think that uh that it works that way Uh-huh Well I I don't know if that would really work that way or not Uh there's a lot of violence
