Carolyn I have a little Schnauzer little miniature Schnauzer What do you have You know those make the best animals uh pe- best pets My uh son has a uh oh it's a real mixture it's part uh Doberman and part Husky Yes and they gentlest dog you ever met and they got him from the uh Humane Society here in Oklahoma City and she's just turned out to be a jewel My my little Schnauzer is is my friend She is so spoiled She's a year and a half old now and being single she's become very important in my life it's so nice to have come home and find something or someone who's really so happy to see you Sometimes I wish I had not gotten this one it's a puppy because I work and I'm not home and unfortunately she's not as well trained as as I would like her to be and I realize it's my fault I'm not doing a really great job as a disciplinarian but uh It is it is She's you know she's real good I can leave her all day in the bathroom with her toys and her food and everything and and not one mess does she make and then we go outside and she'll stay outside for oh thirty minutes to an hour come inside and use the restroom I just want to kill her at those times But she's a doll she's a love she really is You know I I we always had a pet when I was growing up oh always had a dog My mother did not like cats So we always had a dog and and then course when my children were growing up we always had a dog and always said it was because the children wanted the pet and I find that I'm enjoying this one far more than I ever did when it was the children's dog I uh in fact my children gave me this this little puppy for Christmas Yeah I think so Oh my goodness Two babies huh Oh That that is really probably bad timing Oh yes Do you and patience and you have to you really have to be just like your children when you set a rule you have to stand by it and be consistent and
