Uh taxes Do you want to go ahead Uh-huh I agree Uh-huh Well I think uh you know when I look at uh all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money that's not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at a at a better discount uh when you when Exactly exactly That's exactly uh the whole thing When you take a look at all those issues of where our money is going and it's just as long as the person that's spending the money uh doesn't think about oh I can go out and spend anything that I want to it's just unlimited Right An unlimited source so they they think well I'll go out and buy a four hundred toilet seat and I could have went to K-Mart and bought it for you know ten or fifteen that kind of thing and uh Exactly Exactly And I know a lot of uh corporations now are looking at their amount of money that's being spent and they're looking at what's the best buy It used to be you could go if you had a company you had to go through certain people and you didn't care what you paid I mean you just got it done Now people are putting in bids for things and are looking at things Going to actually shop at Best Buy for Best Buy is one of our electronic stores for fax machines things like that instead of going through these office supply companies that mark up their amounts and say you know I'll give you a legal pad for five bucks and you can go to another shop and get it for maybe sixty cents or nin- or ninety cents that kind of thing so Except for everything keeps going up you know And I know as a middle class uh you know and also I have one dependent has my daughter and I keep looking at well where's the tax so-called tax uh relief for having children there is none I think I paid just as much as when I didn't have her so Uh-huh Sure Exactly Uh-huh Exactly Yeah that's the whole thing Now they have gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes but you're still going to owe the government as much money so by the end of this coming year what's going to happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings uh account They won't be able to pay it and there'll be a lot of problems because of that you know Put people into you know January or February which is always suppose to be the month after Christmas is supposed to be high spending because everything is on sale Nobody's going to have the money to spend They're going to be paying on their taxes so they're going to have to just cut back so I don't know where the answer is and Yeah Yeah No no Well that's the whole thing I think people are getting so fed up with it Now we go through another election and listen to all these lies about the No No Well I don't think people think they can make a difference And when you've got candidates as you do It's candidates that have money and it's backed by big business And big business says well we don't care about the little person and uh you know you're not going to get anymore Abe Lincolns around Uh-huh Well who knows uh yeah Generations from now we might uh set back in our little uh rocking chairs and watch our grandchildren go through an entirely different system of things and say you know this government itself isn't working Just like the communist government of uh the old U S S R And maybe that's going to happen to America where they'll say hey we're fed up Maybe it'll have to be just individual state tax And each state take care of itself and no government type of uh you know where you have to pay out to federal or whatever I don't know Who knows but Uh-huh yeah Yeah Everybody is in fact I'm not sending in my check
