Well I guess it depends on what age I am in the thirty something so I know I lived through it Uh are you old enough to know about the war Uh-huh Okay Well yeah you are old enough But it was on the fringe It ended uh when I was in uh college In uh when I turned nineteen in nineteen seventy I cannot even remember at this point Uh when I turned nineteen it was the year that uh the draft was still going on If I had been a male or in Israel I would have been number two Yeah So I learned a lesson in gender Uh in terms of the war I do not know Uh actually I do not really know that much about it I just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media you know Uh I guess I think it was uh uh not that great that we were in there uh in terms of for how long it lasted You know What do you think Uh-huh Uh-huh Right The devastation yeah Uh-huh Yeah And in full faction yeah Yeah it just kind of dragged on Uh I do not know how you were historically But I was a little bit older before I realized just how long it had been going on since L B J and I pa- Yeah It really well yeah in fact because in terms of when your there is at least ten years between us so in terms of when you were in school I am sure that it was you know the majority of your high school and junior high years Uh one of the things I did not like was the weapons the weapons the weaponry th- systems that they used Uh it just did not seem that uh I do not know technically we knew what we were doing either And then you heard about the things like agent orange et cetera and you would think you know just uh how could the government or the Pentagon uh who- or whomever is in charge there been so careless Uh Conscious yeah Nutrisweet yeah and all these other things That is true uh Uh monetarily too I just do not think we have done enough for the uh Vietnamese people as a whole Uh in South Vietnam in general in helping them restore themselves You know and I don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there Yeah I mean I do not think they do But I just think it is kind of a shame that uh you still hear things about the children that are orphans there and uh so on a whole I do not know war is not good And that one I probably uh my main opinion would be w- w- we should not have done it Well that is what I know about the Vietnam War Unless you Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Vietnam Jeez yeah Uh-huh And that that Uh-huh In terms of the personal Yeah The bitterness is more on a personal level than on a Uh-huh The money is after yeah I think it started actually like like in the late fifties like in fifty-eight fifty-nine So it really because I know in nineteen sixty-three I was nine years old when Kennedy was shot So I remember uh right around then that's when I first started hearing about Vietnam But then as I got older and studied in school I realized it was even going on before that You know and you think to yourself oh my goodness Eisenhower That sounds ancient yeah And I know I know you know a lot of the Vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties uh guys that I know that they are just kind of bitter you know They they you know I hate to quo- that movie BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY but it is that kind of idea You know they just do not feel that socially they were given like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome Yeah They were not given the Yeah So well I won't keep you any more That is probably as about as much as we both know But thanks for talking to me Uh yes is that where you are at Oh I know where that is That is beautiful where you are at D C yeah Are you a native of there Yeah uh Dallas it is uh ninety-two degrees here today but at least the humidity is uh below forty percent which makes it kind of like Phoenix Really Well you Yeah well you are not missing too much then Really Well take it easy Okay Bye-bye
