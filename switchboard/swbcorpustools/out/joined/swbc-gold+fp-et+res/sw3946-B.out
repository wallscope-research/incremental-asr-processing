Why don't you go ahead and start off I agree although we're in that situation right now We have a an eighty seven year old mother in law living with me right now and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently And even moving from her house to our house has been tremendously unsettling for her and we have several young children and they about drive her crazy Well we've you know we've struggled a lot with it because again most of the nursing homes I've been in are very depressing to me And she's still alert enough that I think she would really know that we were putting her there and I think she would really resent it and I think that would make it very hard But on the other hand I see my wife with I guess our youngest one now is five and her trying to struggle because her mother really cannot take care of herself She needs to be bathed and dressed and a lot of those kinds of things And so the drain on the family And when the kids have kids come you know she's always saying you know why do they have to be here why can't they send them home it's too noisy and she'll say that to the kids' friends So it's a hard situation either way I think I think that's one of the things we're really wrestling with When does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that as opposed to considering her current circumstances and Oh prohibitive Yeah Yeah I think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care that's more readily available you know I think if we could send her someplace for the day and she could be around some elderly people and have some activities would be of more interest to her and then in the evening have her return and be with the family Yeah But there's not many of those available right now and they're very hard to get them into and we tried sending her to a senior citizen center But they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's somewhat senile And so a lot of the activities that they're engaged in she can't participate in But I think it's an issue that you know with the graying of America we're really going to have to as a as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this Because it is a difficult situation and you know you hate seeing them just sort of send off and not well cared for And yet And then I think it depends on their physical ability too you know if they could be up and doing some things it might be better than when they're just sort of needing almost constant supervision and care Yeah Do you live at all close to each other
