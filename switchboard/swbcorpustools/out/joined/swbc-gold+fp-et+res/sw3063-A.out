Uh we are to discuss air pollution and uh what we think the causes are/ And I probably would uh target uh industry as being number one polluter Well vehicles and and yes Right because uh there's a lot of commercial vehicles out there especially those the big rigs like the busses and um the big uh eighteen wheelers and so forth I think they would generate probably uh one of them would probably generate enough for three cars But that's not and I think it can be resolved if uh if they really let go with the technology that they have at uh at their hand and they haven't released it yet I think there's a lot of hold back uh because of uh oh priorities that they have you know and uh it's You have some children Oh okay Do you have do you watch children or do you Uh-huh Well that's interesting Um is there anything Well temporarily they do Then we get out of that phase soon enough Oh yes Uh-huh Uh-huh sure Uh-huh Well I know uh uh in Michigan uh the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air And um of course now No and when they and you bury it and it's not gone either because it has untold ramifications And uh And it gets into into people you know which is uh the the most important um resource that we have is people and they're and they're destroying us they really are So I think the cockroach will evolve uh sa- safely So they say Yes but there's not enough And we need expert cooperation Yeah Education of the Education of the people is primary I would think And uh and we're hard to teach We are hard to teach Absolutely yeah Uh-huh Absolutely yes Uh of course uh we would like to see it accelerated because uh of the critical nature of it The the learning of it and the just to um think that way we have to be in that thought pattern and able to um motivate ourselves to um uh do what is right for the atmosphere Um I think we're all contributors every human being that lives is a contributor to pollution so we just <> um Uh-huh Well hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past That the time frame for cleaning up our air and our and our um land you know which uh we get our nutrients from You know everything goes back to the land So um it's just um very critical I think at this point to uh get that through to the people and get us educated Uh-huh I I don't know if they offer classes in uh the uh in the grade school uh uh subjecting In science okay What grade level would that be Would that be um perhaps the first grade level which would be Well are they starting though at at with the children that are so their little minds are like sponges and they can really uh relate to that Target stores Oh okay Okay Oh I see <> Uh-huh help fight the pollution Oh that's wonderful Well I'm sure that uh perhaps they're the leaders you know and other will others will pick up on their example and carry it uh further You know because uh thoughts are <> Uh-huh
