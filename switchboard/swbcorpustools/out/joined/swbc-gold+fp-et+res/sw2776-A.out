Great Um currently I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program I'm mainly do a lot of walking I have a son that's a little bit overweight and um the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around So my wife and I kind of take turns At one time I had a fairly regular exercise program But in the last couple of months I've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down All this space that normally would be dedicated towards the exercise area is covered in boxes Well I had uh a little routine that I did for warm ups And then I did some very mild say light weight lifting Nothing I'm not trying to make big bulging muscles just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age Huh-uh Huh-uh Yeah That's a plus Oh I have a total of five children I have three left living at home And they do take up a big part of my uh my evening and weekend And it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself too It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up Yes when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children Yeah You have to what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself And you can use what ever rationale you want but basically the healthier you stay the longer you'll live And uh you know if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then I'll around a lot longer And those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now well you know get the enjoyment of me years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have taken it If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine Huh-uh Yeah Oh I've done a lot of study over the years and I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water Yeah Um the research that I've done and I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three And it's amazing that uh you know prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks There were none prior to nineteen-hundred Well in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water In nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities and after that we we started having the hearts attacks and uh Dr Price wrote a book CORONARY CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE You can usually find it in a health food store I know they had it in health food stores in Plano I used live in Plano Uh Dr Price yeah And it's amazing he makes the you know it's a very small book and the guys very opinionated um but he makes a very good case against chlorine There were no heart attacks before we started using it and he points out that people in uh England and uh or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks Yeah He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours And uh proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the clogging of the arteries And uh you know he's there's been a lot of reports since then This whole thing about first it was stress then it went to cholesterol and now they're saying what's cholesterol well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol You know it's amazing what he points out in that book and in fact he everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency who did work back in nineteen eighty-six who wrote a letter to Dr Price in nineteen eighty-seven And in this letter he praised Dr Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis And E P A never published that report CORONARY CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE Yeah Yeah Yeah There is there is a lot of good information out there uh about health And a lot of the a lot of the myths they've been passing around people are starting to realize aren't true I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because that's that's good for you uh but to believe some of the things you know and I don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet but to think that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is is just hard to believe Huh-uh Yeah I actually eat pretty much anything that I want And I've had my cholesterol checked and uh a few times and I've never been above like you know one-hundred and fifty never And uh uh I Um Well what they tell me but you know everything is like within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing You know they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued But uh we've I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley Maryland Yeah and we've had a few of the health fairs up here and um you know I've always come out aces You know I'm not really that big on watching what I eat but I do eat you know some health cookies that are high in fiber low in fat and all that kind of stuff But I mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine I'm not cholesterol I'm not worried about it <>
