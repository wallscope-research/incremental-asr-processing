Okay all set Good morning Let's see music um well I play a couple of instruments I try to Um clarinet is my primary instrument and I also play a little bit of saxophone flute and piano when I get the opportunity which isn't very often How about yourself Uh-huh Uh Oh wow Wow That's great Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh So are you a professional musician Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I understand yeah I'm in one community band here and that's just well we rehearse once a week We generally have a concert every other week and Yeah That's a lot No we sure don't Well one thing is we have a summer ser- summer series and every single Sunday night we play at the library to have a little out outdoor stage set up and so we do that every Sunday night during the summer yeah and then I don't know We just have an awful lot of engagements and we're just having to turn a lot of people down um because you know uh we don't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row Oh yes definitely we really do You know you get your little Sousa book and you just flip through it and that sort of thing It really depends on who shows up Um and it's always a mystery because it actually doesn't matter who shows up it matters what instruments they brought because so many people switch instruments so often But um yeah in the winter we do more concert stuff and Um I think there's about seventy Yeah there's a lot But on any given night there's not seventy you know it alternates quite a lot Yeah it really is Oh Yeah well Oh okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah that's fun Well let's see Well there's another band around here Someone at work is trying to get me to join that one because they need clarinet players and their concert schedule isn't as heavy but they have more in the summer I think they have ten in the summer you know one one week after the other I think they're like Monday nights and they don't have rehearsals during that time period Uh well it's not really sight reading when you've done it you know again and again and again but some people are yeah some of them are Well they're in the suburbs of Dallas in Richardson and Plano We're real close to Dallas Yeah Yeah well it's more of a I think it's very much more of a social group than anything else you know And and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so and That's probably why we get so many people Um well the conductor gets paid a little bit you know we do get some money from the city because we do play at a lot of city events Um I think he's the only one that gets paid The city uh-huh Yeah it's a similar thing I can't remember what they call it but the same type of thing Um but we do get an awful lot of music you know we can borrow music from any of the area colleges or you know if some some group just isn't going to play any more they'll just give us their music and that type of thing And we do an awful lot of you know we don't charge for any of our performances but we get a lot of donations Yeah
