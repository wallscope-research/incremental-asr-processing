Than well that's interesting isn't it yeah Right What did you think about that idea They've not really given it attention either yeah Right Well I'm I'm glad I'm not the one that's that's in charge of of making those decisions They uh you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're all so serious you know it's not so serious I guess until it affects your family and then all of a sudden it's the most important thing So I I would hate to have that responsibility just personally but but then again we really we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address I uh I guess I it it frightens me to think of so many people with with AIDS and with cancer and many of those things uh if they're not able to to be insured then the country's going to pay for it one way or the other Whether it's through prevention or or treatment or you know <> just uh just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves It seems like one way or the other we're going to end up paying for it But <> Just change our p- Right just change our priorities a little bit Right
