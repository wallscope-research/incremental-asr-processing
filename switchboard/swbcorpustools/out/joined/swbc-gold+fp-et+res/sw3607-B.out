Well um done a little uh repair on the uh shingles on the roof recently We've had a lot of wind around here Yes It looks like I'm going to have to get up there again because we may have a leak We've been getting quite a bit maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio but uh well I'm right Plano's just north of Dallas and there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas that are under water right now I guess I saw on the news Well we're up uh we're north and uh oh about uh I don't know uh eighty to a hundred miles south of the Oklahoma line I guess Uh we did have a little bit of rain yesterday So far we haven't had any today And uh I suppose that means I should be uh getting up there to look at that uh shingle but uh I had something else planned today so I guess I'll let it go awhile They're uh no they're uh wood shake Yeah No I uh as a matter of fact we've never had a leak actually yet Now this we just bought the house last year and uh uh just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles So I've just recently had to start looking at it myself So it's a small problem so far but I guess you just have to keep on top of it What kind of roof do you have Oh then you don't have to do too much with it Uh-huh Oh it's pretty steep Uh parts of it are steeper than others Well uh you wear uh shoes with good traction and and and try to remember where you are at all times And remember to yell Geronimo if all else fails It's actually just twelve years old now Yeah it uh this part of the country actually they say that when the house is uh fifteen it's already old but just take good care of it Thing is we've uh the main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some uh squirming I call it of the foundation We're just on a concrete slab you know but uh the soil right under this is a clay and it uh Well it uh depending on it's moisture content it either swells up or shrinks and uh of course the soil right under the slab retains it's moisture a lot longer and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from uh from uh drooping and uh but anytime there's a change in the weather like the temperature drastic changes in temperature or in uh moisture uh you get little spider web cracks all around uh windows and doors Well usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped and then you patch them up Uh well this is all uh it's all drywall uh I think with uh yeah right But uh somehow or other that does manage to uh show these little cracks I don't know quite how that works Maybe it isn't drywall I don't really know Yeah I think it is I expect that's what it is yeah Yeah I think that's the way this is done Fortunately we haven't had any real big holes in it yet so I Yes well the previous owner had a major problem with it because uh oh probably a variety of things His neighbor used
