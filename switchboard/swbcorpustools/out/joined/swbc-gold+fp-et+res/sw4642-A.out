I uh try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair Actually uh that is really a sore spot with me I I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving but uh like ten years ago uh reliability of automobiles at least U S automobiles was pretty dismal and not only that but the uh repair capability of uh service departments and dealerships was equally dismal and uh it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea But uh I Pardon Well at that time actually I had a Volkswagen Rabbit and uh it was it was a real lemon Uh subsequently I got a uh Buick Century and it wasn't as bad But uh last year I bought a Honda Accord and I take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance and that is it And it's wonderful Huh Huh Huh So wha- what do you have All the more reason to uh have a a Honda D- so you bought a Pontiac Now thi- wha- how old is the car Huh Huh Huh So apparently it was the same one that was on there Apparently just uh re- re- uh probably filled the the brake fluid up and that was it So what's the solution to that I guess find a reputable service Huh Uh-huh Right Well that's wonderful You're lucky Oh really Huh
