Definitely Uh-huh Uh I have twice It was a pretty wild experience They were just you know small time cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know They were civil They weren't they weren't any criminal Uh the jury it was uh let me see I think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people so it was they and uh the one changed his vote at the end So it became unanimous you know after they turned it in and then he changed his mind after they turned it in but it then became unanimous Right The the other case was just traffic the and you know it was seat belt law and it it didn't even hardly go through so Yeah Yeah Well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though I wouldn't think that it does from from my from what I experienced in them it didn't you know it didn't turn out the way I planned it the way that I would think that it would go Yeah but it was you know it was jury was unorganized and it was it was just wasn't organized enough for me I'm not used to it not being organized and I just assumed that it would have been That's about what it was Yeah they well they picked one person and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have Yeah it ended up working all right Yes I I don't think that they they they educate them enough to to really know what's going on Yeah the the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer that which was uh seemingly their property It was on his property Right So they came to get it And then when they came to get it well it was on the landlord's property and he wouldn't let them take it off So and they are it was a double wide so they'd already taken it apart So they left it there and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it So they were suing him for the money and you know there's no way they could because it it was the moving company
