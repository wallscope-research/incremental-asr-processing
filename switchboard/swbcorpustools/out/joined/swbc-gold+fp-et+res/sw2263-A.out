Okay They suggested that we uh discuss what we think of when we say camping Oh I can camp just about most anyway Camping or uh motor home is nice uh travel trailer pop up Oh really Oh You really rough it then Uh-huh Do you do that very often Uh-huh Uh-huh You'd have a lot of hills in that down in that area Yeah That would be really great Pardon Uh-huh That sounds like it'd be fun Did you go alone or with a group or Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh that's great Long as it's not raining Uh-huh Really oh that would be Huh-uh Well I'm in Pennsylvania Yes Are you in Texas now Oh Okay Most everybody I've been talking to is from Texas but uh we're up here in western northwestern part of Pennsylvania Uh-huh Well you kind of know what it's like then Yeah But we've uh we've done uh many types of camping We've we've done tent camping and we had access to a motor home which is really super great if you don't want to rough it too much Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Just get you away from the everyday things that are going on We when the children were smaller we used to go to uh Delaware along the o- ocean most every year And that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks and uh we really enjoyed that Huh Oh maybe my dropping my phone Is that better Oh But Yeah Well we used to we don't as much anymore but uh we used to We kind of slowed down a little bit But uh I think the worst the worst thing is when it's raining If you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping then it can be kind of bad Uh-huh I don't think I would like that What kind Oh Those aren't too pleasant Yeah We have some of them around here You probably have more there though I would imagine Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh But you still backpacked and camped out Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing Yeah Yeah I would think I would think a cave would be could have problems like that too Uh-huh Uh-huh is your brother younger than you or Uh-huh uh-huh well that's great that'd be a lot of fun You have a lot good experiences from that Yeah Did you really What black ones Yeah That would be exciting Yeah they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them usually They're on the increase in this area Uh-huh The black bear Oh yeah Yeah the population's been really up They've uh they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much Uh-huh Yeah But uh we we really like camping I I must say that uh we ha- we really have a lot of fun a lot of memories in that from camping and uh Yeah Yeah It's just so it's a lot of work too it's uh get- you know getting ready and taking care of everything But it's um it's really refreshing So I think so Well it was really good hearing from you and I hope you get back into camping again and do a little more of it Okay Thanks a lot and you have a good day Bye-bye
