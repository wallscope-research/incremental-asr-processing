I have uh I well I used to have the opinion that there wa- that there really was not any more crime in America in the cities anyway than there was in previous centuries uh before uh simply because The reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced uh reporting methods with computers and other devices That's right and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets However I have been persuaded lately I guess simply by the uh overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime Well yeah No I am in I am in Washington D C Actually it you know I do a lot of business here and I come here quite often and and that again is a is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington Regardless of the racial makeup but it's it's real uh there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they uh Yeah Right Now just to focus on that a minute I guess uh uh when uh previous secretary of uh educa- Bennett I think his name was became the drug czar uh for uh President Bush he was going to focus on it on this area and do something about it and I see that even he was met without with with little success even though the entire I guess a a quite a bit of money and other uh planning efforts went into that Well Yes Well I I have three theories about it you know three things I have one theory and it's brought to us by two things One I I believe that this is a function of uh the violence that young people see on television and the movies And I am not just talking about you know uh role models of gu- of tough guys and gangsters and things like that I am not even I am not even convinced that maybe things like football hockey and th- th- the you know the and even baseball games now where the everything is settled with a fight You know the the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle th- the argument And and then I I am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree so I think that particularly I I was reading the other day about uh Corpus Christi Texas which has the the highest I think it's Corpus Christi that had the highest rates per hand gun death in America uh per capita the Saturday night special stuff so That that's what I think about it that's some of the things I think about it plus <> I do not know what are your views Yes Exac- well that's that's that's the impression I get you know And I and I imagine that it's you know it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society people want to it conditions people to it and uh you have to amp- it has to be even uh magnified to to attract people's attention I guess to have them spend money on something like that And I am sure that it does form role models for young for young men and young women and uh I I read now where we are you know women are arr- young women are arrested fighting with knives over over whatever whatever reason which is kind of unheard of when I was young Now I do not want to sound like an old fart but that's what seems that those things happened befor- did not happen in that manner before television And I I I I have to think that that it has some influence on it But Yeah No Oh yes Yeah Yeah Yes yes Well I I guess what I wanted to say and I stopped uh I do not know I got diverted was that that uh there's so mu- there's so much of a return from pris- to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure And and that is not emphasized I recognize there's there's over crowding problems and and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now that that's complicated the entire process What I also think that I guess it's the reflection of the society where where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to uh you know it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you where you live or I do not mean respons- attachment and responsibility I guess I mean any sort of Yes that's right Yeah I I do not know how that's I do not think it's done by uh the changes come simply by statutory nature I do not know what it really will take And I do not know if I have solutions except except to you know I am sort of a a an advocate of of uh of letting people of having free speech and I guess to curb uh television uh the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that However there does seem to be a right now in verbalizing it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort And the sacrifice is not that great Yeah Yes yes I think I think that's correct Well Texas has uh Texas has uh has always struck me I I I have lived in and out of Texas both in the service and uh uh short business stints And it seems to me they are a pretty pretty tough law and order state but that's a but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state Just citing that you know Yeah Yeah
