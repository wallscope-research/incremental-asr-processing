Okay So Frank what uh type of uh budget do you or your family have Right That's uh sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have I am single so I guess I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget but I basically Right I don't need to I am the only that I have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier Uh and also I you know I try to save a certain amount each month as well and uh I try to try to have an idea of what my expenses are and I am pretty consistent from month to month and uh whenever uh I need to uh whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah That's I guess I kind of do a similar thing More uh medium or longer range I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for Like I am probably within a year I would like to buy a new car So I kind of have a an amount in my mind and I am making every effort to to sal- put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever Right Uh-huh Huh Right Right Have you thought about uh leasing I see Right But if you are rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that You know typically you if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off Of course the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself That's right Yeah mine's uh seven years old and I think last year was that was a rough year for it I had a number of expenses But uh I am hoping that most of them were just kind of uh you know the as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brakes shocks and all that So I just went through that whole set last year I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again Right Right What line of work are you in
