Nancy do you have any children Oh Well that's nice That is lucky Well how old um does a child have to be before you have to you get to stop making arrangements for him I wonder Uh-huh Uh-huh Well and um it's nice for them not to be alone Uh-huh Not after wor- Oh no Yeah She is Well I'm glad you have that um opportunity to have your mom Well I I have two kids and uh five and six a girl and a boy and um so far I haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because um I'm at home now full time But um when I was going to school I would go to school a time that my husband wasn't you know when he was at home so that we would just switch back and forth like that But um it's really scary and I would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care Uh-huh No Uh-huh Oh Well that's nice And  I know that I have um done some babysitting myself and uh when I was in school and needed extra money And I know how I feel how I felt as a provider of child care that even though you're you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to you know treat them equally and you know better usually better than your own um it's not the same and it made me realize that um no one will love your child as much as you and your mother your and um the family and no one will look out after them and I just think um so far I think my preference would be rather than to have like a oh a big day care that um what is that like child Kinder Care and things like that rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something I would prefer to have in home care either my own home or a neighbor or something Uh-huh Right It is hard No No And I know um when I pick my kids up from school they want to come home And I and I would hate for them to have be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation So I think uh my preference would be a small small if I had to find day care would be a small someone that I knew Uh-huh No Well that's true because even now when they're gone to school it seems like there's just not enough time left over two utts in the day And uh by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time and there's just not enough to time in the day to do anything good quality for them but that's really
