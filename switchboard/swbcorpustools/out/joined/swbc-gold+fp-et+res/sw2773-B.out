Well I was it was favorable I I just I think the sanctions would have worked but it would of taken longer and uh now with all this stuff coming out with Woodward's book and everything Uh and then I saw a NIGHTLINE program last night about all the funding of Hussein's uh back as early as nineteen eighty-six so uh been a different turn and then I don't think we projected what was going to happen after the war It got over so fast so uh Well it just came out I guess yesterday It's called the COMMANDERS And it's uh it says big story in the paper about it today Bush trying to comment on it that Colin Powell was against the uh uh an early uh he was for sanctions And so it seems like there's you know always some body digging things like that But I'm not for sure we know exactly what what all happened in that situation So we were so uh fast to get over the Vietnam whatever the Vietnam syndrome is that now we've tied ourselves up there in the Middle East for a long period of time Yeah I just think I think if we had been very if we had that good of a correlation through the United Nations then they could have uh they could have made sanctions work I'm pretty sure With that much support you would have just penalized any nation that broke the embargo We are We are I think you know in + in we've just misread almost everything in that we always seem to be getting in bad with the wrong fellow for the next next tenure for the next thing down the road and uh then we can and we don't tend to read Israel correctly so uh I don't know it should be a mess It's uh not going to be anything we're going to get out of very soon Right They can talk a good game but uh being a historian it's you know you read all that clear back at least to the turn of the century with all the mess after the first world war And we just we're still I I you're absolutely right too naive we just if we do find so-called experts in any area of the world we don't listen to them so Um I don't know be be interesting to keep watching I guess but I'm just afraid it's going it's going to break us Not very much in our colleges we're trying we're I happen to teach at a college with a tremendous number of international students and and cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand and it needs to be uh taught from the earliest grades with our school systems in such disarray I don't know if that it doesn't look terribly hopeful Well you can at least uh give them the awareness of the different cultures and uh you know have all sorts of um at least you know let them know what that that other people do things differently than than than maybe in their own neighborhood So and when when when those people are around and you can get them to meet and we're all pretty much alike So uh But it's uh it's something as you know as I said won't go away so it will be a good topic for me in the class for along time Because I teach history so Well I would just think if Bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the United Nations to uh uh somehow persuade those nations to give the Kurds a homeland they were promised that Well that's the same thing they uh they haven't been waiting quite as long even though they've been waiting since forty-eight uh that that becomes a different matter simply because your dealing with Israel and they seem to be more intractable than ever Uh that Shamir can't can't retain his leadership if he if he backs down the slightest bit so uh I just don't see us I don't think there's anybody of of major stature on the scene of like the great statesman of the past or at least we thought they were I'm not for sure that they were They seem to have gotten us into some of these messes Well I wish we could stay out of it but the oil is not going to allow us to We absolutely need that oil That's the major thing If we didn't need the oil and if we didn't have the ties with the Israelis we could probably stay out of it But I'm not for sure that we're not destined at least for the foreseeable future as long as we can keep our head our own head above water to be the world leader So I Bush is probably if he can keep that correlation together especially the French and the British and the Germans and be sure that the Japanese can kick in some of their money They may just have to I don't know what type of pressure they can put on all the nations there too because now that the war is over societies have just about gone back to their own uh uh cold selves And I wouldn't have necessarily fought for the Kuwaitis they uh they're nobody likes them in that part of the world but uh it's just such a volatile area there's just no stability period Huh-uh Absolutely Yeah I think you're right I it's not our uh role to make everybody like us But it's just uh for those who have may have wanted to travel in that part of the world that are up in the age I am it's going to eliminate that for awhile I think it's going to be too dangerous to be any place in there Oh did you Yes Yeah Well I I haven't been to Beirut but I've heard what a wonderful city that it's just totally gone to uh It hasn't That's one part of the world I've been to north Africa a lot but not um I haven't been to Beirut or Syria or Baghdad Right Sure Well I think we've done them a good job today then For this little project they're doing In fact I just talked to the director awhile ago so uh he was checking to see if I was going to stay in because I've been so busy with this presidential search I haven't had a chance to really do any calling myself So uh Thank you And you continue Bye-bye
