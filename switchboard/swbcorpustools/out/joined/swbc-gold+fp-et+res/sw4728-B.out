I don't know what you drive now what do you drive now Oh okay Throw them in the back Cab Oh yeah Yeah There you go Yeah yo- Right yeah I know Yeah you're looking at I got a Toyota Four Runner I wanted a truck that I I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too so I got a Four Runner You're just like me I've never bought a new vehicle in my life No Let somebody else break it in right Yeah Right Right Yeah Yeah my my pretty much the same I I got a like I say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners and uh it pretty much does everything I need it to it it'll tow three thousand pounds so I can tow everything and it I can throw I've had eleven people in it before Believe it or not And uh it's real reliable belie- I've had it for almost four years now and up until oh say two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it And then of course two weeks ago it decided I don't know it's the strangest weirdest thing in the world but it blew a head gasket Didn't do any damage to it Uh I caught it real early Uh oh ninety-seven thousand So it's not real early No Never overheated it I smell I smelled the uh I smelled the coolant Went out and looked Saw it was saw where it was coming from Drove it right to the shop and left it off And that was it because I d- I have that and then I have a a Kawasaki motorcycle Which is actually the usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining that's that's sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle It it's a I don't know people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves I know but I bet you he really enjoys riding it Yeah So you know yo- h- when was the last time you took out took your truck out just to just to go driving Yeah And I go out twice a week on the bike so At least Just for the enjoyment But yeah the only thing I think I might get a new car not necessarily a new car but a another car uh I would consider going to a a non to a normal pickup rather than a a covered pickup like the one I've got Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had ju- just an open bed to throw stuff in I'm sure I'm sure that that's very you got one It's that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back and Right To have it out of the way Right I think they last a lot longer than anything else Yeah yeah the trucks do Uh even though you know the Jap the little Jap trucks are are good there too But so are the though I think the Chevies I don't think the Che- I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords I think they I think the Fords tend to last a little longer At least until recently A friend of mine just bought bought like a year ago It it's a really nice truck I don't like Dodges at all but one of the Dodges they have out now has a uh the Cummins turbo diesel on it Oh it's beautiful That thing that thing will last forever Oh yeah that thing's uh it's got a boat engine in it Uh-huh
