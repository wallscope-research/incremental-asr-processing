Yeah our budgeting plan includes me getting a job We're we're at the point now I go- I quit working about six months ago to start this house and I'm out of cash and I'm not out of project yet So uh I'm going to go back and do some consulting work As far as budget's concerned I'm I'm fairly fortunate Uh we've we're  right now where if we don't buy anything extra we can make it on what my wife makes So you know the project's kind of halted until then But as far as budgeting is concerned you know we have uh some pretty strict guidelines that we go for {D you know } we always put ten percent back and that's a never touch Yeah Either savings or investment one of the two but we don't ever put it in a high risk It's just always going to be there And as far as the rest of it's concerned we don't have any kind of uh what I would call extravagant expenses you know we uh we pretty much live on about eight nine hundred a month you know just travel to and from work and clothing and food and the rest of it you know we pile into the house And uh you know I'm fairly fortunate our credit cards are out to the max right now because I'm a little behind on that but uh we're still making the payments on them It's just when you see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home and do it yourself Right exactly Yeah And where I live it it's pretty scary because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up you don't get it finished the bank can eat the contractor Yeah bad for him But the homeowner can't be touched It's a homestead state Yeah see right now if I quit paying any of my bills the only thing they could do is cut off electricity They can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes Period You know They can take your car and your clothes and your anything that's not the tools of your trade but as far as uh you know you're pretty much bullet proof in this state Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Well you know we're we're not ones to budget much you know We just going to spend it all Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah yeah we're pretty pretty fortunate as far as the uh the budgeting is concerned because you know we don't have any long term debt You know uh we paid cash for car Well we bought the car on time one of them but we you know we since paid it off The land is paid for cash so we don't have to worry about that Well it's fraught with other problems Yeah I'm not very motivated Uh systems consulting Computerization for construction firms Yeah Right Oh You into mainframes An- oh really Are you really I just got that a few days ago Oh gees don't get me to lying I bought it at a fire sale This guy's place burned down and he had a bunch of computer stuff and you know I bought it all It was two hundred bucks for everything he had Well some of it wasn't worth anything you know You know a lot of the uh diskettes were just totally unusable Well yeah or wet But I did get out of there with uh Vermont Views which is a huge
