Okay Okay Uh-huh It's funny that those are my two my husband's two favorite shows too and I enjoy both watching both of them but I used to didn't like NIGHT COURT and I and the only reason I think I like it now is because I've seen it so much and I'm involved with the characters but I used to think um Dan Fielding was just too too vulgar and too crude for me And I told my husband that's the whole point but I I just it's I find him degrading at times I guess that is the point but sometimes it just Oh I think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character I haven't watched um yeah I think so which in QUANTUM LEAP you get even though the person is involved in so many other people's lives you still see a a real person in those situations He gets um he's doing amazing things but he's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do and I think that's I like that Um I think my favorite show is HUNTER And I I like the old ser- series better when um Dede was in there Yeah and um so uh uh and then the blond that they took out the one that got killed yeah I didn't enjoy her I I she was too much of a opposite of Dede and I think that's what they try to do but I think we wanted to see Dede there or somebody like her Uh-huh The second lady Uh-huh Yeah They didn't Yeah she would go her way and he would do his and I think that's what I didn't like Uh-huh Right And I like the new lady better but I'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there I'd just as soon have the the police story without all the romance Yeah I think most shows were doing that and then they went away from it and now they're starting to go back to it and maybe that's what the public wants I don't know but I just I like the the cut and dry solve the mystery and that's what I always enjoyed about it Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Just go ahead and quit the wondering and and Yeah Oh Uh-huh I didn't I was going to say I didn't ever watch MOONLIGHTING but I heard that's what killed it that uh interplay died when they got married and so the show died Uh-huh Right Halfway through Yeah Uh-huh Oh Yeah I I'm guess it's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows yeah which kind of like in the big soap opera shows which I don't enjoy because of that but I've seen it before but I don't watch it regularly Usually Tuesday nights I'm out so Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah it's funny how we uh we we romanticize people like for instance where as the teenager you know you romance a romanticize a rock star but when he gets married then you don't care any more or something like that and I think it's the same with your characters on T V Probably yeah I know it affected me when I was younger I'm not into rock stars too much lately but Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh it would have been hard wouldn't it I just the the publicity in and of itself much less the when you get married you've got relationship to develop in the first place so having twenty million people watch you do that Yeah Yeah Yeah I think we've covered our time It's been good talking to you You're the first man I've talked to everyone else has been a female so this is a change You've had a little bit of variety huh Okay well thanks so much Bye-bye
