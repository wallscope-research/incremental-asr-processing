Well Cathy I think that uh capital punishment certainly has a place in our society um maybe from the sense that there are some things that we just can't afford to have repeated even in the remote chance of repetition That might be true um I'm what I don't know is where do we draw the line Uh do we say that every one who commits murder in the first degree is liable for capital punishment if that's what the jury decides is an appropriate punishment for their crime or do we extend it beyond that Well either you know Uh I have a a nine year old daughter and there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even considered capital crimes that that I would consider basis for murder Yes it does A lot of that has to do with the cultures that we grew up in and what's termed acceptable and um to what's allowable and where are we Uh you know if we were lived in a different country then murder is not so bad But over here where we're promised the civil liberties of purs- life liberty and pursuit of happiness then taking that away is a a heinous act I don't know I believe it's uh at the discretion of the judge or jury I tend to agree with you there Um my belief is that is that um any crime that's freely committed you know freedom of choice these people had a choice of committing this crime that involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life such as rape deserves punishment by death But then I'm also told that I'm a pretty harsh person All right I can see a difference between a person who goes out to rob a store for food than a person who commits a crime to either for the thrill of committing the crime or the thrill the feeling of power that they get from it or to acquire drugs for some other acquire funds for some other illegal activity You know that second group of people falls into the group that I say give up their rights the the first guy you know I just assumed it was a guy the first person that went out to rob a store for food that to me is is a different set of circumstances where he he deserves help instead of uh loss of life That's right or with the I think I would probably lower the age to about fourteen There's some and I I certainly don't know myself but somebody needs to do a study that says at what age true and complete logical thought to include the the consideration of of long term consequences begins You know I have an eighteen year old and uh well he's nineteen now and I don't think that I saw it in him until maybe last year And I have an eleven year old and a nine year old and I don't don't see it in them yet but I'm I'm not sure where it begins
