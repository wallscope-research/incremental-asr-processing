Good morning Uh okay go ahead Yeah I understand the topic this morning is uh our policy in Latin America and you know what we've been doing down there So uh as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area it it just so happens that uh our daughter-in-law is Panamanian and uh we have been in Panama and I have worked in El Salvador and uh we visit Mexico occasionally so yeah we we do have a little information on it here but uh Oh uh-huh <> Yeah Yeah it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit that's that's for sure No I the U S policy uh towards Central America as far as uh well I kind of go back to to the El Salvador thing because Texas Instruments had a a plant down there for a while and I worked in there for a little while and at that particular time let's let's see that was seventy-three seventy-four kind of before the the uh the Civil War really picked up down there and U S policy at that particular time there was of course military assistance to uh to the government itself you know anything that's that's anti-Communist you know we kind of had a tendency to be pro It don't matter what their excesses were and I believe at the time that I was down there that uh the government uh the Salvadorian government you know really gotten out of hand yet the uh right wing death squad type situation I believe that that was beginning to form but I don't I I wasn't really aware of it's being you know terribly uh you know at the time that that I was down there I think that really kind of developed a little bit later on but uh our policies seem to be pretty much one of uh you know trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource anyway that Salvador had plenty of + and that was people We didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's it's labor because everything that T I did anyway we we shipped in and it was worked on down there assembled and then sent back here so I didn't feel that we really ex- exploiting them any No uh in the particular incidence that I was aware of now T I wasn't the only ones in there Playtex was in there was uh several other companies and uh of course we kind of concentrate on there wasn't much to take out of the country I felt like we're going in and taken all their um their gold or oil or bananas or coffee or anything like that because uh it just the only thing that they had a great abundance of was uh you know human beings and uh Yeah I understand what you say There was a uh the time that I was down there I stayed quite a a bit at the uh uh one of the big hotels San Salvador And at the time I thought there ought to be a law against American tourists Because they for the most part tend to be the most obnoxious as a as a group and I saw this in Panama also uh oh you know it's it's the uh the almost stereotype you know flowery shirt shorts camera hanging around their neck you know demanding this that and the other thing you know we're we're here and we want this and we want that and that sort of thing that's that's the stereotype that's very strong down there you know the the the you know that sort of thing I I I believe those of us who were working down there got a little bit more appreciation for you know the local uh culture I really don't believe that we were quite that bad but yet they were having to deal directly with uh you know with the uh the local people And uh but boy there is a there is a bad uh uh you know the old brash or ugly American-type situation And I saw incidences in the hotel where I just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say oh my God those are those are not Americans they can't be But there are and uh of course now I I do have to I remember one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad but it I think it's just kind of the North American situation In Panama they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long but I didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing as Panamanians are just about as as uh as as Americans as far as uh creature comforts you know they're uh they're they're every bit uh I I know when my my son was in the Air Force and he was stationed in Panama and he married a Panamanian girl and when she came up here uh you know she's y- kn- except for the language situation some of the cultures she's just about an American you know is as far as T V and and you know the the moneymaking part of it and all that matter of fact if anything she's worse But uh uh it it just there's little enclaves down there where you know Americans have a lot of influence and the local population kind of um you know sort of accepts that but I've also seen the other side of it too Well you were in Peru Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh <> What uh what area did you live in Oh okay yeah I've heard of it Well is are they is Peace Corps still active down in there Uh-huh Oh has those influences lasted do you know whether the the things that that you and your groups before you did did those did those live on or were they reabsorbed or how Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Well that's that was kind of the the aim wasn't it to get it started and then have it taken up by the oh okay o- so you know well that's I had wondered sometimes I knew that there was a lot of a lot of effort and a lot of work went into a lot of that and I just wondered if if it lasted and if it took you know like uh r- Uh-huh <> Oh Yeah my brother-in-law teaches at uh Northern Illinois University and they were in China here a couple of years ago and he was over there at uh the University of Shah and and teaching
