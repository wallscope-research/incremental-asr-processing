Uh I think it's a real good concept Uh drug testing procedures would have to be refined From what I've seen on the news there's a a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy poor procedure in uh drug testing Yeah Uh there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their in their uh test but they didn't know for sure what it was but it was a drug so they got turned down and uh turns out it was a prescription Or people getting somebody else's blood test Same sort of problem that happens sometimes is these some of these uh like AIDS tests and such Yeah Oh yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah <> Yeah I not very long ago worked for Wal-Mart and about a year and a half ago they instituted a uh a uh drug testing program uh well drug and alcohol testing program It's it's not a random through the s- it as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a a blood test Uh but I think the big problem though is is they send these off to large labs and then they have thousands and thousands of samples that uh going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up things like that It's Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Sam's is part of Wal-Mart Yeah Oh yeah Company's that was a great place to work Uh-huh Yeah they got to had two or three years in with them you can start buying stock and you have a have a little taken out of your check each each payday to put against + uh {F uh stock portfolio Uh not portfolio just you know against Wal-Mart stock But uh you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while Uh you're supposed to get five minutes Uh do you have any idea uh let's see you were you were tested for drugs as you got into T as as you got into T I Yeah Uh now uh were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through or Okay <> Yeah Yeah Yeah They they it was after I was already working there and they weren't testing any of those who were already working So
