<> Okay I I guess first of all I'll just say we haven't done much uh gardening We do lawn work all the time But uh our gardening we lost remember the last two freezes I don't know how long you've been here But we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones And so as far as our bushes we don't have any but we do have some blackberry bushes And and they were really hearty and stayed on and we've done really well with them Uh-huh Yeah And so they've been really good and the kids I had to the first year I had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries But uh we go out it it's hard to go out when it's this hot And uh but uh keep the weeds out of them and and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them And they're okay Yeah uh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah uh we have some flowers that have they're just are real hearty also and they're bold and they come up every year but uh they're getting too thick I need to go thin them out And uh there's a I don't know what kind of flowers they are They're real common around here They're they're orange and they look like a lily sort of Uh Yeah No but I think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in They they keep the the rain on the outside little rain drops and and they look real pretty after the rain And so I really like them but I need to get out and and um do that Now as far as our grass it grows crazy here It just keeps growing and growing and uh sometimes my husband does it and sometimes my son does it But it just is I don't I don't know I've lived in Utah my whole life and we can't seem to get ours green I don't know Yeah Uh-huh Crappy I know we have that too Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh dear No Uh-huh Had somehow gotten in Yeah Yeah Uh-huh The the other problem that we have well it's funny because the one the two bushes on the ends of the house that I think are ugly they lived and so I I don't know So like I wanted to go out and kill them too They had no right to live But anyway uh under our trees we get a a north sun and uh the it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them And we just can't grow uh grass underneath there Uh-huh Yeah Right It's a vicious cycle isn't it It just really Well I don't we've never done anything like this but we've been thinking you know if we built up uh you know either a wood wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either flowers or or some new bushes in there that would live And so I think that we're going to try that I I think the <> I think that's pretty much what we have decided Now I have two long windows and I'm trying to decide whether to put like bushes in front of them or not You know maybe just halfway up the window or something like that So people can't see and hear too much Yeah Yeah That's what our two rooms are on the front too with these long windows One is a bedroom for our our oldest son and one is uh an office that my husband and I work in And so I I really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that well the flowers are out by the back of the house so and that's why the front room is So that's not too bad But I like to look at the flowers They're pretty Yeah But it's funny because uh you try so hard I think sometimes to to anyway I do to do our yard and then it's like the wind blows <> everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them or and so even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few months it would all be back and It's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work Uh-huh I know It is it's not my favorite thing in the world either I'm glad I have an old enough son to do it for me now Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Well that is one chore that we will pay him for if he'll go do the yard work out outside so Yeah Right Exactly Exactly <> <>
