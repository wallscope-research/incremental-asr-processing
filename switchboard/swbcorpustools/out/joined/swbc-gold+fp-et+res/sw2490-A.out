Okay well what do you think Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Right That's true Right That's true Right But Uh-huh Yeah but he has to go out and do it That's true I think Right And see that's my only problem with uh making you um you know get the check and everything is is I guess bad guys if you want to call them bad guys they are going to get a gun no matter what They're not I don't think they're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check I think they're going to go out and find it someway individual sale or something like that Yeah I hope That's true Knife exactly He's going to do what he wants to do That's true I I just think it makes honest people more honest and Right Right And if you have to have it in a hurry something's wrong That's right That's right Well I'm married to a policeman so we we talk about this a lot Yeah Yeah Yeah I was watching a worried about that Yeah they do They do Right right or even even the um the little um toy guns look real  I've heard so much about that on TV and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one Yeah Right Uh-huh Right you can't blame them It looks like they've got a weapon That's right Exactly Right and I think that's a good idea That's right I know Right right A gun is a gun to them They can play with anything and make it a gun That's exactly right Right Right Exactly That's right That's a good idea I was uh watching T V yesterday and there is a town in Georgia and it's the law that you have a gun every adult you know uh is able to carry a gun and and they encourage it Yeah And the police love it Which really surprised me and and I think and that's what they were going after uh they went to interview this town it's a little dinky town they went to interview them about the gun control laws and uh the police said all the people said that's fine we could care less You know we're all honest and everything like that we we all carry them but we we don't mind being checked And uh and I think it kind of took that uh neatness away from it you know like well heck everybody's got one you know and So it was it was quite unusual to see the people in that town Uh-huh Right Exactly Uh-huh Yeah Right That's what we're doing Oh yeah Oh Uh-huh Well that's neat Well that's real neat Yeah Right Well that's real good Right Right And they usually are real basic common sense things I know and people don't want to believe that Yeah well see I In the chamber That's exactly right Yeah well we we're trying to teach our daughter She knows real well about uh about her Daddy's guns what not to do and what to do around them Yeah um and and she and she's real um she'll know she'll even tell her friends don't ever touch my Daddy's guns or something like that So she's real she's real good about it And she's never been curious cause he's always you know if he has them out cleaning them you know she can be there and he'll tell how he's doing it or you know show her the insides or stuff like that to be feared and Right exactly Right they'd have that respect for what it does and what it can do Uh-huh Oh yeah still Uh-huh Right He's got to go to a lot of trouble Yeah hold on hold on He's in here somewhere I know he is Yeah Well I know how to use one We we go hunting every once in a while and he showed me how to use his guns and I really enjoy it but boy if someone did break in I don't I don't know that I could or would even grab it Uh-huh That's true Yeah Yes Yeah Right True True well we we have dogs that are pretty you know very protective you know Yeah if they're stupid enough to come through then Yeah Yeah They've got to be pretty stupid and and most people that uh break in or whatever go to houses without the dogs luckily Right And that's one of them so Well Yeah Really does Well do you think we've Me too on gun control Yeah I think we are Right Right I'm glad you're not Okay Well good You too thanks Bye-bye
