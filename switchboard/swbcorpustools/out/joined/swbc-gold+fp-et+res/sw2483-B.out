Okay No I'm not And I think a great number of students who got word of it and participated in general and voiced who heard about the program I rely primarily on uh newspaper combined with television Uh Okay That's rather interesting I'd I'd have to say I haven't either I listen to the radio uh probably g- five or six hours a week but almost inevitably to a station that is a classical uh station here for music purposes We don't use the radio as a wake up we have our a television connected to a uh uh electronic alarm uh system that kicks in and it comes on with C N N in the morning That we we wake up to television news and uh uh shower and dress and whatever to that and then because of the fact that my wife and I ride to work together uh in a car we we chat at each other rather than than something else Uh and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in in the car so we have the advantage of being able to uh read and drive although there seems to be from what I've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving So we we rely pretty pretty heavily I think on a combination of the of the two I also uh use uh NEWSWEEK magazine Uh we tend to alternate between NEWSWEEK and TIME and whatever happens to be the the uh news magazine of the year for us and uh I read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other you know trade magazines and uh uh such as that uh where I might read the the occasional social and even current event commentaries and and everything as diverse as A C M to uh uh some of the uh some of the other tabloids I get So uh I guess I use about eighty percent written is probably my input and twenty percent uh television I I think I respect the from a journalistic perspective current events I've always said that it it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline Uh other than that it was a at best Uh we're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in Raleigh There there are other uh uh I'm not sure what you would call them they co- the small uh competing independent sort of newspapers Little small weekly things but there's only one daily uh called the NEWS AND OBSERVER fondly referred to here by some as the uh uh sometimes the Noise and Observer Uh it depends It it's has decent national coverage but has an extremely focused political coverage probably steeped in the southern history and the fact that this is a Democratic State And uh consequently everything is filtered through that uh Republican Democratic sort of glass almost unnecessarily so Yeah we we have that is uh as a matter of fact they update it once a week with a special section we and we pay it sort of glancing nod We uh have a very good friend who is uh tapped into the city planning structure Uh our developer architect friend and Right So I think we find out what's happening in the city uh on a fairly frequent basis over a over a gin and tonic sort of thing Uh and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of Raleigh than than the paper would have anyway Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Is that right I I'll heard there was some stuff on the on the radio that was equivalent to C N N Okay Okay Oh That didn't uh Uh-huh Uh we probably were listening to C N N fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began Uh we almost live and and breathed it for because during the war itself to the point where we began to sort of have household pact of lets turn the war off and get something done Uh almost an addition uh and and and we could equate or relate relay well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in in unhooking uncoupling from the events and going on with their So instead of being watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever Uh and because of that we began towards the middle and of the war I guess about two and a half or three weeks in we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would uh watch uh fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news or our local news We would watch C N N until six thirty then we would watch uh a rotating network news of either uh A B C C B S or N B C and we we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one And we would watch the first fifteen minutes and then we would turn the television off and we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on on news that way And then we would do a similar thing uh at uh ten forty-five because uh C N N would be wrapping their hourly coverage up and then we would get the local coverage uh and then I think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would would have better state coverage rather than local coverage Uh three of the networks here on their local news uh that if if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who murdered who or stole what from whom And that was the sort of thing that I would say is the best and not news unless there's some trend or something that says Jesus this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever Uh that's that's sort of more of of a pattern news
