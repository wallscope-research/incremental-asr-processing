Well I was just wondering if you had had any experience with um the care of the elderly Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Well that's nice No It's really sad It's really a sad situation And uh I think a lot of people struggle with I I guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever you know the parent is doesn't always want the in-law living in the house Is that right Well that's really sad Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yes Well I know when the I remember being a child and my grandmother had had se- several strokes and things and that we had my parents tried to keep her in the house and they did for a long time I couldn't tell you how long until she got uh where she had to have complete care and so they couldn't you know keep her in the house anymore and it was really hard on everyone She had to have you know twenty-four hour a day care And I don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house And that um they put her there and we all went just constantly until she died But it was very hard on everyone to see you know grandmother be like that and I don't know that you know I don't being so young I don't remember why You know what was why she had to go there Uh-huh Well I do remember that she was you know totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way And that that they couldn't they found that they could not you know give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed No but like you say there is a tendency for people to be abandoned though you know in the nursing home I do remember the other patients there uh being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother because they got some interaction with someone Uh-huh Right right And I guess that's hard on people to give give up their lives If they're busy they don't you know It's easy to abandon people because we do have the nursing homes I guess If you can afford them But anyway Well I'm glad it worked out good for your family
