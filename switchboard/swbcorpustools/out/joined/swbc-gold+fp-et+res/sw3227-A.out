Okay well um I um I was thinking about it for a long time and I like basically almost every form of music and type of music Um I don't have a whole lot of dislikes I um like jazz um especially the blues and uh I like uh a lot of the uh of course the classics um everything back from Bach and and Beethoven and Chopin and um just in general everything Um I enjoy uh a lot of the the modern forms um uh Right right Uh well that gets some of the punk um when I was in high school that was uh one of the big things was punk music and uh a lot of it is has a lot to say some of it has a lot to say the music does the lyrics do but the the actual Uh well it it's it's it really expresses some of the opinions of of the people who enjoy the music um but as far as a musical art form I just don't see a whole lot of art to it Um Um some of it um it depends I like uh the rap the two types of rap I like I enjoy to listen to and one is the the rap that is just funny um and they usually do a lot of satire um Right Right the monotonous the monotonous no that's not I don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about well I'm better than you and blah blah blah I don't like that I like the funny satire and then some of it is some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our in urban society It really does It talks about um race relations and police relations and um that that Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that's that's about my opinion of that It's it's okay um Um The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is is doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it the one country and western song sounds like every other country and western and so the the musicians don't get to really get into their music They just play a certain number of chords the drummer plays a certain beat and you have a country and western song and Um Right Yeah And I can't say that I like a lot of the modern the very very modern uh rock and roll but I I definitely I really enjoy the fifties the sixties and a lot some of the seventies rock and roll and uh I really enjoy especially the sixties
