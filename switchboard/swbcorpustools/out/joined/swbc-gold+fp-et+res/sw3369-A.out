Well have you seen a new movie lately Uh-huh Okay I uh I haven't seen either one of those Uh what what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though Well maybe you uh you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES Okay What did you think of that one Uh-huh Yeah I uh I just moved down in fact from South Dakota in in June and that's when the movie was filmed and uh we when when the movie came out we went uh my dad lives in the state capital which is Pierre and it was filmed right outside of Pierre In fact the buffalo the scene the big buffalo herd scene that was that was a live scene Uh there's a guy that has got a a buffalo farm and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and and uh we my dad has got a little plane we flew over it all a- looked at the buffalo it was really neat But uh so we are watching the the movie in the movie theater in Pierre and uh just every time I would start to get into the movie and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell hey there's John Red Eagle you know or you know they'd start recognizing people Yeah So I kind of I think I enjoyed it more when I when I watched it on video cassette than I did uh in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that I'd go now now which one could that be you know and I'd I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of of picking up the overall Right Exactly So but I I thought it was a good film But you are right I think I think it was very one sided Sure Right In fact I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night and it was a similar uh situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking a an army fort Um but it was an interesting movie Uh have you seen PRETTY WOMAN Now I thought that was a good show Yeah It didn't uh it didn't have any real social bearing or uh and it wasn't really a comedy but it was an enjoyable movie It was it was kind of like the STAR WARS s- series you know just something a little different yet believable Uh now are you are you going to see do you are you much of a STAR TREK fan are you going to see this next one that's coming out Have you seen the rest I think I've missed one I'm not sure but I think I've missed one Was that here in Dallas Okay Because we had one here in Dallas Uh-huh
