Okay do you have any advice for college I'm I'm I'm full of advice I'm still a graduate student So  Yeah  that's interesting I went to a a liberal arts school actually at first and you weren't really even they didn't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were in your second year and then you you know you had I think you had to pick it by by by the end of the second you had to pick some sort of major but until then they didn't sort of force you They they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then Certain requirements so that so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything so it wasn't that specialized So that Yeah Yeah Uh-huh I was just on a committee recently actually sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science trying to sort of you know where where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together you know because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts and then the other way around as well people are getting pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues So Uh-huh Well that must be helpful That could be very helpful Yeah well I figure that that that's probably the thing I would most tell any parent you know to tell their kids I think probably make sure the kid goes to a school where they get sort of a general education and save specialization I guess for graduate school unless they're sure they want early on they want to do something like engineering or something Or they can  Yeah but but that's a good idea Well where I am right now actually I'm at the University of Rochester and that's a pretty good engineering school I think I think we do some they have pretty good engineering here They also have pre- a fairly large liberal arts college as well A sort of a separate you know arts and sciences college and I believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in in everything and I know people I do I do work in language processing and + and and at least one person who's in my field started off as an engineer started off as an elec- elec- an electrical engineer student and then switched over at some point into language processing because he found that he enjoyed it more So they do force them people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here which I think is wonderful Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah <> Uh-huh  uh-huh That would be very good actually Right you you don't need any philosophy at all in school Uh-huh Or so- yeah or or or or some other thought provoking area you know Very true We had when I went to undergraduate we had went to Brandeis don't know if you know of it or not we had a requirement freshman year of just Humanities Then you were given a choice of you know there were ten or twelve or whatever fift- or fifteen different courses that you could take but they all centered they all came out of Philosophy English and Literature departments and they were they were they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read you know for so the first year Humanities courses everyone had to read the Iliad an and so forth and what they did do was they all approached it from from very different so that you could have one class in the philosophy of something that the philosophy of Greek mythology or something that actually approached this or one literature you know or a a literature course or just all sorts of different perspectives on it and people got to choo- pick and choose but but by the end everyone had a good sample of of of sort of how to think about these things nonscientifically you know and and that sort of forced them But I believe that that that you one of the one of the best things to do at least for me in school was was I was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses I was forced to take I think you know some sort of art history course and we all grumbled about it at first but then afterward we all wound up taking extra art history classes because it just seemed like something something we didn't totally know nothing about but just enjoyed very much doing and something I would never would have done if if I wasn't forced to take it Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh And that and that really is something that that I notice like I talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized and they don't have that They just you know they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take and that was all They never had some of the more fun classes I guess I feel a little more worldly now Yes I'm I'm I'm hoping I'm hoping Yes I I graduated college in eighty-seven and I just went straight through I'm finishing up next year So yeah I didn't take any break or anything yet I've been trying actually in graduate school I've been trying to do the same thing take courses out- completely outside my area and I'm finding in graduate school it's a lot harder because I just don't have the time any more to sort of sit in a course that I'm not getting graded for Whereas before I would just sign up for credit for it now I can't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily So I have to try and go myself and I went for like two or three weeks and realized not enough time for the work unfortunately I'm pursuing a Doctorate in Psychology So I'm just wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead what else I I think I Oh Uh-huh You had real world experience in the middle there And that helped you think Or that was Uh-huh Yeah I'm getting some of that I have I have sort of some work experience My wife is not an academic at all My wife is sort of in the real world and so I sort of hinge halfway out in the real world and I getting you know real world Especially she works in she works in the she works for a temporary agency ac- and I never would have had she's the office supervisor I never would have had any I've I've learned much just sort of by watching her and her and her business as well So yeah so I I can I can see where that might be a Yeah That's my yeah Yeah agreed agreed Well I'll I'll take that I'll take that and think that through a little bit Yes Uh-huh
