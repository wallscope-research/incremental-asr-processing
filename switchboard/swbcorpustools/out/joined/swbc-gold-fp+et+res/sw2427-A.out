peppers radishes and turnips I mean not turnips carrots beets and things like that My wife used to plant a few snow peas I don't really care for snow peas Well she just plants a few for herself Yeah Did you really I see Okay We don't start anything indoors we just wait until you know the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground Probably so Yeah you can get a head start on it <> I guess it it might would yeah Uh-huh Well it will make it will make them taste better I'm sure Sure You got to inspect it yeah Sure Sure Yeah No I this is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system

long or something That's right That's right I'm I'm kind of bad about that I enjoyed having a lawn service but now I have the time and I really can't I really don- you know don't want to spend the
