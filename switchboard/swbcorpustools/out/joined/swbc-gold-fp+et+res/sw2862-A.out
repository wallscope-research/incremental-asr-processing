Well did you get a chance to watch any of the games okay Yeah No I don't think so because I saw just a little bit of the game today and he was out there playing Although I what I saw was at the end of the first quarter I think he only had like eightch- eight points at the end of the first quarter they thought that was big news So I don't know but I don't know who won and I don't know who do you normally pull for the the Mavericks or yeah jeez Yeah because that's just dollars right out of the franchise man Now I I I've always been pulling for the Lakers for a long time And not just not just because they always win but when they had Akeem anybody who was old as that playing that well you know I just kind of had to go with them Now they kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players and course all the people that follow the Lakers and everything out there in in California and it also helps when they were winning I was I always wondered that you know I I will take a look at the individual score you know in the individual stance in the N B A and you know they they have in the paper you know like fifteen different categories and they'll have like a individuals they'll have the the highest scorer the top rebounders assists foul shooting percentages and all that and you go down through and virtually every one of the categories there isn't a Laker in the top ten usually hardly any any anybody in the top twenty except for like Magic and yet the Lakers continue to win So you're right I think they do really play much better as a team than they do each one you know individually at their spot <> But Yeah Well I understand that I guess Boston's really giving are aren't they playing Detroit <> I think Boston's playing Detroit and I think they're really giving them a run for their money Did he get hurt again Yeah yeah I tell you what I guess it's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy Yeah yeah He ought to have his own bed come along with him you know yeah yeah Yeah matter of fact I watched him on T V you know sink I don't know a jeez it was like thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or something like that from three point range Unbelievable I don't know did you ever play much basketball Yeah It really is for a noncontact sport quote unquote Yeah really Some of those guys got pretty funny looking eye wear Man Yeah Several years ago when I was up in Cleveland I was staying at the Marriott and the Cavaliers were playing somebody I think it was like Utah or somebody like that and I was down by the pool and there was all these guys standing around about chest deep in water Now I wear contacts and I I had my glasses on and I went down there and and just jumped into the water where they were and it went right up over my head and I came up spittering and sputtering for air and they were all the basketball players there to play the Cavaliers they were all like like six eight and you know six ten and they were standing in water that was like six foot you know and it was it was funny I tell you I saw I saw a guy I don't remember what his name was but he got on the elevator and he had his swimsuit on and he was just skin and bones you know it looked like something out of Africa and I made some comment and he says yeah he says I weigh about two hundred and forty pounds but he says it's not much when you stretch it over seven foot one So you're right those guys really you know the the big ones I don't even know how much Ewing weighs But he's got to be way up there God That's a that's a lot That's a lot of a lot of guy coming down on you Jeez I didn't even see who's who's supposed to have the the the best draft picks Yeah yeah I used to go down to Reunion Arena went down there a couple years on the day of the draft and that was really pretty interesting They usually have you know a video highlights of the season you know and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the Mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage both the good and the bad I I don't know I haven't I didn't go down there last year but it it was only like a couple dollars to get in and it was really kind of interesting <> But so who do you thinks going to win the playoffs Chicago and let's see Golden State and the Lakers and Chicago and Philadelphia think Chicago's playing Philadelphia and then the shoot I can't remember them all now Right Yeah yeah N B A playoffs Philadelphia was favored by one point over Chicago and the Lakers one point over Golden State and Detroit by five over Boston <> Jeez Think so I tell you what those guys really hang tough Now I I'd like to see them back up there again They really they really gave some some really good years of of enjoyment and fun and everything Have you ever been up there to Boston Garden Well I don't know is that in I I haven't really gone to a lot of games live but boy I'd sure like to Basketball's gotten to be a lot of fun
