It's it's hard topic because is is is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like I do Well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to high school Yes well yeah I am A- actually I think that I higher level education I don't think there's so much of a problem there It's pretty much funded well There are small colleges that I'm sure are struggling but it's the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that I see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if I lived in New York City or Washington D C I would seriously consider moving if I had a child I wouldn't let them go to a public school system there But of course people are trapped economically and they can't do that Well that's really too bad because it it's giving some people unfair advantage I mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in Florida what we learned Yeah Yeah Like they have that down there that Yeah it's like if if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school Yeah that's true I was fortunate I'm a I'm a technician and we had a vocational electronics in our high school So when I went to my first year of tech school I had a very easy time because our high school had a a good program Yeah I find that that the that in the in the cities it's more like the kids go there so socialize not really to learn and the parents send them there because they're supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair And I also find that that you can send a kid to school but if don't work with them as a parent I think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage Yeah well I could I could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if t- they're you know come from a broken home and they're parents are more concerned about trying to work sp:their and or maybe they're unemployed and they're mad at the world I can see where that wouldn't be very good for a a kid you know he's coming up will you help me with my homework and they're no get away from me I've had a terrible day So it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from Yeah are they going to move to Mexico Uh-huh On the Yeah maybe the maybe they'll bring their good schools with them You know if the industry comes hopefully they'll promote good schools Because I know the town that I come from the the the large I B M plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one and plus for for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists They're they're you're most likely to do better in school They're going to help you Yeah you hope Well I think I I don't know I just think it it's it's a duty of the parent to do that I mean jeez my parents always helped me and I don't know it's just like you say it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in I can see some lady she's twenty-one years old and she's got four kids A kid in her first grader I don't see where she's going to have much time for them So <> I don't know It's just like I don't know Actually I think it's I think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and t- to see what they need and not overinflate it like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go now hey wait a minute we're in a recession here We our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession and they're even though we've enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent unemployment when it used to be four or five People are going whoa So Yeah but I always see it's all it's all money This like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime It it's it's all money based And what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school Who knows bu- maybe we do we need some more Catholic schools support the church instead They seem to have done a the good job in the past In some places you couldn't go to a public school It was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school so Yeah I don't Yeah I don't know if I would do that to my child though But so pretty much though see I don't have any good ideas or or anything that would contribute See this isn't a subject that I think a lot about because I'm never faced with it because our school system in Vermont it seems to do a really good job Is it Well that Well So you have to go to a lesser engineering school We have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot It's a very good school It's it's University of Vermont we also have some two year college Well there's a four year colleges They all have a pretty good reputation But like you say you
