Well with credit cards is me I I try to get maybe just one or two I don't I don't like having credit cards for every store I I I just don't like them What am I afraid of I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much I just don't think that I need them you know I they are tempting at times but I I just you know sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing everything about me you know so So and th- you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money so Yeah Uh-huh That's right See they make money off of it whether you use it or not That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh That's what I do That's what I do Just a second <> Sorry I have two little ones Yes Yeah So tha- four and two and half Yes So yeah I'm I'm like you I I use my only use my credit card for you know when I you know I just use it whenever I feel like I don't want to write a check and then but I don't charge anything that I can't payoff at the end of the month So No I never do My husband does at work just to get cash out but I take the checkbook so I you know I just if I need cash I just tell him and he gets it out and I don't even think I know my number Uh-huh That's right See we he couldn't do without it h- but you know since he can just do it right there at work for nothing Yeah Uh-huh You're right And that's kind of silly Yeah Your defeating the purpose Yeah Yeah Yeah I mean I get I get at least one or two a week People t- you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and I just say I don't want it Because I Yeah It's like I'd like to know where they determine that I'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line You know You've already been preapproved Yes Everybody in the country is preapproved I think So Yeah Uh-huh Yeah And then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find wow I didn't realize I had this much you know I'd spent this much money And then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it Uh-huh Yeah it does because you're you know you you're you know you're just co- costing yourself more money because you if you can't make the monthly the minimum payment you're paying interest again so Yeah so Yeah It's enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way so well You you too Good luck Bye-bye
