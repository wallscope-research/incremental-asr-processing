with regard to to jury trials I you know I I really feel as though jury trials are are whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use Because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on you know on accumulated n- body of law And if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start going back and digging up all these cases that that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards So I I really don't think it they can really do much of anything to change it What do you think Well won't well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that but then then you know the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently and you know the other two guys sat in the car and they didn't get beat up You know Rodney got beat up because he he you know he pur- you know he involved himself in some sub self-destructive behavior And just like the burning and looting is self-destruct Everybody says well this is the nineties and they're going to rebuild and it'll be even better Hey what do you think you know some some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area With everybody with that mind set They they're they're going to that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto you know and you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know Well e- everybody is saying this is going to be a new era and we're going to reexamine this thing Hey the b- the average person is going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed They're a bunch of animals you know How can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything Forty deaths I mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that And I'm just trying to determine you know how you address how you weigh you know Rodney getting getting the hell beat out of him against you know forty deaths Yeah And there's no other I'm not su- exactly sure what the circumstances surrounding the deaths And I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and and pursued it you know because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing Is it a looter that got shot by a store owner I you know no tears Yeah And and so I but I I suspect a number of them You know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in in the street And and my reaction is I would have run over fifty people before rather than stop And and there there would have been just nothing but carnage after after after if I'd been at the wheel No one would have stopped me Right I'm inside the beltway You know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus and so and I say well wait a minute I'm inside the beltway and I don't think like that I'm a government employee I'm with the F B I Yes An- and so and and the reason I'm doing this whole thing is because Rick whose another government employee wanted a spe- segments of my speech that that were done a year ago and he wanted another collection a year later And so this is my seventh call A year ago I did eleven calls And so that's that's why that's why I'm religiously getting on the phone because I have a unique you know I have a unique situation here in that if I don't participate
