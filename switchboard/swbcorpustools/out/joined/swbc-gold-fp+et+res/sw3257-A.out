What do you like to watch on television Yes Uh-huh uh-huh Well we have cable but we only have Cinemax and I think our favorite night is Monday night and we start out with EVENING SHADE and MAJOR DAD and I think that's the one night that we really try to watch television You know my husband's always got it on I'm not always sitting down and Yes Yes yes I just I love that all those that two hours and now tonight I just finished up with that A WOMAN CALLED JACKIE did you watch did you watch it Yeah it it was pretty good it sometimes I like a dramatization and I like U S A when they had their mystery movies and things their made for T V movies and I like those We very seldom watch any Public Television Channel Thirteen Do you watch it much Yes Yes it is should this be two slash units/ Now we haven't watched any of those Yes now we have watched some things on that Yeah we had I don't know my husband loves to that male syndrome of flicking that channel so you know and he's sit in front of it and and he went by and he said Whoops and he backed up and you know there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner you know and I'm saying let's move right on But our grandchildren like that Discovery Channel if they're over here because lots of times it will have things on animals and they just thoroughly you know enjoy that in fact I think they were watching something on whales or killer sh- sharks one or the other couple of weeks ago over here and so we have watched that and otherwise of course my husband's into the football and you know I will watch that some if I'm reading or doing something else you know with him Yes Yes and sometimes now we're getting that the other football where they play it inside and you know this is a you know this is too much Saturdays and Sunday this is fine but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring you know all of that and but he will he'll flip around I think the other night we had on it was a it was car races some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down I don't know what channel he found that on and but he will turn that on especially for if again if our oldest grandson is over here He's ten and they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it I you know I keep telling them it's the same mentality you know and something's wrong and but and we very seldom watch television on a Friday night or Saturday night because we're not home and so and Sundays we usually have all of our kids are over on Sunday so you know we don't get into that except that sometimes we'll get into their home videos do you ever watch that Yeah uh-huh that are sometimes so dumb But very true to life I mean I've seen our family in several of those situations
