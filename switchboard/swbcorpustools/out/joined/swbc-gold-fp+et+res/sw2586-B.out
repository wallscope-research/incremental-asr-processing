yeah My dad has a lake cabin and so we go there for the small lake just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area It takes us about three hours to get there And we go and we fish and we catch a bunch of junk Nothing nothing to talk about for the most part but it's fun From the dock from shore mostly we catch carp If we're doing good we catch a catfish or two once in a while And you know we go ahead and eat those But we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry What we normally do is just go ahead and clean it up and then you know put it in a bag and freeze it And and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd Usually there's a pretty good crowd there so we don't ever catch enough to eat Carp is usually pretty much fun Because I've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little you know a little pole with twenty pound test line And that that's a pretty good fight So that's a lot of fun Yeah They fight hard Yeah Yeah and in the rivers and stuff Are they good to eat you mean size wise they're not very big Yeah Well I've been is that mostly fly fishing when you're doing that or Are you fly fishing or are you using a bobber Yeah I've never even tried that My if I don't have a reel with a button on it I tend to get so much backlash it's not worth the trouble Uh-huh With the little thing on the end Yeah I thought it had a weight Oh Uh-huh  Uh-huh So you're fishing downstream so it will carry some you fish upstream Uh-huh You hope that they think it's a bug and and eat it Yeah That's a fish it's a it's a lure I see Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh  Did someone just come up with this design and and you're going to make one for yourself or are you going to buy it Uh-huh it's just that that just happens to be what the fish like this year huh  I guess so We tend to use just bait And a few lures but bait tends to work the best just some blood bait are you Where are you from I'm from Midland I went to college at Tech so You've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing Yeah I've been up there I didn't catch anything but I've been up there Yeah it's fun It's lazy Take a picnic lunch I used to do that with my dad Every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day Before it got too hot Yeah Yeah we do most of our fishing at night Just from the heat of it all That's one advantage you've certainly got on us It does I've only been up there once In the summer Well no I've been up there twice in the summer But both times it was really pleasant In fact it snowed on us in in gosh when was that We were in Mesa Verde Park and it was like the end of Ju- It was just before July fourth And it was twenty-eight twenty-nine degrees We were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags not knowing any better And here it went and it froze and it snowed on us We did not know what to do about it Yeah Uh-huh Do Yeah Do you have to do you wear waders when you fish Oh Goodness it must be a little bit cold That's cold water around there Do you have any I see Yeah And you get you get a little more carried away with it and you move a little closer Yeah Do you have any kids that you take fishing Uh-huh Yeah I have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old And the little one of course is could care less The three and a half year old has just gotten to the point we got him a little pole last year and just put his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up That was what he considered fishing This year he's gotten to where he can We we were at a friend's stock pond we were out at their farm and and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we wal- we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish And he started trying to cast it So he he was kind of getting there but he's He's at a dangerous point right now He understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in Yeah Yeah Well that's good yeah My husband would like to live there but I don't know All of our family is here so Well yeah but T I is up there so that part of it would probably work out I'm sorry what We're both I was military but he's division three It goes back and forth Division well maybe division one right now He's in computers So And he's in school and everything else I have some friends who work up there Kathy and Kevin Guy Yeah And they like to fish They've been inviting us to come up there in the summer Her dad has a cabin and they go fishing up there So that would be neat to try it some time Yeah long as you have a good time that's the main point so Uh-huh Definitely more to look at Yeah Yeah The only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up We camped next to one one time when we were there a couple of summers ago And we figured we were up a long way off And then it rained that night and we thought well wonder how far off we are And we got up the next day and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away And it's like well maybe we ought to move just a touch So that was kind of funny Yeah I just love the way it looks I could almost just watch the wa- we in fact we have gotten out on on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much and if you were there I mean it was one time we were there and I guess it was late May so it was really your spring almost you know at even though it was it was really summer down here And and the I guess the creek the mountains were really starting to melt and the creek was just wild just running And and all the white water and noise and the it was just beautiful Uh-huh Yeah
