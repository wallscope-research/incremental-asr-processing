Well I take it since you selected this topic that you have children You don't My goodness So Well I have two daughters and they're past this they've been latchkey children for a while and they're almost where I can start saying they're you know young adults so I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask or expect Well if I were look- Exactly Exactly I think my my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children Uh-huh And I think that varies I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child you know it's it's once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's you know really really qualified per se with a with a baby definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency So uh-huh uh-huh Well I my experience I baby-sat a lot also at when I grew up and coming from you know that background and the background as a parent now I think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a a lot of times baby-sitters I know I did this with my children it's you get somebody where you kind of know the family already And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions Becaus- because I had three younger brothers and sisters myself so they they thought okay she knows how to how to treat children Uh-huh uh-huh Wow I agree with you but there again she you know she knew knew of your family and she and she met in a safe setting such as church So she was going on those two instincts Just the same I know myself I never and I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children And and in i- it really shocked me because just about six months ago someone came to my front door rang the doorbell She had just moved in the neighborhood She had her daughter with her and the daughter was about a second grader And she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit her child And I thought well she doesn't know me or my children from anything And it was I was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because I didn't know her then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house So I mean people are so different Well I did I did have my my child in a day care for just a short time a- when my oldest was about two and a half and I worked just a part-time job and in in those situations what I did is I'd I went in and you know I made a few phone calls I went in and visited I asked questions such as how they would discipline a child that was a concern with me you know c- you you learn a lot by going in there and they e- they explain to you you know what their day consists of and what their general rules are and that's you know that's as much as I know You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers you know that have done this over and over again But I go ahead I think lots of people I I think I went by location for one thing I think most people do that I think you start out with the criteria of you know do I know of anything or do I know anyone who has their child in a day care and Right Right And then you know I mean even at that you have to consider the logistics of it You know I mean you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north Yo- even if that's the best one in the whole wide world So there there are just so many considerations money is always a factor in my life definitely I've never you know I've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor even in something as important as day care I know if I didn't have that stipulation I would have done things differently you know Montessori school would be something that I would have pursued but that's always a little bit more expensive than what I could look at and I was very very fortunate in that I didn't have to do that on a full-time basis So and and then when you get you know when you get into the full-time basis day care
