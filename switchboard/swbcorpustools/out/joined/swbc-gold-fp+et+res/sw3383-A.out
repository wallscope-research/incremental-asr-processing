Seem to have the topic already on top of th- tip of your tongue there so why don't you go ahead and start Yes sir Okay Right exactly I sure do I in fact the last thing I have I've done I I don't even remember what it is I've had to have oil changes done myself because I live in an apartment complex where we are not allowed to work on our vehicle We can't even wash our vehicle so but the last thing I can remember doing wh- I had a sixty-six Mustang and that was all right because like you said that was pre technology days I guess And you know you could do a lot of it yourself still and I didn't tinker too much with the engine It was it was in pretty good shape but my main concern and what I enjoy doing was was the interior And it was it was pretty shelled but it was fun It was taking the whole thing you know the whole interior apart and you know ordering new carpeting and Right And It it was I my wife enjoyed she you know helped out a little We sanded down the the insides of the door panels And painted those and No I sold it Yeah it was fun though It was fun I I really enjoyed it and I was surprised at at the availability of parts yet You know you can you can still get factory original parts But you pay a premium but you just don't get them I I didn't I went ahead and got you know Japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made Canada You know prefabs and all that stuff but Well actually there was And I had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate certain patterns exactly And so like the the glove box was just a little little wider little harder to fit in and the carpeting stretched a little too far I had to cut some of the sides down But just just little things You know one of the screws on on the door regulat- window regulators you could get three of the three of the four to lineup The fourth one you couldn't get to lineup no matter what you did You know thin- it was but the end result is after you put your your panels on nobody sees that you got one screw missing in your your window regulator anyway and it it runs It works just the same so Disc brakes don't seem to give me too much problem but I I honestly don't have the tools for the drum I know you got certain spring lever that you got to have or some some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch my dad has got all that and and I I helped him when I was growing up but I don't have that stuff now because of the drum brakes I you know don't have any choice but to take them in Sure Uh-huh I'll tell you what The other the nicest thing about them is everything was standard You didn't have to worry about finding a metric anything Boy I tell you
