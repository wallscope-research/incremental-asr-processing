Well I I do about the same I guess but in a different fashion I I I'm from New York originally and now that I live in Florida I live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the in the summertime and I I feel that the the only legitimate paper although it might sound a little elitist is the NEW YORK TIMES I've always read the NEW YORK TIMES when I was younger and I try t- now that it has a national edition I read that I also read I I I guess I do watch MCNEIL LEHRER on P B S because I I lean to that coverage and and I guess I'm Yeah Well there it's a whole hour show Actually it's an hour show each evening and and we we turn it on when we start dinner We seem to start dinner around six and finish it up I find that I'm leaning on I travel a great deal even overseas and I find that I lean on C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff And I'm I I'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out I mean I I don't believe everything they say but it's it's coverage you know Yeah Yeah  Well yeah I I I Peter Arnet was reporting direct from Iraq I think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him I I think that what he he reported what he saw and if you didn't like it that was just too bad you know Yeah yeah I mean No That that's right I think so And and I guess when it comes to to magazines I don't read I used to when I was younger I subscribed to TIME and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT I I have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper or I I I also subscribe to something called WORLD PRESS which is a magazine that only talks about other ex- excerpts from the WORLD PRESS which sort of gives you a different slant than it's not as slanted as the NEW YORK TIMES or as biased perhaps as the local paper But that I guess and the radio I listen to P B S radio a lot and I also listen to these twenty-four hour news stations when I'm driving I Yeah Do you read are you from Southern or Northern California So well Yeah is that what is that the San Francisco paper out there is the major paper Yeah and that's a terrible paper Is that pretty good the what is that the CHRONICLE isn't it Oh yeah they ju- they really are probably the worse papers I've ever read I Yeah Well can you get the L A paper up there That's a pretty decent paper isn't it or Yeah Yeah Yeah Well that's another one I read I forgot that I read the WALL STREET JOURNAL not as in depth as I used to because they their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer but Yeah I I think I I agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff I feel pretty well versed in in what I'm doing because I I do spend more time on that than I do say on sports or although I watch that I spend a lot of time reading about these things I'm quite interested I find it very exciting to for the coverage we have now today If anything they I think they list- Well I don't know I I hear a lot of criticism about listening to these the Dan Rathers of the world and and listen- and taking their word for it or their comment actually they I think they slant things but No kidding wow I didn't know that Yeah Yeah Yeah was was he Yeah How do you feel about it I guess I I got to say if that's the subject if the subject is do I feel that we're well enough equipped to I don't know if if it said that I feel I'm well enough equipped Yeah To Yeah Yeah I think I do too I think you have to let yo- you got to segregate some of it Well that's about all I have to say Nice talking to you Bye-bye
