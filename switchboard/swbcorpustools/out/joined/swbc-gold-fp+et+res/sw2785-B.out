Well I don't do anything with the lawn really but I do gardening both flowers and vegetable gardening I we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden and that's fun well actually Wally's had one even when we haven't had big yard because we enjoy that We love fresh vegetables in the summer and it's just one of the things I enjoy doing So would I Yes I do so I manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward I work for a school system so I'm able to do that because I get home a little earlier and I can still do some some sorts of things but absolutely Wow that's wonderful But that that's and you really feel you can accomplish something and to help other people too that's neat Uh-huh Right That's wonderful Yeah Yeah well I think it sounds good I've never belonged to a garden club because I've always been more interested in just doing what I can do on my own I've never had the time really to get involved in the organized sort of format but I know people who do it and and enjoy it very much Oh My word For heaven's sake Well there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that I know of they're they're women But and usually they're the tea type things you know where they have a little luncheon and they do their thing But flowers are primarily the emphasis whereas I enjoy vegetable gardening almost more I do flowers sort of look pretty but I I really like to do the vegetables Being what my Well what a wonderful thing Yes terrible yeah Okay Well the flowers I'm just in fact I was going to go out today to buy some plants so I could put them in I I always have geraniums and and then I have a shady area that I need to be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun so I've discovered that impatiens that tried and true is turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus Because they look pretty and in my front garden but I like the vinca which is something I hadn't they look sort of like impatiens you know but they're not quite and they're better for the sun areas and of course you know the mine are old theory ordinary flowers marigolds and and that sort of thing In my No I don't I don't know maybe this climate is a little better but in the vegetable garden we grow usually what our favorite is something called white half runner green beans now that's Well you know why because I grew up in North Carolina and that was my mother's favorite bean she alw- she always grows you know five different varieties but that's the kind that produces the best And and they're wonderful and I pick them when they're very young and have very little string and then just steam them a little bit my mother picks them when they're fat and she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs and they're good both ways Yeah yeah in between the size wise yeah yeah Well my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them of course Yeah it is They're two different vegetables that way uh-huh my gosh My does mot- mother will be th- ninety this year and she lives in western North Carolina and she would do that if if we didn't tell her that she'd better not But she doesn't have that big a garden but she has a bigger one than I do And I have four children you know so yes yes it is it's great It's it's really her joy and I suppose that's why I enjoy gardening because you know growing up with it We also grow yellow and green squash much to my children's chagrin and we grow a lot of tomatoes there's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes So we enjoy that we grow I I have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family but I actually was successful for the last two years so I'm going to do it again That's right And we grow broccoli And I have been very happy about the new way of controlling the the worm that gets in broccoli by using the Bacillus Thuringiansis which is the little well in fact that's what they use for gypsy moth I don't know if you have had that problem there or not But it's you know it's a problem that's that's moving south from from the New England area And they devastate the trees so they they spray the government sprays t- two three times in the spring when the caterpillars are are coming along because what they do this this bacillus the worms ingest it and it expands in their in their digestive tract and they die So that's the same technique that is you know for any of the other little varmints that get in vegetables so it that's really very nice because it's a non toxic way of of handling the problem Well it's nice hearing you talk and I'm I wish you good luck have you just recently moved to Charlotte so well that's not very long Yes that's great that's great Well I hope you have a an opportunity to garden again well good Bye-bye
