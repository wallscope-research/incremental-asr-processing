Okay So tell me about CHINA CRY Uh-huh I see Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh     Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh Interesting story I I don't even remember seeing that advertised and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly That recent I see what you mean Uh-huh Well I guess what I what I saw most recently and luckily I saw it only a week ago so I'd remember remember it well was sort of light by comparison my husband and I had this great desire to go see a comedy and and we ended up going to see GREEN CARD GREEN CARD And he chose it and it's got this wonderful French actor who's it was his like his and he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years but he's never made an American film This was his American film debut and he speaks very broken English And basically he played a Frenchman who married an American girl in a marriage of convenience so that he could get his green card which is what an alien needs to work in this country And because she could claim she was married she could get an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in New York that had a garden an an an outside garden which is very unusual there So she was a horticulturist and that was sort of her dream Of course you know they got married and they never saw each other again Except except fate through them together through> threw and the Immigration and national- Naturalization Service started investigating So they had to get back together and get their stories straight and and she was a very svelte sophisticated urban New Yorker and he was a a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was He'd been working in a restaurant when they met And they had to learn all about each other basically in a in a weekend And it was you knew what was going to happen of course That they would fall in love Well they fell into like at any rate and and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever they did perfectly and then he said something because his English was so poor on for the most part he he was so proud of himself for giving ex- all the correct answers that that on the last one he said I never remember that answer and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers So
