Well what what kind of car did you just buy a car or are you in the market to buy a car or Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I I seem to remember when I was young that was a problem No Seems that all of B17 is one utterance The "no's" are not negative answers but the start and restart of utt 3  no car was big enough for that Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah yeah Uh-huh Which is the one that has modular type seats You know which one I'm talking about They have the commercial on TV where you can you can pull some seats out and you can move around Is that is that the Dodge Caravan that does that or Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Well the one that I can't remember one it is if it's the it it's the Toyota or or one of the other ones I don't know if it's one of the Americans or the import ones where they actually have like some bucket seats in the back but you can actually pull them out I mean they're really easy to pull out and you can move them around and stuff and it it to me that that would be real good for us my husband and I like to go camping and stuff and right now we have a van which is it's an older van and we're we're thinking about buying another sedan probably next year right now motorcycles takes precedence since that that's what my husband really wants right now But next year we'll probably buy a new car and we're looking at possibly the Honda Accord that's kind of as far as far as the interior it's got the luxury interior but d- it doesn't really have the luxury price tag that a lot of the other cars have which is one of the things that we were looking at You know finding something that's that's fairly affordable but yet has all the nice luxury items that we want Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well I think it's going to be a lot easier now I just heard that they lowered the prime lending rate so I think it's going to be a lot easier to to be able to get a car now and finance it I think banks are going to be a lot more a little bit more lenient Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I can imagine You got to kind of work work that into your budget Balance that and the house payment and of course is if you buy a new car you're going to are any of your kids driving age yet Are s- are they twins wow Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well the the Honda's have been have been very safe In in accidents more so that a lot of the American cars Matter of fact I just heard something today on on the news about those automatic seat belts that are attached to the door they're questioning the safety of those now saying that and they showed a simulation where there w- they had a dummy in the car and the door opened and the dummy actually fell out of the car and the car rolled out on top of him So they're saying they're not as safe as they give the appearance of being safe but they're really not as safe as they as they appear to be So I'm kind of concerned about that as far as you know w- the seat belts I don't know if Maryland has a a seat belt law/ but they do have one in Texas And you're you're required to wear them Exactly But ninety probably about well I don't know about ninety but probably fifty percent of the people that have those probably don't wear the lap portion of it I know my brother doesn't and he has one in his car So I mean it it kind of gives you a false sense of security You think I've got one portion of my seat belt on but if your door comes open you know it's not going to do you any good So that that that's a concern of mine as far as what I'll be looking at with buying a new car I'm not really sure if I would want the seat belts attached to the door I think I would feel better with them attached to the actual car The inside where they're normally attached to like behind the door Uh-huh  Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah the the Le Mans is like that too we used to have a Le Mans when I was in in high school and it was a big car I mean it was like the the Grand Prix and in I think around nineteen eighty they changed the model and it like went to half the size Literally I mean it got chopped in half and it wasn't even the same car anymore Didn't even remotely resemble the old car Yeah Well everybody that I've talked to who's ever had a Honda loves them And my husband had a Honda and it was a lease car and he had to turn back in a year and a half ago and he had it for four years and never had a single problem with it And it was great and the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because we didn't feel the at the time the residual was like sixty-five hundred dollars and it was a four year old car with seventy thousand miles on it and we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for a four year old car So so we ended up just went just went ahead and just turned the keys back in and and got out of the lease <> one thing that I that I am curious about is reading information on air bags do some of the vans I think I don't know about the Dodge Caravan but some of the vans now have driver side air bags Which I think is a good idea
