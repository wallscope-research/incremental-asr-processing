you know we even lived there for a a while when my husband was in the Navy In fact the first year we were married he was already over there had been there two years when we got married and so our we had a one year honeymoon it was very nice Uh-huh Uh-huh I'm sure Roberto died while we were down there as a matter of fact Yeah It's like anywhere else People are individuals and I find it really difficult an and frustrated trying to make stereotypes you know And i- I can understand the the frustration you must have gone through going to the the school No no it's just if if it's not part of your culture and you come upon something that you're totally unprepared for the firs- I had gone to a very <> conservative college and when I started teaching school it was in an inner city situation although it was not Puerto Rican it was a Mexican American and black students They weren't like any of the Mexican American or black people I had gone to school with so it was it was very very different Yeah really  my Yeah I'm not so much against their making it a state But I would want a very very very clear majority because if the minority can be so vociferous whether you're talking this group or or any other group that that has a stake in something And they can make as you said so well the a a few can make it so miserable for everybody else That that my give you a clue Uh-huh Yeah right needs slash unit I'm sure Same as as any other part of the world really I I don't I don't think it's really to their best interests to attain statehood as it is right now they have the best of both worlds They have representation but they don't have to pay all the taxes and so forth that we do being that it's an island economy everything is imported and yes the cost of living is super high but but they're protected in so many ways without having to to pay for the rights and privileges So so you know I I would just as soon an an and if if they voted to for independence I would back them a hundred percent And that's that's because I I guess because I'm not into territorialism or whatever that we have been in the past Right Yeah yeah yes uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Part of that though has been I think selected by by them in that that whereas they want the benefits of some of of what the continentals can offer they they want to maintain that culture of theirs which which I understand And and so often when you when you bring in the advantages the resources and so forth there there is a trade Most of the people who that i- that I know about who really would fa- favor statehood have pretty much assimilated into the the continental states already Or they have family here and this way they can go back and forth and and it's not that much of a strain and you know they're kind of lackadaisical about it At least at the present time That's the way the way the pendulum seems to be swinging right now No we really didn't keep that up it's just  Uh-huh Uh-huh  And so th- Yeah There really were three major camps and there were those who who were very friendly very open any anything we can do for you either way you know was great And then there were those at the other end of the spectrum and those that ho hum whatever you know and and it it was interesting the whole time we were there it was very very political There was always some on Sunday afternoons going through the all the little urbanizations the little neighborhoods with blow horns I can't think of the term but you know And with banners and and a parade of vehicles with their with their colors of the of a particular party So they were very very passionate about their beliefs but it it it kind of broke down that you couldn't really see I couldn't see that there was a clear majority that that stayed It seemed to shift as as I see okay Well I have enjoyed it Uh-huh Bye-bye
