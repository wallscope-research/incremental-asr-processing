Laurie Okay I'm supposed to ask you how do you make use of your credit cards and I'm supposed to compare those with my my habits Yes Right No I do not Uh-huh okay Sure Well myself I always tr- I'm I'm a traveling person and I'm out of town quite a bit so I use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in my car to my lounging entertainment and for everything So that's as far as using them outside that I'm not I don't use them too much but I I think my wife is sort of like you she uses a credit card most of the time So she does most of the shopping for our household so she'll use them more than I will Yes So it's me I'm always I'm the guy that always goes to like Dillard's and I'll go in and charge something and I'll have to give them my driver's license They'll have to look up the number because I'm never carrying a credit card But I do carry like my American Express and my Visa which I use for you know primarily work type things This is my first call by the way so is it really All right so we're both beginners then I've had this for a couple weeks and I've been out of town so this is my first time to to use it So No I was given this topic Yeah they give you they assign you a topic you call the eight hundred number Have you tried it yet Okay When you call the eight hundred number they assign you a topic and pretty cut and dried I'm not sure A couple about two minu- three minutes I think But I really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards I one thing I've always tried to do is when I get my credit cards I always try to pay them off because I just sort of detest paying interest And like years ago my wife and I got married she was the one with a little bit than I was because I had my credit cards I think up to the limit and I was giving everyone ten dollars a month and everything like that That was like thirty years ago so now it's a little different We I get a bill and I'll pay it the same day it comes in Or at least I try to and I just kind of tell my kids how much I hate paying interest so they should follow the same rule you bet it's ju- it's an absolute savings You bet That's that's very handy Well I think that's all I have Nice to meet you and give it a try I think you'll enjoy it Okay Thank you Bye
