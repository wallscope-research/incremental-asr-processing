Hey Steve They just they just started a recycling program here I think Actually this is my first experience with recycling program but instead of just like tossing everything away which I always felt bad about I am starting to split stu- split stuff up The only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb They make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there What are they doing up there The the deposits only on like drink stuff Okay Okay okay So did they you're giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group and the handicapped group is getting the the money or or are you or are they some home distributing the funds back to you Okay That's very cool You know there's a I heard about a similar program in New York City where a thing called like Homeless Incorporated or something like that but what they do is employ homeless I think mostly men but homeless people to go out and collect all the recyclable cans and and I think it's mostly cans There may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not and they bring them up to a one lo- one centralized location and are able to collect the money from the various beer and and soda manufacturers and and get more money to these people that desperately need it Yeah Do they do it with news papers as well
