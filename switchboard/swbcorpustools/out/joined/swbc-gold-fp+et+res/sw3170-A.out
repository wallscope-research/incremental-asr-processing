Basically my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases We really don't get into small little purchases If we're going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card but other than that it's not something that we use a lot of we may have only two or three versus I know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or up to a dozen credit cards but ours are just major credit cards that we have and use use only when when we feel it's necessary to make a big purchase Yeah Yeah yeah one Sears Sears is pretty major with us simply because we do Appliances and things like that and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that so But we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate If you've got the cash to pay for something it's better to do it that way than versus credit cards unless it's a small enough sum that you can do it within a two three month period but if it's any large purchases you've got to kind of think about how much you're going to put down as far as payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off so Uh-huh Yeah Yeah yeah Uh-huh Sure sure Uh-huh Sure so you know Sure Yeah Exactly Exactly Or if it's a business transaction a lot of times that's important too to keep a better receipt of it So yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure sure For the month or whatever Yeah Exactly So Uh-huh yeah Exactly sure Sure yeah yeah and you always get these preapproved credit card things coming through your credit is great so let's send you another credit card or it's preapproved for That's that's to entice you to get more credit cards Yeah And so you know we always laugh about that because it's quite a bit I mean you know you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff so ours is through a bank yeah should they 'yeah' be a seperate slash unit/ We had it a long time ago through a bank and it just a but you're already paying them if you're if you don't pay it off within that month interest anyway so yeah that's exactly it so Okay Okay All right thanks a lot Bye now
