Oh boy probably robberies people stealing from each other Is that what happens up there a lot th- that that's mostly what I hear though is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen That's the most prevalent crime the ones that really you know the ones that really add up after a while I guess you know from s- far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs You know everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually well yeah that that that is a crime I guess when you when you count all the little things that people do like speeding is a crime I break that law every day Uh-huh Well I've I've been caught with marijuana before so I guess that was a crime I got a year's probation for that but No it wasn't that big a deal when I think of crime I think of stuff that that affects other people like people getting you know killed or raped I think rape is one of the worst crimes Yeah it's very degrading and Yeah Yeah right once once a person's you know gone then it's but the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life you know Well for for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders I think the death penalty is it's a pretty good thing They they have that down here in Florida still They the electric chair and do they Yeah I think I think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy and I guess usually they're they're always sure they got the right guy but Yeah so do I Yeah i- if that You know the sooner a a a year's plenty of time you know for something to come out I guess Then you know there's been guys in jail for six years and the other guy admits that he did it and they it's like oops But Uh-huh Right yeah I don't know if it would or not though I I don't think it's a so much of a deterrent as as it is a a good a good way for vengeance you know for the relatives and and family members you know what I mean Yeah Yeah it kind of gets it off their chest Yeah I know that a a lot of the lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other And they're the kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that I don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead but I y- y- you might be able to stop people you know they're thinking about it they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught Right Yeah That's right Yeah Yeah they could p- probably do it again That's right they didn't have any time doing it the first time No it do-
