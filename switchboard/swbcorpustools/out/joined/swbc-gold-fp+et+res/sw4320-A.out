Okay Well needless to say here in Washington D C this is the war zone D C around here stands for drug capital or death capital It's it's really bad here for example the local high school they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns and they're starting to get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things So Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh right That's how they they bind themselves together in groups I guess and Now the interestingly enough I don't think we have here a a lot of gangs but only a couple of not a whole large group of them but just a few Most of them centered around drug territory And so they're protecting their economic interests I guess And nowadays the latest thing I've I've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up and then as you get out of the car they just step up and take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house Yeah that's the latest thing That way there's no damage to the car or anything They just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want Uh-huh Right Just wait for you to drive to your house you get out and they get in off they go with your car So it's I think they call it car jacking around here Uh-huh yeah that's kind of the latest thing but every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides so it's it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here we're from I'm from Ohio and my wife's from Florida so And we've just come from twenty years in the military and which is an entirely different environment so this is a whole new thing for for us to to have to put up with and it's really scary sometimes Right And it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school and of course the mayor of D C is having a real problem trying to what do you do to to reduce crime in a in a major city like D C where it's a way of life for everybody It's I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem I don't know what what the solution is there's no way they can stop the drugs and that's what's causing all the killing <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right And they see all their friends and neighbors Yeah and their friends are driving Mercedes and so it's actually they grow up with that as their way of life and I think to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised Right exactly so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes and they they say well it's it's the law that's got to be changed instead of their way of life so I don't know it's I'm glad it's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it's not easy Uh-huh Right They've always been with us Uh-huh Uh-huh Right
