Okay I guess tonight's subject is woodworking Do you Well k- kind of mainly the woodworking I've done lately is made like for example a little nativity scene not the the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable put some shelves in and and some odd stuff around the house and so I I enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking and I do it out of hobby more than you know something I have to do How about yourself Uh-huh Well I'll have to come and see them That sounds like a good idea I you know and that's that is right it is out of necessity because lot of the things that well we can't be able to afford but also I I sometimes think that I enjoy doing that and I like to get out and and to work with my hands and sounds like you got some real nice tools too Do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools Uh-huh Uh-huh a entertainment type center Oh Right Right right Right or yes I yeah I'm aware of that And also with a router you can make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge And And casings and so forth that are that are real nice so that's that's good That's good Yeah  Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldn't be able to do that but yeah a table saw does take a lot of time excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment And Uh-huh Uh-huh No they don't have basements Well I'm from up north also and and no there's no t- basements down here and it's kind of hard to get shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that Yeah lot of the equipment too that I've I've used in the past I w- you know I've used in school and I would I don't know I'd I'd kind of like to to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say a table saw and some of those things that would make some pretty nice pieces of well wood for for different things for tables for for chairs for you know decks and so forth so I don't know I I just enjoy woodworking and I think the the main thing is like you say it's a it's a good out It's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day and it's a great stress stress reliever Yes I have in school I have and I've made different things la- tables for chairs and I've made bowls and and
