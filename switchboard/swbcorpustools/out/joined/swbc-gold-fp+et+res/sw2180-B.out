Okay have you ever been involved in any trials Wow Sounds like it it sounds like it I haven't had any actual real life experience but my father-in-law's been involved in several trials including a couple murders And you know talking to other people who have been there and so I don't have any real experience with trials but I do you know I I've I took a little business law in in college and and I've you know try to keep abreast of things But m- I think that the trial by jury is is a great idea at it's inception back two hundred years ago right now though it's it's so difficult because there's so few courts to to get anything really done as you know you spent you know a whole summer on one trial and it's just that I think they're just tieing up the whole judicial process typo> tying there's a lot of things they could do to make things easier and you know like the suggestion that maybe be a judge should be the one who decides on what the sentence should be rather than the jury Uh-huh Uh-huh Jeez Uh-huh Uh-huh Gee Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yes yes I agree would surprise me that when I was in Texas I had the displeasure of getting a traffic ticket And I went to court and you can even get a trial by jury for a traffic ticket No And I thought my God talk about tieing up things for for typo> tying Yes I mean that's extremely expensive I mean the first thing you had to do when you came before the judge was waive your right to a jury trial I'm like God this is ridiculous Uh-huh my God Yes I I think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that you know people would get a fair trial and not have to go through this process I mean some things are just so cut and dry in the in you know the the level of evidence that they come up with now I mean you know when you start thinking about well they've got video tape and and audio tapes and they've they've got you know they've got ways to nail people to the point where they they really shouldn't even be going to trial Yes that was horrible That it Yeah Yes I know I mean I only heard portions of that but it's absolutely terrible And you know if you beat a dog like that they'll put you in jail you know Jeez Huh Yes I I believe that too Well it's been nice talking with you Okay thank you you do the same Bye-bye
