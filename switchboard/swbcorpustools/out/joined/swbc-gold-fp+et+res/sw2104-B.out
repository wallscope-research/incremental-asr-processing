Okay I don't really I more I don't know about the government as much as the people I wouldn't consider to be a threat at all and I really don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore I'm I'm worried about them They're in a very tumultuous state right now with the kinds of adaptations that they're attempting to go through Yeah Yeah I think that's that's a real important aspect and that as the the mo- the most the mo- let's see the more that we do that we do or that we can do to help them become self-sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming you know a reality I know that this last winter was very hard on several areas in the in the the Ukraine particularly the coal mining regions of Siberia the people there have money that's not their problem but there's no food for them to buy and its you can't eat money Yeah Right they've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they've been through now and they've been they've been under under the oppression that they've been under for so long that now they have some freedoms but they don't know how to act yet They don't understand that to make that work they've got to take some responsibility for themselves It's not just the government's responsibility anymore You can't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well Okay All right bye-bye
