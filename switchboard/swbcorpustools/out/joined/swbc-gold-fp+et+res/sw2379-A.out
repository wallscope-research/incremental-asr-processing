So tell me about changes from say twenty years ago since you were an adult twenty years ago Well you're you're able to you're able to vote and go to war and things like that/ so that's right that's one of the changes Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh Uh-huh uh-huh And is the company now well represented demographically at the higher echelons Did it work Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh So there's less you think now there's less of a a social movement and more individual mov- lots of individual movements In a sense The me decade Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Well that I've been aware of I've at least in my own circles I've been aware of an increasing from my generation I don't know if I can quite call myself a distinct generation from you but half generation off I guess I've noticed a certain increase pessimism with America no longer being sort of on top I had the impression well I mean there was the quote unquote losing of the Vietnam war which was a blow and it was right around that time when I started becoming socially you know a socially conscious adult And I realize that people of my age have no no major success in the sense that you saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and major social change in that sense and I and all the changes that have happened in the last even during my adulthood have been more incremental They've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made but there hasn't been the same sort of fiery speeches of Martin Luther King or whatever that has really galvanized the population And there's just instead there's been sort of an increasing I don't know Japan bashing and things like that And a lot of I see among some of my friends and even more among some of my students who are you know maybe twenty a real sense of you know America's losing it And losing it in the competitive market and a real knowl- a lack of understanding how that could be In the sense that how could America have gone from being number one to possibly being number two to you know our former enemies and things like that and so I see I see a lot of a lot of pessimism growing and at the same time I think there's there's there's a growing environmentalist movement and sense of corporate respon- increased corporate responsible towards you know environmental safety and things like that And that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the Civil Rights Act in in the near future in terms of you know some real landmark bills passing and things like that Such that you know people The thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now I mean my generation doesn't can't rest on the the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that you know yes there's still some racism but you know basically things are the assumption things are basically kind of taken care of and there's a notion of fairness That's while still far from perfect is much more established I think Uh-huh of course It's human nature Yeah yeah Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh Yeah yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Right And that's a real change except it sort of brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else I mean all this recycling used to be in tact typo in tact should be 'intact' or not all of it but much of it did I mean recycling was a was a wartime thing Yes Yes Uh-huh A perceived decline anyway yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well I'd I'd say actually I mean as someone who's involved in education I'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society I mean relative pay which is a major way we value people has been poorer and poorer over the years you know that there's been cost of living increases but not quite in proportion to cost of living/ and you know it's just more and more a real low income sort of job and very low prestige I mean there's that that old saying those who can do it and those who can't teach this is the way of let's make fun of the teachers those are the people who can't do anything And if you have that kind of social attitude it's hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education And you get more and more people and up there because it's it's the safety net of those of you know average intelligence or something they can always teach Uh-huh Uh-huh
