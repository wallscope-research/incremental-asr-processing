Uh-huh that sounds good we're not real wealthy at the moment Last time I had people over for dinner we had lasagna and I used my mother's recipe I really like it It's got you cook the noodles and make and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it and I'm not sure she even puts must be some Italian spices in there I can't remember But for the cheese part you mix sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese and layer all that It's good And then tossed salad and and <> my goodness Diane get down from there <> And let's see what else did I serve with that Corn yeah I made French bread with that one too I have a recipe that's pretty good for that So Yeah I've heard that Sam's has a really good lasagna in fact I think I had it at a at a party once It was good Easy Yeah Yeah I know yeah Not my favorite place but A necessity Let's see what else do we like to have for trying to think what else I like to serve My mother likes to serve taco grandes Have you ever had that You take a flour tortilla and you fry it like a taco shell and you for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some tomato sauce in it and and I like to just add picante sauce to get the Mexican flavor so you don't have to mess with spices and stuff And then let's see and then and you heat up refried beans and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese and what you do to make it you take the shell and you spread the beans on first then you put the meat then you put the grated cheese and then you put let's see what's next then and I I usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the lettuce and you can put like guacamole and <> Katy I'm on the phone Well get a towel or go change I'm on the phone <> a little sour cream is good and and chopped olives yeah No I don't very often Usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain so Yeah I just cut slices off and I like an avocado sandwich too Yeah yeah <> What you want <> wh- where do they get it I can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to I guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe Yeah It helps if you I helps if you leave the pit in it Yeah if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing especially while you're waiting before you serve it That's supposed to help keep the keep it from turning brown so quick Oh that's good That probably helps too <> Do you want it yeah we have too <> Do you want scrambled Yeah Yeah if you get it on sale Yeah yeah I don't think mine know either In fact we've been getting lunch meat that's turkey too It costs less than the other I don't know there's supposed to be something more healthy about it Poultry instead of the beef and pork yeah Yeah I I can't think of any other specific things I like to serve One salad that we always like my sister-in-law always brings to family dinners is a I don't know what you call it you mix cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of like Cool Whip that's good and quick and easy Uh-huh
