Well I the biggest way it's going right now  lot + } most of the grocery stores have got things set up s- where you can bring in your plastic and your cans and newspapers And then they've just got different barrels setting out I shouldn't say barrels like big John Doors or whatever they're called Gondolas they've got them set outside and  Yes It's all voluntary Now they do have some places where you can take things and get cash but I think the lot of people don't really want the cash You know they just want to help recycle Which is what we do You know we probably the only thing sometimes we'll take cash or the cans in and we let the kids get the money for that But f- Right Right Yeah That's true but but that's really the the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating You know but Uh-huh really wow Yeah So it's vol- you say it is all voluntary Do they Will it be mandatory Is it all is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff or is it all Okay Yeah And that's Right Right Yeah That's true That's Well they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers and stuff like that But you know I think a lot of people like I said are more concerned with you know right now you know the aspects of saving the earth Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Well I tell you it's kind of funny now at e- even at T I I don't do you work for T I Okay at T I they're doing recycling I mean for a long time they didn't do this but now they're they're recycling cans and paper We have separate bins separate wastebaskets in our offices for paper You know and they I mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees and you know it's really I can't believe that you know Because they've got it all posted all over the place how much they're saving and how w- yeah okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Right Yep So you don't think about it Right I know Yep Yeah Well you think about the waste even I mean you know cost wise and and you know like you s- saving trees and stuff like that I mean it's just amazing you know the difference N- I haven't seen anything but that doesn't mean that they don't I don't watch much T V but I haven't really seen anything advertise publicly And then like I said they do a lot of internal advertising on that kind of stuff But I haven't seen anything But see I don't see a lot of T I advertisements on T V anyway I think they advertise more other places where they're not located You know So So I don't see a lot of advertisements for T I Right Uh-huh Right Right Well even I mean in the kid's schools I mean they do things to try and recycle And I know my kids like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say look at that Somebody is not saving the earth you know So I mean the kids I mean they really try to educate all ages you know and it's good to start the kids real young on stuff like that Because I mean when I was a kid they never did stuff like that I mean it's like nobody was concerned about it You know and it's like You know it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things saying Hey you know we're ruining the earth you know And now everybody is doing something about which is good But how come we weren't doing this say twenty years ago you know Uh-huh Uh-huh Well Yeah This is Right Yeah That's true I think that it it really surprises me because of the cost savings I mean this is such a tremendous amount of cost savings I mean why I can't understand why nobody saw that before I mean even even not even the aspects of not saving the earth I mean it's so cost you know Bro- yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Oh I see okay Is not real cost efficient okay okay I understand that though Uh-huh Right and glass Right Uh-huh Yeah That's true And even I I noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil And I mean that kind of surprises me I mean you know because once oil gets so you know thick and yucky you'd wonder how they could you know clean that up enough to use it again but they can I don't know how cost efficient that would be I guess Uh-huh Uh-huh Wow Yeah Yeah I know Really I know I really I don't know I I think that I mean I think that they really are doing a good thing now and I hope it keeps well I'm sure we'll keep up You know I think it's really catching on You know I I think that I'm not sure if it I don't know I think it's a good idea to make it mandatory it because like we were asking some people that live in North Dakota Well are you saving your you know are you recycling And they said Well we're not forced to do it yet so no You know so I mean I don't know/ I think that if people are forced if the people are not forced to do it they may not you know I mean I don't know I think a lot of people still will but Right
