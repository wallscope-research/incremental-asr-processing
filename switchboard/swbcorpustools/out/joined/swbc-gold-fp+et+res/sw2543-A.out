Okay what kind of music do you like Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I listen I listen to a wide variety of music Sometimes I'll turn on the classical music <> sometimes I'll listen to jazz every now and then country and western I'll listen to some of the rock stations I also like the the the classic rock stations that play the older more mellow type rock music <> some of the some of the rock stations now are the I guess the top forty stations or whatever They just it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials and sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating and it gets kind of old and they play the same songs over and over and I just get kind of tired of all that So lots of times I'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio actually But most of my cassettes I guess I don't I don't like hard rock I have some some rock and some jazz and a couple maybe one or two country and western Some I can't believe I can't think of his name Garth Brooks I have a couple of his tapes And but it's mainly it's mainly just the the light rock type stuff Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh No I don't I sure don't because I have so many albums and cassettes I feel like gosh I'm going to have to go out and buy a C D player and then start collecting C Ds and it just I haven't gotten around to doing it yet Yeah yeah Just like V C R's too Yeah I thought of that too that if I wait it'll get a lot less expensive and I can do without it for a while Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh That's and a C D is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was too right now I think They're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece Yeah Yeah I bought some at Christmas time for friends of mine that have C D players I thought my gosh now I know another reason why I'm not going to get a C D player for a while Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah see I've got a on my stereo I've got a a turntable and then I've got a dual cassette so I can record off other cassettes But I never realized you couldn't record onto C- I just never really thought about it because I haven't really looked into it very much I don't have one and and I've never really looked at one very closely but that that would be inconvenient because I have a cassette player in my car Now I guess you know one of these days when I get a new car maybe I guess all of them will probably have C Ds players by then but I'm not planning on doing that for a while I just got mine paid off I'm going to stick with the cassettes and and you know until until they now my sister my younger sister has a she does have a C D player that she got for Christmas and she's got the the cassette so she can record off cassettes onto C Ds I mean I'm sorry o- other way around off C Ds onto cassettes  so I can record some things from her and you know get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if I want to but but I just haven't gone to C D yet Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh yeah And they get worse and worse too Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that's amazing how I used to when I was in college I used to have the stereo on all the time or I had on M T V or something but ever since I've been out of college I guess over the last several years I listen to the stereo less and less Now I I will turn on I've got a small jam box in my bathroom I'll turn that on while I'm in the shower and while I'm getting ready because there's really not much else I can do and it's kind of boring standing there putting on makeup so I'll turn the radio on and and then I listen to it when I'm in the car driving to work because again there's you know there's nothing else going on I might as well listen to the radio while I'm driving to work But other than that I've I really don't I don't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore I guess I'm just too busy doing other things that it's too much trouble to get up and go decide what I want to listen to and put it on the on the turntable I don't know I just don't don't bother to do it very much anymore Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh That's good What instrument does he play Uh-huh Uh-huh I've never heard of that Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I'm sure it is I'm sure it is I was exposed to a lot of music when I was younger I my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years and so I was I was a real good piano player but then I got interested in a lot of other things and I got real involved in many things and and now I don't have a piano in my apartment or anything I could sit back down and play a few things but not like I used to be able to It's kind of sad that I've let that slip away And I took guitar lessons I think for one or two years and that was about the same time I was taking piano And then I got too busy in high school <> to really keep up with it between homework and
