Start th- well right now they've got a kind of a central location off of the main highway and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper plastic I think three bins for glass white green and whatev- whatever other combination there is And and I think they've got a comp- some kind of container for aluminum Uh-huh Yeah  Uh-huh  Well that's good Well Rowlett had sent sent out a survey not too long ago in terms in how many people were interested in having a a pick up I guess on the days they do trash or something like that And apparently a lot of people responded to it favorl- favorably because they're going to do it I don't know how how soon they're going to do it or how organized it's going to be but they're they're supposed to initiate that some- sometime in the next couple of months I've never noticed that We don't have a a whole lot because we're in a hospital setting so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria no There's there's only one pop machine and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now so mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea No Not not really Uh-huh  Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah That's good Yeah I I guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is And I think they're trying to to make some changes I I noticed at the library or someplace this past month month and a half ago they were having a speaker talk about doing lawn work and h- how important it is to to cut your lawn without a bag Just to kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of a- all the the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff and it's I guess a lot more e- ecological to just mow the grass and let it work it's way back into the soil I saw part of that Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah  Yeah well there are a lot of things that aren't I'm that's one of the things I wonder about one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else I I wonder about some of the prod- products that they don't take like some of the plastics and things that they don't take why why they couldn't do more recycling with those  Yeah True Yeah I noticed that about things like I s- I seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and and lawn additives and that type of thing but the cost is is like double or sometimes triple what the regular things you fertilizers and things you buy So in in terms of that it's you know and for the environment it's it's there's a good reason to do it but the cost is kind of prohibitive Uh-huh Yeah it's a good idea Uh-huh Yeah true  Yeah I I'd heard something stranger talk about bottles the other day on on the radio station I think it's K L T Y They were talking about the I think it's in Canada they're using recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs as a a reinforcement for roads For road repairs And apparently they they don't break down very easily and they don't expand or or contract when the weather changes and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing Uh-huh Huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well I think the the more people are aware of it the the more they'll do I think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that Uh-huh Yeah True Uh-huh
