Well preferred benefits I worked for a large corporation in the past and I think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because right now I'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there and there is a lot of profit that's coming in but when it comes to small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quick quickly or whatever or however you want to say it and the benefits aren't as great when I worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay we've got this amount of money let's put into this plan this plan you got Four Oh One K plans You have better vacation plans you have just in general maternity leave plans tha- that kind of thing Big corporations are able to do that versus small corporations you know they just don't have the money or just feel that there isn't the need for it So I've worked for both big and small so I've had a chance to kind of take a look at the pros and cons of both Sure Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh  Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh That's pretty good for you know being a a school district type program Uh-huh Wow That's extremely good slash error like the small corporation that I work for There's no pension plan there's no type of savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for There's really I think you're allowed so many times I think two or three days a w- a year It's not accumulative type of sick leave you know things like that So I've been looking at big corporations and saying the big corporation that I've worked for in the past had the pension plans had the big health health care you had your insurance and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a a very small place they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations And <> Uh-huh Sure No Yeah Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Sure sure Yeah yeah Uh-huh Is it a union Uh-huh that's pretty good Uh-huh Sure Yeah Uh-huh yeah Yeah I know what you mean and that's true I mean yo- i- it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position sure Yeah Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Well that's it you know and and I've kind of looked around at that too Because salary wise I don't think I'm making as much with a big corporation because I think when you look at big corps or large I'm talking like hugh companies like Three M I'm Honeywell Texas Instruments I know people that are that have vacation times and bene- benefits that I wouldn't even dream of in a small corporation You bring it up to the owner and it's like come on you know Partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer And and of course when it's a small corporation it also wants to expand so that money is spent
