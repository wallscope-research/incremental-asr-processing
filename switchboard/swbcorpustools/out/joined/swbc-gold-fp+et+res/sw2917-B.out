Oh Well my husband and I have gotten into some some problems with credit cards We don't handle them very well We we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more They they're they're really bad for us matter of fact we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa and we pretty much keep those maxed out Yeah we had cre- I had probably twenty credit cards for I had I had an American Express American Express Gold an Optima all the different department stores two Visas two MasterCards I mean I had any time anybody would you know send me an application you know preapproved or whatever I went I took it and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble because see the more credit cards you have the more people offer them to you And the more you use them the more they send them to you Exactly The American Express was probably the worst because with the Gold card I can't remember how much it was because I didn't even have it very long before I gave it up but I know the Green card was like thirty-five forty- five dollars a year Which was a lot because I mean you had to pay it in full every month Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah I had a Discover and that was one of the ones in the group that I ended up closing it really wasn't my choice though I mean I ended up having I ended up actually losing my credit cards I ended up going through a credit counseling service because my husband and I just don't handle credit very well and when when you do that they automatically once you start with their service they close your accounts out So I'm still paying on all these accounts but my accounts are closed So and I would prefer to keep it that way Once we once we're paid off I would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa and that's it I think that's a really good way to handle it because that way if you if you paid off every month you never have to worry about well how much do I have to pay these guys you know this month you know This you buy what you can afford I mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash it's a lot easier to keep it in check Yeah Uh-huh Yeah and I and I think at this at this point in time with the economy the way it is I think that it's going to get even worse I'm I'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off now you know we only we started this last year and we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole But I think this they way the whole economy is going right now it's just not good to be in debt Uh-huh Yeah Well when you when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle and if you really get into the mind set I got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul and it was scary because I was so good at it And I thought this is not right I mean this has got to stop because eventually it'd end up catching up at catching up with me and it hit me in the face  I + yeah I  have I've learned a lot from it I've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand and my husband's too because he's he's the same way I am I don't I don't think that well when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending until the bill comes in And then all of a sudden you look at the bill and you go my gosh I spent this much Yeah we pretty much use them for emergency type things like transmission fell out on our car and that paid for a new transmission and and things like that and we try not to use them for incidental type things like you know gas and stuff like that Yeah Yeah I've I've gotten I've gotten a lot more away from from credit cards and I pay by check a lot more now I I admire you for having having that mind set for  not + not even getting you know past the thirty days I would that's ideally the where where I would like to be Uh-huh I can imagine Yeah yeah Uh-huh Think about what you can buy for sixty dollars Yeah yeah I I think about all all the money that that we've spent on interest on all of our credit cards and it's just incredible We've never been able to take it off our income tax I'm I'm fairly newly married I've only been married less than two years and before that I never owned a home or anything so I never had any deductions So really it was always just money thrown away And I never really thought about it because Yeah I was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem Yeah Most most people don't like to talk about money They feel uncomfortable I think You know for a lot of people it is very personal Yeah But I think the the average American is probably pretty heavily in debt Not not including like a mortgage A mortgage is an understandable debt because that's you have you have to have a roof over your head And I would much rather own my own home than than be renting it like we're doing I mean we're basically you know kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away We're renting a house But you know right now with the way our credit card situation is there's nobody in the world that's going to give us a mortgage on a house Yeah Yeah It's it's going to it's going to take quite a while Hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home But I'm not really counting on it real soon
