Yeah Well I can understand that It's that time of the year We just my wife and I just recently moved into our house So we're spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things But like to keep up to date too I guess in the since I got out of college which was about five years ago my T V viewing started to tend more towards documentary news programs things like that Something that's going to keep mu up to date I've kind of kind of gotten away from being a series watcher having to keep up to date with Uh-huh Yeah that makes a big difference Okay I yeah I started too and kind of kind of worked away from that I I have a hard time sticking with something like like on T V because it like it gets real aggravating if you miss it for a week or two You feel kind of left out But right I believe that Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah That's right Yeah I know exactly how you feel That's right I when I first moved down here moved into the apartment and got cable and I guess I sort of kind of became numb Nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the T V you know And then all of a sudden I started paying paying attention to <> network T V again once in a while Right now we don't have cable And it's surprising how much it's changed the whole moral situation everything is just gone one whole complete direction different And we don't have any kids yet but I feel the same way It's really tough to find something that's going to be good and interesting for the kids Even even cartoons you know you watch some of the cartoons and kids aren't aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there It's none of it's probably damaging lot of times Right right yeah yeah That's right Well that's true Uh-huh I'm glad you said it and I didn't have to But that that that's the I feel the exact same way I sit I sit and watch some shows and I'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show You know why do you do this to yourself Yeah Okay Right Now there's an idea Okay yeah Yeah yeah That's pretty good I can't handle it very long I I mean I'm I'm a sports fan but it's well it's kind of it's kind of like reading magazines any more If half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials it probably wouldn't be so bad But it it's you're missing an awful lot I'd rather personally rather watch see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium but + But no I don't sit down I'll sit down for the big games the Super Bowl and the championship you know things like that But I don't follow any team I check the scores the next morning and I know how everybody's doing and that suffices me But I like I like good comedy good humor once in a while Well yeah Uh-huh Yeah it works you bet yeah Yeah no I don't know if there's any any series that I pay attention to I try to watch CHEERS once in a while Yeah it is In fact it's I think it's on tonight I just got in from outside so I so I'm kind of out of it Things like that and I consider that fairly intelligent humor You know You can tell they pick up the words every once in a while Yeah I try to Yeah Yeah you know it was it was just automatic too no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it I think it's come around again It's gone through cycles Uh-huh Yeah That's right That's right Right Yeah that's for sure that is for sure Well I guess there are a few things around still but Sounds like you pretty much agree Well Been good talking to you Okay You too Bye
