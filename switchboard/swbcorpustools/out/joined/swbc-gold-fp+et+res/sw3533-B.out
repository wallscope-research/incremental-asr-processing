Good Yes We have two children they're both grown and married and with we have our daughter has three sons so we see them at least once a week and we see our son and his wife about every other week and we baby-sit quite frequently So we're a fairly close-knit family We're together a lot on special days and and of course with the holidays and everything Uh-huh Oh yes Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh Pianos uh-huh Uh-huh you don't get to see any of yours very often Yes uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh most the time well right now it's football season and our daughter is a big Cowboy fan as is our husband so my husband so she watches that and I play with the grandchildren I enjoy the grandchildren But now like last weekend there's the Soviet space exhibit is here in Dallas and it ends in January so she and and the three boys and my husband and I went over into Fort Worth to see the space exhibit and this Sunday Uh-huh Yeah it's + slash error it's  been here for quite some time I think it came here in either September or October and it's very interesting very interesting and it's been very well done and this next Sunday they're coming over after the Cowboy game and we're going to go take the boys to see Christmas lights and go to a Santa's village And then when our son's over we have a pool and he and his wife come and a lot of their friends and we have cookouts on Sunday And we we do a lot with with our kids and we we always have We've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger we're very family oriented We we like being with our kids and the kids seem to enjoy being with us and their friends enjoy being with us So which that keeps us very very young with all these young people passing in and out and eating and seems like I've Well it does I'm worried about Christmas Christmas Eve they all pass through and then they all end up spending the night Christmas Eve night so that we open our presents on Christmas day and they go out to the other you know the in-laws in between some of this but they're all with us and then have Christmas dinner with us and then go to other in-laws and things so we see a lot of them But we enjoy Christmas Eve night because they all start arriving by about eleven o'clock and we open presents about five o'clock Christmas morning and you know and then I go to the kitchen and cook and my sister and and her husband are coming down so there's going to be eleven of us for Christmas Yeah Sometimes I'm a little exhausted I I think the trends are going back to spending more time with families I think parents are definitely spending more and more time I don't think they're leaving them with baby-sitters you know I think I think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was there for about I don't know eight or nine years Seems like it went through a spell there where families weren't that big a deal Parents kind of went and did their thing kids did their thing And slash error Yes uh-huh
