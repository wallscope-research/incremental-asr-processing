I think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country Now I think what we made a major wrong turn when we went into the to the current generation of space craft the reusable ones like they are now because they have not proven as reliable as they should have and I think some of the earlier approaches were much more much better in many ways However you know we've gained an awful lot from the space program all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to some new space age materials plastics and all that So I think it's been a good investment somebody was telling me the return was about twenty-five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent which is amazing for any governmental financed program I wish the post office would just stop raising our rates I think though that now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and the I don't know the guilt that we had out of Challenger I think maybe we can pick up and go on now But I I don't know I don't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives The space station's where we should go at this point Well where do you think we ought to go with it You talking about a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there Well Well I think about half the nations now are are military related are they not And It seems like it's that high a percentage Well it can't afford to No we were talking about that this weekend We it's only going to be there a couple of more weeks We need to go Have they yes Well maybe I need to run out there this weekend Now do you have to have tickets ahead Excuse me I think both of my kids are too old for that they're both Yes yes Did you It's very impressive I'm sure Uh-huh Well see that's something else The Russians have had space stations manned stat- space stations for years now You know they had the Merv and see we've yet to keep anyone up over over a week or ten days
