Well actually I think it's good I I I hope that we get a chance to promote peace out there because I think without peace we're not going to get stable oil prices and and I'd I'd really like to see stability in that area because I'm always afraid that's where another big war is going to start Not that Desert Storm was a small one I saw just recently where the U S is supposedly going to be putting pressure on all the you know the Israelis supposedly to come to a bargaining table to actually I heard that the Israelis were even talk- at least mentioned about giving up some of the Golan Heights Yeah Okay Well I guess it's one of those things that if it's going to really promote a lasting peace if there is not going to be a peace Yeah Oh Yeah Do you think the U S is going to wind up keeping military bases over there I I haven't heard that I watch C N N every once in a while but I I haven't specifically heard anything about that What I thought was interesting is that apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet And then I guess there's still the possibility that hostilities with U S troops could still break out Yeah Do you have relatives over in Israel really Yeah Do you does she ever want to go back to Syria okay No No Do you ever want to go over to Israel okay Yeah Yeah Yeah Okay well who- you know do you have a lot of Kosher foods there at your house Yeah No Kish ki's or knishes <> Oh I got you Still get your Passover Matzi and all that right really I dated I dated a nice Jewish girl for many years up in Chicago and I was the only Goyim at at all the Seder dinners and everything and I used to have to go with rolls of not pocketful of change to buy all this bread the kids would see me <> Not not Not just just enough to get by Okay Oh Wow really Yeah Well they had the matter of fact I just watched Charles Heston this this weekend in the TEN COMMANDMENTS Did you Well that's to me it's really I guess I guess I can intellectually kind of come to grips with all of that But you know emotionally I have a real difficult time believing that that that people that believe in God and love not war and to forgive can't get together You know I mea- I know that the problems are so deep But I mean even within the Muslim religions different sects they can't get together Yeah Or the you know the Catholics and the Protestants up in Ireland You know I mean Yeah Yeah yeah Yeah It sounds like a it sounds like a John Lennon type
