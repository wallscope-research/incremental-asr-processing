Well we we really like the Mexican food you know here in Texas and so we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying them out and so Tia's is probably our favorite restaurant there and I think they have one of the best services that that we really like it No Where's that at Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Really that no we haven't explored you know too many places you know lot of the big name brand I guess chains yeah but we've tried places you know down by the Collin Creek Mall the you know Alvarez and we tried what was across the street El Paso's El Chico's or something yeah something something like that uh-huh uh-huh Yeah yeah yes Yes Oh Uh-huh uh-huh I know I tell I tell you what They are they just they're excellent excellent food I wish I could make them here at home Just can't make those flour tortillas But Well I love I love seafood and I notice they have like the you know The Louisiana Purchase Razzoo's has opened up down you know off of close to six thirty-five Yes I have eaten there Now the only problem note the setup for a negative comment I love the food It's a lot of cajun food and good seafood but the service has always been so strange every time I've been in there Mostly it's been at lunch time and but I hear at night though they have you know the outdoor bar and that's it's really you know kind of lively So it's it's really good All their blackened grill stuff Uh-huh well that sounds great Uh-huh Uh-huh slash error Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh well I I have children and and work and so we we can eat a lot of fast food Uh-huh Yeah I know I I know I I'm so sick of McDonalds and we used to eat there we used to eat there all the time And so now we we we branch out at this Wendy's or some other fast food joint and and cheap too Yeah but but the kids they've got those expensive tastes so they like Tia's so they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff Yeah I know They they they're just spoiled rotten but but no I we love to eat out of course it's just so much easier and simpler yeah So we we usually eat out generally two or three times a week Yeah yeah me too me too So I know I I know that I you know I just work and I'm just tired when I get home and I I just don't feel like cooking And you know on the weekends there's always things to do and so we like to go out to lunch on Saturdays especially Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah now I we've been there twice and and both times I just the food just didn't quite settle with me and I don't know what it was Uh-huh uh-huh Yes and I love Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah family restaurant Uh-huh Now I haven't been there befo- I went to one I think in Ohio or or or somewhere up there but I've never been to that one here I know it's just down the street So Now have you been to Applebee's Yes Yes I I really like that too so that was Oh I've been I've been there twice uh-huh yeah so Salad bar yes
