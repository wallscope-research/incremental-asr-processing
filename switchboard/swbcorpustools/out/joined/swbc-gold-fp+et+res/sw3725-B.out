Okay Probably once every five years Uh-huh Yeah and that is the hardest part about getting the fam- the stuff together and everyone is spread out all over Timbuktu And you Uh-huh Yeah That makes it a lot easier A lot more convenient That is why we only do it once every five or ten years Spec- because it is always that hard to get everyone together Yeah see that is kind of what happened with ours That is why we have not had one in a long time So so to make one successful I mean I mean what do you all do Do you all just start planning real far ahead of time do you all start planning real far ahead of time really <> Yeah Eat a lot It is a lot harder for us because we are like I said we are spread out and so we have to plan anywhere from six well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone can start their vacation time Uh-huh Yeah Yeah is that one of your I mean But you also manage to make them Yeah Yeah You can't really get away Well now that we have been talking about it I I am kind of getting home sick now Because it has been over three years since I have been home to see my grandparents Well my my grandfather is the only one that is still around And see my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically So unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together it is kind of like She was like the glue so Originally I was born in Missouri But you know we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana Mississippi here in Texas but it is harder for everyone to get in get home Well but the majority of them are in like just like how you said in close close quarters So it is easier for us few stragglers to go home Yeah Well how do you all communicate Like to plan it and every thing Do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we are going to do it or do you all like mail out stuff Yeah Well I guess probably the last one I went to I met so many people that I had not seen in probably ten over ten years It was like don't you remember me And I am like no <> Yeah I know Do you I mean is that since +  I mean do you have them every year  Yeah Well I think that is probably why our is probably so interesting is cause we don't have them that often and then when we do and everyone finally does get together it is like after the you know
