I'm Jay in Dallas That keeps you plenty of exercise Well I I have I walked and run ev- almost every morning I've sort of stopped here with the weather change but it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning that would that's fantastic exercise  All right I'd rather get a bicycle but I have an ex- I had an exercise bike in the house but didn't seem to use it enough so somebody sold it in a garage sale and so but I'd like to get a bike and just do do biking outside Yeah It keeps going because I'm fifty-five and it it just gets worse You still want to eat and but you just I think you feel better too if you get on some program like that but Uh-huh Right Oh I know it it it some of it is so tough and especially when somebody's planning lunch for you and they know what what's good for you I think when we do it ourselves we take the easy way sometimes So So anyway thank you for calling All right Bye-bye
