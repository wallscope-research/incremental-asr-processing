Well anyway I I yeah I did forget to ask you What is your name by the way you're Ann Hi But anyway I lot of lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good be a good change if we're going to be talking about the subject t- tonight which in some I guess criminal courts the Yeah Th- the one of which was something something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town and that is and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race Yeah Well they they the the people that the the jury that's trying the officers in that case is is an all white panel And there's been a lot made in the local papers of that fact They have They have They moved it up to the county north of here it's in Ventura and there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously and it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that that Yeah It was everywhere So you know and I I think it would be very difficult to find someone find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on Exactly You know the you know I I'm kind of torn on this issue It's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways I think true But on the other hand it's it's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict you know they're not going to do their job Which is the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there's enough  They well I guess it depends on who you talk to I haven't talked to I haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but I I rather imagine there's there's some snickering about it And a lot of the usually fatalistic here we go again folks kind of stuff No no I you know on on on one hand you know on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's sm- they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy Uh-huh Well Yeah I don't know You know and and again there's something else tha- you know there was a something else along those lines There was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins I don't know if it's it's got it's got as much notoriety but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with the Rodney King problem a girl walked into a Korean owned store and they she had a dispute black girl She she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the with the owner of the store The owner of the store popped her Yeah And and of course they you know the criminal case went up and and the judge gave the woman who shot her shot the girl a practically a suspended sentence I mean it was it was just she gave her no time in jail you know all of these things and then there's we have these we have people wondering around to- with petitions trying to get the judge Yeah Yeah Yeah It would make it would make life easier Yeah But
