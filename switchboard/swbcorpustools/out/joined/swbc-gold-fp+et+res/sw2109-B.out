Okay Mary the the latest one I've seen had to do with a the basically a manhunt and it was it was called MANHUNTER actually the the guy apparently had a a mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people just kill them with with as much blood and and guts as possible It was true it was truly awful It was not one that I picked but it it did show some some some interesting things about the F B I because they were the the the characters trying trying to get him were F B I people and of the of the few good things that were in it it did show a lot about the F B I About the training and and how they go through training and how they try to to develop a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that And it was it was pretty telling about the the the F B I and their procedures Yeah I I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I going I guess Yeah yeah that was great one I loved it You know I haven't seen that one yet and I need to go see it Yeah Uh-huh my You bet especially in the South Well as it as I recall it got some Academy Awards didn't it yeah that's right It it might have one best picture too Yeah That was yeah I I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of of how to act from Dustin Hoffman but Yeah it must have been great just being with him on on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his for his lines and all that stuff Oh Is is the Kmart there That was that was so funny he had to or was it Kmart He had to buy his underwear at Kmart That was hilarious The the I guess the the first the first scene in that movie that really got my attention concerning the the disease and all that was when he dropped the the the toothpicks and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image Unbelievable Yeah Yeah wel- because that's the way they they might seem outwardly but boy there's a lots going on in there Yeah yeah and I the the I think the the best thing about RAINMAN was the the way that they put together the the real awfulness of the of the of the disease only an and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it you know and and and you need to to work with it you know certainly on on a daily basis but then ag- then again work with it toward a good end Not not toward winning in Las Vegas for example Yeah Right right I was I was so impressed with that movie I saw it three times I can I can se- tell you so much about that movie just because it it really rang rang a lot of my my personal background I I have a a brother myself that's that's older and he's not you know nothing nothing of course serious is wrong with him but but we have gone through these these lapses of of a relationship somewhat sometimes and then you know for for for no real you know direct reason I guess we we get into a really good relationship for a while and then you know back and forth so I I was really able to to relate to the the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers That was neat Yeah a lot Uh-huh No question he the he was he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that He likes the bang them up and shoot them up things And and it it was like pulling teeth to go get him to to see it but boy He was he he gave the the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN I mean he certainly didn't he only saw it one time and he didn't go back for more but he he said he enjoyed it and and Yeah yeah and and he really I don't know he he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway But he wa- but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this I'm like come on Yeah And to make it believable I mean I was I was believing it I don't know about any body else but I was it was great He did great Yeah yeah you take care up there and let's hear it for the summertime No no well take care Bye bye
