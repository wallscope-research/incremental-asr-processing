Recently I can't really say recently But I think about about a year ago I bought a product from some company down at in Atlanta Georgia I believe it was one of these one of these mixers These like these juice machines and the the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked you know perfectly okay but I found that it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting after even despite you know diligent washing it it got rusty after about three weeks of use And I don't think it was my fault because i- I you know I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it but it was really it was I had to send it back after like you know the third week because I realized it was like it was not something was very very wrong with the blade what about you Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh slash error Well at least your talking to somebody who counts slash error and your should be you're Uh-huh Right Right right I find up here in the northeast we have well w- we have these mail order companies like L L Bean and they are famous for I guess having really top-notch service They've got I mean I've I've I I have friends and family who order from them because you can you can literally I've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half and even after like eighteen months of you know reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition and they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore they'll they'll actually do things like this I mean they're really they they go- bend over backwards service wise for you I've I've found also a lot of companies nowadays have they have eight hundred numbers you can call I guess if if you call the e- any eight hundred number if you you can call up e- any eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies And actually I've tried that with a few companies lately And they've most of them have been pretty good but I I was one reason why I like I buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that if you buy through Bean or though I guess Bean's one of Bean's big competitors is Land's End out in I guess it's Wisconsin somewhere They they are they're very good about insur- like the customer is always right and you know no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding and they usually get you know they they make things are they ma- make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise Uh-huh slash error Yeah slash error should be 'b' Well I think I guess nowadays with the with the economy the way it is I guess there was a there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are you know things are getting rough out there there's a lot of you know the morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn like you know
