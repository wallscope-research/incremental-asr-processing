No no I work there as a temporary But are you at T I So you have to do the random drug testing about ten or eleven calls Right Oh As contract person we have to do random drug testing too It doesn't bother me I don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything As far as the number of drug users you mean Huh Right Right yeah so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee When I worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person and so we had when we sent temporaries to T I we had to have their drug tested And we did have a couple of cases where we really the person said that they hadn't used anything and their test came back positive and normally we didn't retest them But there were a couple of people that we really thought that they were telling the truth and we retested them like the next day and they came back negative the second time So that that's the only thing I think that might be a little bit of a problem Right Yeah Right yeah not just some doctor's office somewhere really Do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive or do they fire them right away Right Right I think that's really good I know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something Right Yeah some of the stories you read about cocaine that's like people try it one time and they're addicted My husband is a counselor and he works mostly with adolescents So yeah I hear a lot of horror stories about things like that But most of the time it's they get into the wrong crowd first and then they start a drug problem It's usually not a one time accidental thing I don't think well I'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that Yeah it seems if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are that's best way to avoid trouble from what I can gather No not yet we're expecting a baby in July so we're starting Yeah we're really excited about it You know one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing like on a Saturday morning if they've been out at a party Friday night If you're not too sure what's going on he tells parents all the time haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked Right Uh-huh yeah I think that's a really good thing to encourage Right well thanks Uh-huh Yeah Yeah yeah I think it'll be neat Yea is this a typo No I can't think of anything else to say about that either Yeah No I don't work for T I so I get cash Right  Yeah five dollars a call Well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them so I guess we better get off It was good talking to you Bye
