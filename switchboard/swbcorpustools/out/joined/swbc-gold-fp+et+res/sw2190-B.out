well I'm not an expert I just had a little I've I've seen a little pollution in my time It's the the chemicals we were dealing with were a Raid repellent and that was really quite dangerous I'm not certain that that was that that's really a pollution issue I think pollution issue is is is is the argument over over people catching things like respiratory disease Well the you know that that's another arguable issue and I I've seen the assuming you can buy into global warming I bi- Well did you see Carl Sagan on SIXTY MINUTES on when he was talking about when if if the if the war started in in Kuwait and they'd set those all th- it was it was it was interesting but I'm just curious what he has to say now that they've got them all lit Yes And his argument was was that that you would see a a year with no summer Which actually happened And it it ac- yes it actually happened it was a volcano erupted and it was high enough up but they had some people from the national meteorological center I think it was which is the national anyway research people and they said that the that the pollution would not go high enough And it's going to be interesting to see if Carl Sagan and his billions and billions of stars may have once made a mistake but th- th- th- the the com- the general the opinion among among the meteorologists at I'm member of the American Meteorological Society and an- Yeah I do But I'm I th- I did that in my No I'm a planner a production planner But I I I'm in the active reserves as a weatherman so I I keep up from time to time but what  the the argument is that that maybe there isn't global warming and maybe there is But if there is we probably could do something about it now and if there isn't if there isn't and we do some the right things I think how do you feel about about all this smog and th- stuff on cars Well do you have an older car I I have been working on an older car but it to- yeah Well I'm restoring one I'm not having any problem it's a seventy And the But did you have another ques- you said you had another quest- e- No I didn't see that that I know that the that's Well that they called nuclear winner and and I suppose that's that's the ultimate pollution problem Well it Well the Chernobyl accident actually because the circulation budget as high as it went covered a fairly remarkable amount they did some tracers and they I I think it's drawn in I think gets in there I can't think of the other trace but I saw a a presentation on on that and they it went quite a long ways but I I I guess I can be a little sympathetic but you know there's some argument that in in in the blue grass of Kentucky that the Smoky Mountains that that's the the pine trees giving off pollution and But the but when you se- when you get up in the morning in in Dallas and and see all that haze from west Texas is that is that pollution Well it that's the thing is that I think I think Dallas really does have a problem in this the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel burning fuel the problem is is it's like Los Angeles People don't people don't want to use mass transit so But who wants to who wants to ride a bus Well my boss drives forty miles one way each day And one of the guys that works with me drives forty-five miles And and they don't think it well I guess they do think something of it but not even to you know you consider how much but then you get into all these issues of of whether it it's the types of pollution and what it's doing to your lungs and are we going to die of of respiratory so we all move out of the out of downtown so we get away from the the smog My my wife grew up in southern California and they moved out to the valley before Los Angeles wh- when the valley was clean And now the valley is not and so people move out one more valley and Yes yes Well do General Motors apparently has one that they're they're testing I think it's no it's alcohol vehicles that they're testing But they suppose  Well the ROAD and TRACK was talking about that this apparently General Motors has some they apparently think they're close Well th- there's still a lot of research I was over in in the research lab a couple I guess it's been about a month ago and saw this research it was a little light that says solar solar powered research Yeah Well do you work in that C building I'm at well I'm in I'm in the C building been there for all my life  Well that's been a con- I know the focal plain array is they were taking space to a long time Well the problem is that gas at a dollar a gallon you know who wants to yeah I mean we want to not pollute but at a dollar a gallon it's hard to beat the amount of energy you get from Well I thought I saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol they had one with spots on it and something I didn't go but i- wa- it was showing they I mean an article No I didn't I didn't go so I wh- They've done a lot Well ther- Well they it's interesting though because my cars are older and so I didn't have to if you live in Dallas County you have to have your have to have it checked and it's I had a friend with a Fiero that they tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of terrible getting that pinned and so apparently
