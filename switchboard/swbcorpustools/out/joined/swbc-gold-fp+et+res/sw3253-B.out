Hi When I think of camping I think of of bugs and sleeping bags and and tents like along the Appalachian Trail No I have never been camping No Do you do much Really Where you live now or Did you camp up in Maryland or okay I bet Uh-huh okay Well my cou- husband and and his uncle especially grew up camping together and they they just love it and they're planning a trip into Canada this I guess in about a year and they're going to spend about a week and a half camping up there No this is this is a a man's trip So they're really looking forward to that so And see I was I was never exposed to it so I I feel like I'm a little bit too much of a city city mouse to try doing it What's the best part about it to to you the the quiet the getting away Wow Now do you usually like do you usually go and there's lots of other people around or is it pretty much isolated Yeah Yes good grief That that does sound neat but I don't think I I've got quite enough nerve to do that I know my husband's gone for several days on the Appalachian Trail before and he said that you can a lot of times you can go for you know a good day before you'll see or meet anybody else on the trail So it's not for the faint of heart I don't think Oh Uh-huh I think it would be yeah Well that sounds really neat Well I don't know we talk about sometimes going up to Chincoteague and I maybe like you said start out slow and and kind of get used to it and find out that it maybe it's not as bad as I I fear it might be Yeah
