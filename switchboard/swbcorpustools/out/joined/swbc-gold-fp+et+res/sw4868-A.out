Budgeting activity in our household I has is kind of an informal kind of situation We we you know put actually what happens is is my check gets automatically deposited I don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore It just gets deposited And and and my my wife you know you know looks at all those bills that come in and you know and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them You see and so our our budgeting w- we really don't have a formal budgeting situation Every time I've ever tried one it's I've just got wrapped in my inertia And I've just decided not to pursue it what what's your budget situation You know well a- a- actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets Isn't it Uh-huh Well my you know my my parents too You you you were born in in the in the late thirties or early forties Yeah  Uh-huh Well that that's good Well we we buy what well we just got through buying a twenty-five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher And and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge Along with my trip to Japan which was was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars you know Right I mean we just we got a monster you know bill coming in But but we also have zero in- interest being paid And we pay it off as as it goes Yeah So we never really get that much over over extended  Yeah We're we're doing that We have you know th- this is our our our big we did redecorating Two you know two new pieces in the ref- in the family room and new carpet I mean we just we've just been spending spending spending Bu- but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year So we're you know we don't have that Yeah it's it's about time that we did that But th- the the terrible part about it I've looked at it all Seems to be clearly 2 slash units  and it all looks still pretty good to me Why why we need to replace it But but un- unfortunately my my my wife really <> feels as though it's it's just been an inappropriate thing to to I mean that rug is thirteen years old why not replace it I mean I say it might go for another thirteen but too late we'll never find that out And You know I I I don't spend that much money I just we just sort of have had you know too many obligations to you know we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they they got through school And that was the major you know decade of expenses you know So we we feel as but as far as any formal budgeting you know I I we just apparently have been very fortunate When we went want to go out to eat we go out to eat We never really you know have to program money for that or make choices you know But we don't have that uproarious a a lifestyle After all we're
