Well yes I do I think I'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to to deal with in some quality way I think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job Do you Do you have children in the public school system Is that right You were a bookkeeper Oh no Well I'm I have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back and and I'm just really in a dilemma if that's what you know I love to work with children and to teach them but I'm really having questions if if I can deal with that system and and have a good conscience about you know what I do I don't think I don't think it's the teachers I think it's the system but Right What child's going to say something some parent's going to overreact to that's that's true Well it's it's hard on the children too I think you know because the the teachers are overworked and just like a mommy that's overworked you're not at your best you know I have two I have in the system one is in ninth grade and one is in seventh grade and them I'm home schooling my kindergartner this year We live in a district that has open classrooms and I wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her Yes You too Oh Still at it Well the explanation I was was given about you know they they seemed to admit that it wasn't working but they didn't have the money to restructure but looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with I mean some kind of partitions you know Just yeah goodness Oh Were they Well we were from North Carolina and of course North North Carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education I think they rank about forty-ninth but our children got a very good education there they were in the magnet school program and a lot of their classes from the time they were about third grade they they changed classes several times during the day which has its pros and cons but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes and it was wonderful so you know I'm coming to to Plano thinking Well gosh it's going to be really great it's ranked so much better Isn't that interesting I I I don't understand how they get this this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money I don't know I guess so Well my son is at Clark this year too so we're Yeah And he's pleased with his classes I I I don't guess I've been in the high school long enough to to know what to expect really you know how to judge it Well that's good Yeah Well Eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any so that's interesting but he his grades I haven't seen them yet but supposedly they're good so That's right
