That's it What do you think are possible changes in the way trials are conducted these days Do you like the way some people in there for instance really take over and we have no way of knowing whether they are legitimately right or wrong and so forth What do you think about these things Y- so you're saying yo- you think the judge should actually have the final say  Yes I know what you mean Well I hadn't thought of it from that point of view before I have been in a fairly important trial and what bothers me is I was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and accurate decision That's the part that bothered me about it I really think that the the the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they are guilty or not But I also think that the jury should be very very carefully more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely intel- intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accu- accurate decisions I hate to see people brought in who basically have lived out in the country and don't know much about any of this stuff and and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time That's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem That would be certainly nice sh- let's say we we would have fifty percent of them law students anyway Yeah Yeah Uh-huh That's a very neat idea and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial That would be a a really good thing to do So it's   For goodness sakes Uh-huh they saw the husband get Yeah Uh-huh They would find something wrong with it Did they really Uh-huh That is a shame You'd think there would be enough people who saw the accident other than his wife to to also make statements and they have nothing to gain one way or the other So if they say a certain way then why not believe them Yeah Uh-huh
