Well it seems to me that that I do not know whether the jury system I I should not say I do not know I do not feel very stronger that the jury system should be changed It seems to have worked time immemorial And when difficult decisions are made they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on I know in some cases now in some states depending on the criminal code a unanimous verdict is not required And indeed some juries are no longer twelve people they are down to as little as small as six people   in I think in petty  +  in in in in  minor  felonies and and misdemeanor trials I think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing simply because there is always there is there is always a jury that might be swayed by the moment to either to be too lenient or too vengeful I guess Yeah But I mean is not that is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world If if if they keep giving everybody hundred year sentences and the people in various states it does not seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons Or even in for that matter repair the the lack of judges and and and other Yeah yeah you know that might be it I mean they they certainly I do not I don't know how it is in Virginia but in Florida now at eighteen years someone was just sentenced to eighteen years I heard it on TODAY without any specific recommendation for waving the normal procedures And the eighteen years will translate into something like four point seven if every if the if the prisoner is a model prisoner and indeed the present overcrowding conditions prevail Plus I guess there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial So yeah you might be right about that I I I do not know it just seems to me that only about from what I read only about ninety percent of the ca- only about ten percent of the pa- cases come for trial anyway And only about f- four or five percent of in the in the very end or less than less than half the trials that go to less than half the cases that go to trial end up w- with with the jury actually making the verdict That most of it is plea bargained half way through or or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway But how do you feel about the about the jury system itself Do you do you think that should be changed Or do you do you know in Virginia whether it is if they have smaller juries or Yeah Yeah Well I guess we Yeah I guess we always focus on criminal trials with th- with the jury But I know you have a right to ask for a jury in in any sort of a case that even where damages are are are are the result of some sort of a an action that you are bringing against someone else You can ask for that to be heard before a jury Takes a heck of a long time I guess to get there in some states I I I do not know I should imagine Virginia from what I read is like every other state It it is faced with enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system Because I guess everywhere I read that there is a shortage of judges Not that they won't appoint them but there is no budget for them I guess Or and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the clerk court clerks So it seems no I I I do not think I would change it The more I verbalize it I I do not think I would want to change the system I do not know what we would replace it with Yes and yet there are there are so many there are so many people in prison I mean the prison population as far as I I you know my impression of it is that it has that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty I mean it so has our I guess our population has grown some too But there there definitely is you know to me the one of the worst things that could ever happen from what I read and see and understand I mean I do no think I could handle prison I mean it would be very difficult Well there must be a ca- a a a very great degree of that But but there again I I do not know if the the jury system itself comes in to play there I would think that one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability of course th- it is a constitutional right that the press must have here is th- the interviewing of jurors after the trial I mean that it seems to me that that that when a jury makes a decision they should not be asked before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision I mean I do not I imagine there is a certain certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that But I I would think I if I did anything I would protect the juror from from any sort of an inquisition after Yeah Yeah yeah Well I do a lot of business up in Washington I was there during the during the trial actually yeah Yeah yeah yeah I felt that way I felt I felt no but Yeah I always balanced in the in the situation I remember the jurors I thought to myself how did how did they only I think they only found him guilty on one count Which was not even which was a class something felony Which was not even punishable to the degree that they thought it But I do not know maybe when you are there in the r- in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got to make a judgment on somebody And the prosecutors do a lousy job or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it I mean I I am not making excuses for That might be it I think I am getting a call coming in All right nice talking with you Thank you
