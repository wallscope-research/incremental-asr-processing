Okay it's not such a bad idea to think about judges you know taking the idea of sentencing in- into their hands versus you know the jury especially if it's a highly publicized case such as you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read certain things in regards to cases like the Dahlmer case in Milwaukee and stuff So it's it may be an idea to think about you know cost Trying to find a jury so you can get a jury as far as they may say they're not biased but deep down they are a- against this person or whatever so I don't think it's such a bad idea to think about So Exactly Uh-huh Yeah Catches you off guard doesn't it Uh-huh I didn't think they were either I thought the sentencing was done by the judge I mean it's either guilty or not guilty Changes Uh-huh sure Yeah yeah Exactly Exactly Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Exactly Uh-huh yeah That's kind of how I you know in certain cases I can see them going just basically with a judge guilty or not guilty verdict simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small maybe you did a crime that was burglary or whatever and it goes into the court case or whatever and it's not highly publicized But when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the NATIONAL ENQUIRER or whatever it's the idea that person might initially have this thought well jeez this person's guilty no matter what I'm not going to listen to the facts or and and con their way into getting past the lawyers and getting through that But also there's aspect of cost and I I'm not quite sure how much cost it does take for the judicial system to try and call a jury whether it's very costly or if it's something that's not costly or what You know being that I'm not in the that area I really don't know But I wonder if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay I know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work Or at least give them the time off from work whether it's I think it's with pay If I remember jury duty is with pay And it's not Uh-huh Paid right Uh-huh Some that may decide not to
