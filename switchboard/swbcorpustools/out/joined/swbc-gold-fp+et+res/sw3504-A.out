so my favorite team is about the Rangers Yeah I'm telling you You think they'll sign Ruben No Right Yeah I think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other Hispanic players I think that's going to be the big problem Right Yeah Right Oh Right I think they just want to stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here But Right Right yeah Right Right That's true But they were talking about trading him if they're not able to sign him and use the money that it would take to sign the guy you know to pay for pitchers or you know what it what it what they what else they need Because they've got the hitting but they need the pitching  I know Yeah it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working you know your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game It's real aggravating but That's right It's always got Yeah it's always it's always wondered me why I mean they act as though this area is not you know a big metropolitan area but you think we'd someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the the the players we need Just real aggravating to because I've lived here you know since well I was born and raised here so I've been a Ranger fan since about seventy-seven so it's a lot of losers It's about to get you know as bad as the Cubs or whoever you know Right Right I'm telling you Right I think this town would go crazy if they ever got a even a playoff team T- I mean It would be packed And they got that new stadium they are building So at least at least that will be exciting when we get that but it's hard to say It's going to be depending on where the what they do with Ruben Sierra and I mean I'm getting tired of them going into each year saying you know Bobby Witt is the answer and Kevin Brown is the answer and man that's getting old you know These guys have been pampered I mean it's time to to either you know put out or shut up And Right And Valentine and Greave they're about to get you know they're about to get old But I like this Sandy Johnson
