There we are well when they were little we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks and things of that sort and b- I had two boys They were both interested in things like model rockets so we would go to the football field and set off model rockets Uh-huh well that's good mine were not terribly sporting they both did T-ball and soccer in grade school but neither one of them carried on the sports after that wonderful that's great Yeah I Sure Uh-huh  My goodness Well we didn't have any avid activities like that they they were interested in a lot of things but nothing to quite that depth I guess But we would my goodness Well we did go to things like aquariums and natural history museums and zoos and all of those things that one does with kids Uh-huh yes really Yeah Yeah Yeah well I started working half-time when they were at the nursery school But I yet Uh-huh Yeah Well I think it they need you in different ways You want to be around for the crisis and things like that and but it's not quite so much the hand-holding and peanut butter and jelly making Well it lo- o- the one trend I would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers there are fewer of them home in the afternoons and I don't think it needs to be the mothers but I think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours  Yes I think that's true but I d- I also think that's at least in my experience truer of girls than boys Even when I was there my boys didn't share all that much with me and certainly not to the extent I did with my mother Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Who would they ask Or what would they do Uh-huh Yeah well I did too We were close to my maternal grandparents I mean just a few miles and close enough to visit my paternal grandparents you know quite often They were fifty miles away but Uh-huh  Right Well when my kids were quite small we lived close to both sets of grandparents and they saw them a lot but they don't have any cousins or they didn't their their cousins are about ten years younger So they never played together or anything And there are only two of them and they didn't live in the same town That's right Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Well everyone makes it's own model but i- it seems that there should be some continuity and it's helpful to have things that become family traditions and that sort of thing Uh-huh Yeah well that's the kind of thing that they will remember though Uh-huh Ours finally disintegrated We had a felt one that was li- it was a Christmas tree that had a little trinket for each day that was pinned on the date and then you took it off and put it on the tree so at the end you had a decorated tree And it finally got moth-eaten we threw it way last year How nice I see How cute Uh-huh Yeah I'm sure he appreciated that Uh-huh Yeah Well you were saying what other trends are there and one just occurred to me because I was editing a book about it recently and that is the trend in a lot of lower class areas for the grandmothers to be raising the children And that's a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs Uh-huh Right Well we had a sociologist at the center where I work who was writing a book on multigeneration matriarchies in a way where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she's still living at home with the mother and Yeah
