No As many years as we've been involved in one I really feel fortunate in that there even though there are problems they're not a lot of problems where I teach But from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems with dropouts when I was in Minnesota last summer there was a teacher who said that on a given day she didn't know how many of her students would show up and sometimes they didn't even show up for class and she taught in high school in inner city Minneapolis And they just didn't come to school And I cannot imagine being able to do much of anything when they don't even come to school Uh-huh I think so too The home is the key I think really is because if the home does not place a high priority on education and the- the main goal is making money now and it may be a survival thing for the family which you can understand So Right Your education That's right It's what's wrong with families and if if children come to school yes insecure and their mo- biggest concern is survival both at home they don't know what to expect at home They don't feel secure there they don't know what's going to happen just out front of their apartment complex For example that child that was shot how can they concentrate on schooling I agree with you I think that's the main problem And school's now are supposed to solve social problems mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security And that's overwhelming No It isn't True I think they there has to be at least a counselor and we just recently had a counselor at elementary We didn't even have counselors in elementary We have always though had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids and they divided them up between three counselors but for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor and they decided that didn't work So they started dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees through you know through all three years of middle school And I think that would give them more security in going to the counselor If they have a rapport with their counselor Now if they don't I hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them And occasionally that happens But it is frightening b- Because education is the key to our future and if we have children who are not getting their education for one reason or another then what are we going to do with them What's going to happen to them Are they going to be able to work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison And our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them That's no good Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I think one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody There will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world where they don't try to educate everyone That's one of the things that we do We try to educate everyone We're the only country in the world that does And let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they're willing you know to work and have some ability They can do that Uh-huh Well you know if we can keep them in school Uh-huh then that that helps a lot I think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too It's scary to me I We are I would imagine that we've talked the amount of time necessary Okay Alright We were in Austin yesterday Oh how exciting that is wonderful What an experience
