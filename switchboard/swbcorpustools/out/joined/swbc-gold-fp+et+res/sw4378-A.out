Okay You were helping your parents Uh-huh So you're remodeling Okay Well I I just live in a I live in an apartment now I two summers ago I went to Massachusetts and I went with a friend of mine and we undertook a building house And this was a a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions and it's preconstructed you might say And we started in we started from an empty lot with trees and stuff on it and we had to cut them down and clear the lot We had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement Pour the basement and went from the ground up Our one of our main problems was well in Massachusetts I thought I was going to well it was a a fun time but I thought gosh summer time you know Well all it ever did was rain and thunder storms And one thing is that we're we had we were going to pour the basement foundation And we're in the process and it started pouring down rain And I guess we had most of it done but the end was result what happened was that some of the the wa- a lot of water settled on the top and it really didn't give a very good finish and some of the it was sort of sandy and and not a very good finish But it turned it was okay and it's only the basement floor so it was okay But it kept us pretty busy It was only there was well me and my friend and then we just had like two helpers and sort of a a family type it wasn't you know like a commercial project or something It was sort of just you know gets your get his you know my bro- my brother and well maybe you know my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes And and then materials coming in and so we're we're hopping around pretty good But overall yeah we got it done and it's a three bedroom two bath house and it's pretty neat Yeah So Well it was for my friend's parents They had some property there and they'd lived in this this old it's sort of like a farm you might say And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something And his mom just wanted a a new house You know that has been her dream And so we did that And she was really pleased with it So it came really great so So what why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot Where you live it gets very hot And that's why you an- and the windows have you what type of windows are you putting in Because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in you know the solar game Have you what what are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or okay Okay Uh-huh Okay these so you have the sash windows in Did t- did it go up and down I see Uh-huh Yes there's a problem with those Those are they usually most of the time don't open very well Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh And they also there they they a lot of vibration and it causes the glass to crack and it's a never ending problem So So I haven't I haven't been in any really home repair things lately I
