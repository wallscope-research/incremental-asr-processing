Okay what do you think are some current trends in the way families spend time together based on what you've seen Yeah <> Really Are you newly married or Yeah Same same situation here I've been married about ten months so Yeah I can I can I know what you mean Yeah Is he a hunter and a fisher and all that That's we- that's wild Uh-huh Yeah from the people I've talked to I don't know if I should bring this into it but a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more where they could manage their own schedule and they could spend more time with their kids because they look back and you know they're all like kind of regretful I think Uh-huh Yeah same here Yeah At T I is that where you work It's really kind of sad some of the people that I work with they like when I worked on second shift their paren- their kids go to school during the day and then they wouldn't see them at night because they would be in you know at work and the kids are all ready in bed And so it was kind of like they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses This relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends or something you know So it was really sad jus- you know that a lot of families have to well you know have to have dual income A lot of people choose to which is fine But you know then the kids kind of suffer Uh-huh <> Yeah Yeah Yeah  I know Unfortunately that's probably true do you think s- the the parents spend quality time with their kids are do you think it's more like watching T V and stuff like that not really Yeah Yeah <> it's always that way unti- until it's too late Yeah it's true What's what are some other questions they have I'm not sure I know my parents are growing up I guess they never spent much time watching T V In fact I've never seen my mom turn on the T V we didn't really have one Yeah and and they spent a lot of time like outside with us and stuff but you know my dad had his own business and it was easier for them to do that but I I don't know it was I guess I didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time Yeah Yeah that's a good way to put it Yeah that's a pretty good way to put it If I had kids well if you had kids what kind of things do you hope to do <> Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Do volunteer work and be in clubs and stuff yeah I agree I hope that happens in my case Yeah Yeah I know Yeah and what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids That may not necessarily be consistent with yours Yeah I well I don't even think we had I don't even remember them being around when we were little Yeah Sure is well <> I guess we could ring this off since we we've exhausted all of our ideas we seem to agree Yeah so Yeah you too I wish you the best Okay thanks Bye-bye
