Hi You didn't try re- rewallpapering You just Did you use a textured paint or  Well did you get good results <> Yeah But it just didn't it didn't it didn't cover it Well we did a we moved last August and we're getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we decided we went to I've forgotten one of the paint stores and they just said you can get by and I forgotten what it was you put down and then you can just paint right over the dark Well more or less After about half dozen coats it looks reasonable but it kept the the dark it was just a real dark wood grain type paneling and it was smooth and and we would we put this stuff on and and it supposedly textured it or did something to it and but because of the b- dark behind it it was really hard to cover and <> Yeah It was something like that although we sort of when we got through I wished we hadn't done it because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it and we were painting it and trying to do you know make it and it it really was you know the advice they give you is the job was considerably tougher than we thought particularly when you try to I was talking to somebody else who who had a lot of wood panelling and they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate and it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot panelling and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something Have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted Yeah Yeah that's quite reasonable problem i- have you have you tried matching paint lately My wife we we built a shed over the long way actually it took this is not on the topic but I did finish it But my wife went to the Home Depot I think it was and and took a a copy took a piece of brick and she wanted to paint the shed it's it's a wooden shed and she took it and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint And they got and and in fact she put some right ba- she got they mixed a gallon of it and it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint and it does it electronically some something magic Yeah you know they but it's electronic you put your sample under this thing and it looks at it in- and and determines the and it it's really remarkable the problem they had and then they wanted some gray to do the to do the trim And but they didn't didn't occur to them that that they could have taken a sample from I forgotten listen this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something but anyway It's it's remarkable That's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the you know you want this you want this to look like this and you want that to look like that and of course if it's all white you're all right but when you start getting into colors have you had problems getting colors to match  So Gosh So you so what's your what's the solution then my Well at least you'll get very good at it right You could go back and and paint the whole thing over that's this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting because it it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do I'll just do a little bit here and a little there Although the it's it we almost one day we painted the house to we painted we painted the whole inside and it had all this dark trim We thought you know we did the one wall but the other trim I'm trying to think I think I think we left most of it because it gets to be they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't the mold everything is white In a new house everything is white good luck We wound up selling the house Actually I I don't know whether it made actually it does it's interesting that the white makes the rooms look bigger One of the in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding like picture frames I don't know what you call that that actually that are along the walls you know up a couple of feet And my wife painted those the insides of those dark blue And it makes the room look remarkably smaller The trim is still white The the molding but by and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive but it makes the room look smaller which is which is it explains why they why they have everything white but  I + you wouldn't think that I well maybe maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff but not particularly because the house has so many windows it has the the the living room has four good size windows and well of course at night but with the we have we have a soccer field that's about a hundred yards from our house and the lights shine right at our house It's kind of we didn't know that when we bought the house but Yeah We have a lot of light yeah And well it it it well it's just I think it's just the the the dark blue to about three feet and then above that we left it white so Anyway it didn't it didn't change but the the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away it didn't it kind of bled under the masking tape which I guess is probably the topic we're we're really on to that that the masking is you have to do that very very carefully That's right You can work yourself to death Well I'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend It's kind of frustrating Well I've got to go to a meeting It's been good talking to you Okay Good-bye
