That sounded like one Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah excuse me just a minute I'm on the other line Karen <> I'm sorry Okay she yeah well the the results I I hear what you're you're saying about the results And it's what to do about it I guess is the the big thing I'm I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my my wife teaches school here in Plano And I know that the results that they get out of the system sometime is is certainly not you know up to what the effort they put into it you know I've seen that for years yeah Uh-huh Yeah I've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the the home environment And it if no matter what they do in the the classroom if they go home at night and you know it's all totally undone The the thing that that Karen my wife has has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what no matter how bad their teachers are no matter what a lousy system they're in or anything else these people somehow manage to you know push on through and are successful It's unfortunately probably what maybe twenty-five or thirty percent of them do that Well ye- that would be be at the absolute most And you know those those that you know come out you know fall out of the system that are are real trouble I I wonder whether that's just a a part of the system you know if you know in a democracy where you know people have kind of a freedom to sort of do what they want you know there there's an inefficiency there and you've got to let those you know those Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah And sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive you know you from the minute that you walk in until yo- until you leave your your competing against somebody else or your competing against a system or or something you know and then a lot of the- there is a personality type I believe that is really noncompetitive They're cooperative rather than competitive and when they get into a real competitive system they just say well what the heck and tend not to you know do too awful well Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh I would think so yeah Yeah yeah Yeah it right survival becomes more of a priority than than education and unfortunately you know there's there's and old joke about you know education's wasted on the youth anyway You don't you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway I know when I went to school my attitude was kind of one of you know these people are you know taking a tremendous amount of my time you know and I've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again I guess today that would be some how or other there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing but The the cure some of the cures that I've heard for this that that sort of make sense most teachers after they have taught for a very long especially at the the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately And it's kind of these intervention programs Now a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism and that's communism and that's you know and then it gets political But boy Uh-huh yeah yeah Well you know the the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable There are kids families that should just simply be taken out of the homes you know And you know just removed from those situations or they're never going to get anywhere But yet politically that is not a very popular view I'm sure that if you you know ran on a platform of you know we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them out of the home Yeah you know how far you're going to get with that but unfortunately it's it's something like that in lieu of that you know is the intervention programs in school where the these kids are are spotted fairly early on and you know there's well that's get to be a problem in Texas you know because different school systems have got more or less money to take care of that sort of thing you got counselors and all that But you know you can counsel a kid eight hours a day and then he goes home and and you know in the in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or or something like that or they don't care You know mamma wha- guess what I did in school today well who cares you know True Yeah Yeah Yeah I'm I don't know if you've ever had too much to do with especially Asian Japanese families coming here in Plano we've got quite a few engineering types people who have come from Japan and they put their kids in the U S schools and they're appalled You know not so much at what the schools are teaching but what they let the kids get away with You know they they see most they're they're quite upset about the the disruptive influence of school Most of them would say you know those people should be removed from the school system And in Japan they would be you know But here again you get back into a political thing where Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah were you at Baylor Yeah did you go to Baylor okay I'm Yeah Uh-huh well that's that's it you you don't have you don't have the view I graduated from Texas Tech more than two years ago I guarantee and you know I kind of look back at it sometimes well that was a lot of fun but we- you know I'm not sure that that I took the greatest advantage of you know what I went through there Uh-huh
