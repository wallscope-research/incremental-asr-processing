Do you get a chance to do it at home or do you mostly like catch up while you're at work Do you have a chance to look through the WALL STREET JOURNAL I'm not sure what you do  Well the- I understand that Well and you have a little bit better newspaper The DALLAS MORNING NEWS is a good paper Lubbock is kind of small and the A Js kind of dominant There's no competition so what you get is what you get We used to take the paper every day and I finally quit taking it because it stacked up I never got around to reading it and so I try to take you know weekend papers and then during the week I catch up you know on the radio on the way to work or if I'm traveling around at lunch or on the way home and hopefully I'm sitting down by the ten o'clock news to where I can kind of get a recap on T V No Yeah It is Uh-huh I see We- it's frustrating to me because I really wish that I did have more I don't know what do I want to say I wish that I was around more news It's frustrating when I don't know what's going on I feel like it's hit and miss and I haven't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis Somebody will say did you hear about this that happened last week and it might be local and it might be national and I'm like no I missed that one Yeah Uh-huh Yeah that's true That's true oh no <> A little bit that worries me because I feel like the news is so biased And yes they report facts and yes you can get an idea of what's going on but you know it's an and I wish they would just report the incident and then leave the commentaries out But so many times you get well this is my opinion of what he meant by that and I'm like who are you to judge You know just report the facts Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh And I feel like they sensationalize things that shouldn't be sensationalized I feel like they focus too much on things that I don't know you know so much during the Gulf War they would ask questions that you wouldn't want broadcast It's like if you tell us the answer to that you're telling our enemy what your strategy is But they keep asking these questions and I thought it was really well I don't know asinine actually Stupid Uh-huh yes I agree Yeah Yeah that's true that's true and it's frustrating So I guess I guess when I get to listen to the news it's it's probably television or radio I see very little paper but I I don't get to see that as much as I want and when I do I'm wondering why I wanted to see it so bad Yeah Exactly exactly Well I'm glad tha- it makes me feel like I'm not alone though in the world I I used to think that I was probably the only one that just I don't know was running around so much I look at other women workers or men at work that have kids and families and I'm like how do they seem so together all the time I always feel like I'm running a rat race So I guess news is just part of that rat race for me Yeah Exactly Well Yeah that's incredible too Well I appreciate talking to you Have a good evening Bye-bye
