Okay now when you baby-sit what age group children do you sit with <> Uh-huh I'd think so Uh-huh Now was this a one parent or two parent family One parent How much time did she spend with them <> Uh-huh <> Uh-huh <> Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Yeah  you say your you go to school And what are you studying Well sounds like your getting a lot of experience in communicating with children <> Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah <> Uh-huh Well that that certainly can happen now if you you say you're in communications what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to Public relations so so you would have a job with a company Rather than radio or television or newspapers or what have you Yeah and then you'd be willing to give up your job to stay home and with or stay with the children Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh <> Uh-huh <> Uh-huh <> Uh-huh uh-huh Well that that's is an advantage of being in the education field I spent thirty-four years in education Yes and so I started out with college and then went to high school and then I preferred the high school age level much better than I did the college because you have a closer relationship with the students that I taught physical education <> Uh-huh Well I I found that it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time And and it worked out fine from that standpoint plus the fact that when I left usually my husband was seldom home for maybe forty-five minutes or so and then our son he had to get on the bus and he did get on the bus it was his responsibility and he never ever thought of not going to school he said in view of the fact that he was certain I had a hot line to his school Because I well I I was in physical education then and I just kept getting pushed into administration wound up in administration and so he thought surely that I or I would have bought a hot line to know if he ever skipped school which of course was not the case and I wouldn't have checked on him However there are there are points both directions in that from the standpoint of parents working and not working I listened to more than one parent say I don't know what this child wants I'm working two jobs they each have their own television they each have their own telephone they each have their own rooms they each have this they each have that I'd say but what they don't have is you Absolutely And I think out because that is the way of getting attention That's right  <> Uh-huh Right And we certainly we need more of that we need more parents willing to supervise though we've had such a breakdown in the family structure from the standpoint of of church and school and everything along the way And that I think has contributed much to the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that we're having that the students parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very very beginning and I think my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one two and three To get the students off to a good start let them have positive experiences from the lower levels so they want to continue learning and keep going and not wait until they're they're in the ninth and tenth grades it's too late then you cannot reverse that trend at that point Right And while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school and they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point And that is just as valuable at that time as to the rush in the elementary Yes right Right And the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football and I did keep statistics for his team and his Dad did take movies of the football team and movies of the basketball team and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time So wh- I feel that I learned a great deal from my students with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents And a thing such as one of the biggest complaints I well remember because I spent a lot of time with seniors was carrying their when I was your age I didn't have this or that and I know I never ever said that because I knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people Yes and I had to deal with their problems and I could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect and our son would share this and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of of lines So that I think he benefited from my experiences No No he works for a different company Yeah in the Dallas area but when he went away to coll- and he was on the lawns from the time he was in the seventh grade and a small and all the way through college and he held three jobs Wally was in college Could this Wally be "while he "  and we didn't even know it He didn't even tell us that he had three jobs but when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account and we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go if he got married he was on his own if he flunked out he was on his own
