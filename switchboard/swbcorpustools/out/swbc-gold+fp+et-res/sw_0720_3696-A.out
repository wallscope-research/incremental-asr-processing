 <> Hi 
 I'm Carol 
 and I'm calling from Garland Texas
 Oh okay 
 Because yesterday I talked to someone upstate I'm not even sure where 
 and my husband talked to the people in Utah 
 so Um anyway let me press one
 Okay um 
 let me see I think we've only planned one family reunion in our life 
 so we don't do this too often 
 Um most of my family's in California 
 but my husband's is in San Antonio 
 and so we did this in San Antonio 
 and um it was an experience that I won't do again 
 Um well it wasn't that big of a family 
 but um it just got out of hand 
 and um so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and um how much um beverages we were going to need and this and that 
 and oh it just grew and grew and grew
 and um when the time came only about half that amount of people came 
 So it wasn't you know 
 you have to really just get an accurate amount 
 and 
 but overall we all had a good time 
 We saw people we hadn't see in a while 
 so 
 No 
 It was all in the San Antonio area 
 But it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing 
 and we're going Oh my gosh 
 So 
 Uh-huh 
 basically 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 I think you're right
 <> Yeah
 Your family's from where
 Oh no
 Uh-huh
 Oh those are nice
 And I'm sure they're a lot more organized too because they've done it before
 That's great 
 Oh
 Yeah
 That makes a big difference too 
 I know everybody's real eager to participate 
 Yeah 
 well that's great 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 more people want to come back again
 Yeah 
 that's good
 uh my grandmother in California is um 
 this is my dad's side of the family is planning a reunion um this spring 
 but we won't be going because um I don't know how they thought of this it's going to be on a cruise 
 and um it seems like most of the family is uh going you know all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are most of them are going 
 but it's too costly for us 
 But anyway they're going to go on a cruise
 and um it sounds really neat it really does
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 And a friend of mine um she plans her family reunion um every year 
 and they go camping 
 and she says they have the greatest time 
 and she says usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person 
 but she said they all go camping 
 and they have a really good for the whole weekend 
 So that's 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Right now we only have two children 
 so I
