 Hi
 Yeah 
 actually I agree that that's an interesting thing 
 I believe for civil suits it's not unanimous right 
 but for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law
 Yeah 
 I actually thought I'd read that too 
 and that's why I phrased it that way
 I wonder 
 yeah the difference could be that for uh if there is such a thing state felonies versus federal felonies that things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote 
 and things that are under state jurisdiction even criminal don't require 
 but I don't know what the laws 
 do you think that that's an unreasonable uh requirement that they be unanimous
 Yeah 
 that would be an interesting change 
 It was also allow the uh idea that if you had one person who was uh very disagreeable that I mean it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because uh the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt uh criterion that it uh increases the likelihood of getting the proper judgment 
 So I think if anything it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision
 Yeah 
 actually I thought that that would be very interesting thing to do 
 I would like to do that 
 I've been out here twenty some years 
 and I've been called uh three different times 
 but I've never actually even made it into the jury box because there have always been a number of people 
 and I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions 
 Uh I 
 yeah 
 I also think that would be really good 
 I 
 Uh-huh
 Well the one thing that I know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three or some such number that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure going on 
 and that uh peer pressure 
 and in some cases if it's a long trial the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons
 Uh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I understand 
 you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude uh to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response 
 I think of the movie uh TWELVE ANGRY MEN
 You ever seen that movie
 Uh <> yeah 
 it's exactly that situation where uh 
 it's Henry Fonda 
 and it's eleven to one 
 and he's the one 
 I believe he was opposed to the conviction 
 uh and he held on 
 and
