 Well let's start with you 
 FIVE HEARTBEATS
 who was in that
 Okay
 When was it out
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I saw that one 
 that was pretty good
 Uh that won best picture I think
 And Costner got best director
 Another Kennedy movie huh 
 One comes to mind here 
 and I not sure about the name has Meryl Streep 
 and um what was the name of that 
 Anyway the ba- 
 the premise of the story is that uh uh uh after you die you go to a place called Judgment City
 And um anyway 
 uh I can't remem- 
 the other actor uh 
 Yeah 
 and uh 
 DEFENDING YOUR LIFE
 DEFENDING YOUR LIFE 
 and it's an excellent movie uh 
 it's pretty entertaining uh 
 Let's see 
 what else have I seen lately um
 HOME ALONE
 Okay 
 yeah
 Ye- 
 di- 
 well did you ever see HOME ALONE
 that was a good one too 
 Yeah 
 it's pretty good 
 and um 
 I can't believe I'm just drawing a blank because I've s- 
 Uh-huh
 That kind of reminds me 
 like uh did you ever see this is going way back uh JAGGED EDGE
 that was a good one too 
 yeah
 But uh 
 Yeah 
 that's 
 Oh okay
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I haven't seen a whole lot either 
 but I know I'm drawing a blank on what I've seen
 I know 
 it's obnoxious because you go in there and you spend six bucks a ticket 
 but then you end up spending another six dollars on food
 And a pop you know 
 so it gets pretty 
 Yeah 
 like if I 
 so if I take a date it cost me you know twenty bucks easy
 And uh I don't know
 I was going to say you know you can find certain restaurants that are nice and have good food eat for thirty dollars
 Yeah 
 the problem is you always have to wait until they're out
 So that's what you're uh dealing with
 That's true 
 that is true
 Well 
 I ought to open the paper here because I know I've seen a few that have played 
 But um <> I just can't come up with any names here
 [ haven't haven't ] been to one for a little while 
 but um Did you ever see KINDERGARTEN COP
 That was pretty good
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 But um 
 Oka- 
 Yeah 
 whose in that
 Uh-huh 
 Another one I saw is called the OBJECT OF BEAUTY 
 I don't recommend that as much as uh DEFENDING YOUR LIFE 
 but it was all right kind of funny 
 <> Um but um what else has been on and about
 Yeah
 I'm trying to 
 I wanted to get to the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 
 I hear that 
 Oh did you see that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Yeah 
 I'll probably try to see it in a little while here
 But it's been out for a while
 Have you heard anything on like OUT FOR JUSTICE
 has he had very many other movies out
 Because it's a macho movie
 Speaking of that I think TERMINATOR TWO is supposed to be out
 I don't know 
 I've enjoyed a lot of his movies
 uh they're action filled and a little bit of humor
 and uh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 did you ever see um um SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY
 I haven't heard much lately
 I just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews
 Yeah
 You expect more out of uh Julia Roberts though
 Did you ever see the original F X movie
 Oh okay 
 because I was going to say I always enjoyed that 
 uh I remember that movie
 and uh it was 
 I mean I got in to it 
 and uh they have F X TWO out 
 I don't know if 
 Yeah 
 it was one of those that has a lot of twists in it
 yeah 
 it's uh 
 I can't put it exactly on the lines of the JAGGED EDGE 
 but it you know kind of on that end you know 
 you get these twists 
 and it's usually pretty good 
 but uh 
 What's that
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 That's probably true 
 I 
 just you see the same story lines different characters 
 and um I don't know 
 it's hard to say 
 An 
 and I know I don't 
 you know I don't keep up with it you know 
 But uh I don't try to 
 just for that reason it does cost a lot
 so why go out and see something right away you know 
 you kind of wait 
 and if something gets really good reviews maybe you'd finally go spend the twelve bucks you know to go to it 
 But um you know I haven't been to an opening for oh you know ages Just because
