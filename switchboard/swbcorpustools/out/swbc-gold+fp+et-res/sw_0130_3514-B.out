 Right 
 so uh well uh what kind of vacations do you like
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's great
 Uh-huh
 Uh no actually
 Why have you 
 Oh okay 
 No uh 
 I have been to Europe once and to Haiti and uh 
 Yeah
 No 
 no 
 Haiti
 Right
 uh well it's in the Caribbean 
 and it's the western half of an island 
 with the eastern half that's the Dominican Republic
 And I was down there with a program from the college that I went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country most of them third world countries And study the language and then do a little service project
 So yeah 
 that turned out to be a really good experience for me
 Uh well see I went there when I was in high school actually
 and I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and uh hung out with them worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp
 Uh uh uh well not that much 
 Just uh 
 Right 
 I mean I wasn't a great asset to them or anything 
 But I you know drove a tractor helped them weed beets and that sort of thing
 And uh yep 
 and I went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home 
 and that was pretty interesting 
 And while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who were uh staying for their vacation in France in Nantes which is on the west coast like right across from England
 Uh so uh where in France are you
 Right 
 Paris
 And uh um how long do you plan to be going for
 Uh-huh
 Great 
 And uh 
 A what
 Oh great
 And uh what else are you planning to do if anything
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah um
 Uh actually no 
 I don't think I went to any of them 
 Uh the closest thing I did was go to some like uh restored castles and stuff
 there is some on that west coast of France 
 and I went to a vineyard or two in Germany
 Yeah 
 that was nice 
 Uh um so uh 
 Uh no

 Okay 
 Well uh well
