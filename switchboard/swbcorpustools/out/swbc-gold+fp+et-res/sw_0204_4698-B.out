 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well I'm currently in school 
 so I've had an I B M clone I guess for a couple of years now which I've been trying continually upgrading I guess 
 And uh I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it 
 and I can't really 
 I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer uh simulation or analysis 
 so 
 it's very essential for me 
 Schools have them 
 uh but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school 
 it's much more convenient to have one at home
 At Georgia Tech
 Yeah 
 so 
 Yes actually
 Yeah 
 it uh 
 Um sure 
 I have some games of course which I play on there 
 and uh uh I have a program which allows me to access a uh weather data bank 
 so I can like check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby 
 So it provides other means other than just strict uh you know computations and so on 
 so do you have a computer for yourself at home
 Oh yeah 
 Yeah 
 Tha- 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Do you use Email and like that
 Yeah 
 It's 
 uh I have modem night computer 
 so I can log into the uh network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which can be useful 
 But uh yeah 
 that and word processing is 
 while I tend to 
 I mean obviously I do almost all of my report writing on my computer uh whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments
 So it's I don't know really become my mainstay I guess 
 I can't even remember 
 actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report Because my family when I was growing up we got a basic computer T R S Eighty when they first came out
 And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high 
 so 
 Oh yeah
 Oh
 Yeah 
 It must have been tough 
 It's a little bit strange for me 
 I did my Master's thesis uh last year 
 and I did that on a computer 
 and it seems like 
 I just can't imagine how people did it before 
 It must have been just so much work 
 Yeah 
 uh so you used your son's Macintosh then 
 do you like that kind of computer
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge
