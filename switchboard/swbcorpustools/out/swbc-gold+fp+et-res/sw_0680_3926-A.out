 That's it
 What do you think are possible changes in the uh way trials are conducted these days 
 Do you like the way some people in there for instance really take over and uh we have no way uh of knowing whether they are legitimately right or wrong and so forth
 What do you think about these things
 so you're saying you think the judge should actually have the final say
 Huh
 Yes 
 I know what you mean
 Well I hadn't uh thought of it from that point of view before 
 I have been in a fairly important trial 
 and uh what bothers me is I was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and uh accurate decision 
 That's the part that bothered me about it 
 Um I really think that the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they are guilty or not 
 But I also think that the jury should be uh more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accurate decisions
 I hate to see people brought in who basically have lived out in the country and don't know much about any of this stuff 
 and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time
 That's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem
 That would be certainly nice 
 let's say 
 we would have fifty percent of them law students anyway Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 That's a very neat idea 
 and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial
 That would be a really good thing to do
 So it's 
 Huh 
 Huh
 For goodness sakes
 Uh-huh
 Oh they saw the husband get 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 They would find something wrong with it
 Did they really 
 Uh-huh
 That is a shame 
 You'd think there would be enough uh people who saw the accident other than his wife to also uh make statements 
 and they have nothing to gain one way or the other 
 So if they say a certain way then why not believe them
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
