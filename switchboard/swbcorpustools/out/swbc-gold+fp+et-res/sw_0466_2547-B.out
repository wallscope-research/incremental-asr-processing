 Well my home at the moment is an apartment
 Yeah 
 I work here in Germantown 
 but I live in Pensacola Florida
 So I own a home in Pensacola 
 and uh let's see 
 we are to compare homes Correct
 Uh my home well is typical for the area 
 I live in a development {F uh 
 } it's a relatively I would say well 
 God it sounds like I'm bragging 
 But it's upper middle class uh kind of an environment 
 It's a two story colonial which my wife and I designed
 Uh it has around thirty-two hundred square feet Uh five bedrooms and so forth and so on 
 and I would imagine in terms of size and so forth it's relatively typical for the area 
 It might be 
 I would say it's probably midsized for the area 
 There are some smaller 
 and there are you know several larger
 uh but based you know in terms of you know in that area of Florida uh it's what now 
 it is uh probably ten years old 
 Yeah
 And so it's 
 in terms of cost and size and so forth it uh 
 the you know housing there is extremely affordable uh compared to other parts of the country you know 
 let's say compared to Maryland that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars 
 but 
 I really haven't uh 
 when we built it ten years ago it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars
 So I haven't really priced you know in the market
 so I 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I thought that was on the upswing again now
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 Well Pensacola has 
 it's really is a buyer's market there now 
 And it isn't because of the well 
 there has been a lot of speculative building Uh I don't know perhaps not in Dallas 
 but uh I'm sure people uh you know in uh Galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it uh 
 Pensacola is a Navy town
 And home porting was a possibility a few years ago
 They were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy
 a new carrier was coming in and uh the uh attendant uh support vessels 
 Well that's no longer the case
 Oh it is 
 I mean the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population
 And so i- 
 overbuilding has been a real problem there
 So you can still get a good house for a very very reasonable price 
 And I mean good I would 
 let's say typical say three bedroom uh two and a half baths on a half acre or so of land uh <> reasonable construction would probably run you uh right now somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars And probably perhaps cheaper depending upon the neighborhood
 What about your home
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Nor do we 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious And in the entire D C area 
 [ I'm I'm ] only about uh twelve miles or so from the uh border of Washington D C and Montgomery County 
 Maryland is probably one of the most expensive places to 
 No 
 we are west
 Sevren is east near the eastern shore
 if I had 
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's not unusual yeah
 Well that area over there is not as expensive as in the immediate you know Washington area
 And so uh I was just looking 
 for example there is a uh condominium complex next to the apartment complex where I live 
 and I was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium 
 And ninety-two thousand dollars for a two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment 
 Now it was very nicely done
 I would have thought 
 Yes 
 I can't envision spending that much money on something along those lines
 So you know it's 
 I guess you pay the piper 
 Plus the taxes around here are phenomenally high 
 Uh for the 
 and so you on that 
 it's not unusual for example for somewhere around here on a 
 you know what you described as your house and what I would describe as my house 
 say for example in Pensacola Florida on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes you know maybe a little bit higher than that now 
 but that same house here you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year taxes on it
 So it's uh so the question of whether to buy here or move to another county say drive twenty more miles north buy a condominium for approximately uh the same price maybe a little lower 
 but the taxes would be you know perhaps maybe one-third uh of 
 Oh absolutely Yeah 
 so 
 it's really sad 
 this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country
 Well they do have an extremely good such things as extremely good school systems for example 
 It has one of the best school systems in the country
 Uh because the cost of living around here is so high
 public employees make great salaries around here 
 I was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the Montgomery County Public Schools makes 
 and I'm not 
 this is uh the figure 
 he makes eighty thousand dollars a year
 That's 
 and I 
 by administrator I think I mean 
 they did not define it 
 but for example a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone you know uh in that range
