 I think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country 
 Now I think we made a major wrong turn when we went uh to the current generation of space craft the reusable ones like they are now because they have not proven as reliable as they should have 
 and I think some of the earlier approaches were uh much better in many ways 
 However uh you know we've gained an awful lot from the space program all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to uh some new space age materials plastics and all that 
 So I think it's been a good investment 
 Uh somebody was telling me the return was about twenty-five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent which is amazing for any governmental financed program 
 I wish the post office would just stop raising our rates
 I think though now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and uh oh I don't know the guilt that we had out of uh Challenger 
 I think maybe we can pick up and go on now 
 But I don't know 
 I don't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives
 The space station's where we should go at this point
 Well where do you think we ought to go with it
 You talking about uh uh a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there
 Well 
 Well I think about half the nations now are military related are they not
 And uh It seems like that high a percentage
 Well it can't afford to 
 No 
 we were talking about that this weekend 
 it's only going to be there a couple of more weeks 
 We need to go
 Have they
 Oh yes
 Well maybe I need to run out there this weekend
 Now do you have to have tickets ahead 
 Excuse me 
 Um I think both of my kids are too old for that
 they're both uh 
 Yes 
 yes 
 Did you 
 It's very impressive I'm sure
 Uh-huh
 Well see that's something else 
 The Russians have had manned space stations for years now 
 You know they had the Merv 
 and see we've yet to keep anyone up over a week or ten days
