 No 
 I don't think there is any such thing as a crime free zone any longer
 Uh one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought oh well something's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams 
 and the next thing I know there are policemen all around my house
 And they had stopped a stolen car and caught one of the men in the hedge 
 and then the other one was on the roof in the back
 on my house 
 So I'm very much aware of uh crime in the cities and the concern about it
 It was
 uh I kept hearing noises 
 and so I knew that I was not going to sleep until I got up and went out and checked the garage

 That kind 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well yes 
 and I work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System
 And uh uh 
 Uh do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are
 Uh no 
 this is over near Lincoln High School Uh not far off South Central Expressway
 It is a pretty rough area 
 We're over by Fair Park

 And the kids see that 
 and uh they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day uh you know running for uh drug dealers if

 and uh I manage the
