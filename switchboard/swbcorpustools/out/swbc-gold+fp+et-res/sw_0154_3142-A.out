 Okay 
 well I guess I enjoy eating out um uh here and there 
 or it's a good change from cooking and eating at home 
 and I guess I like a variety of restaurants
 Uh sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal 
 and sometimes I enjoy going out having a formal meal
 And uh sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad
 Something you know 
 Well a variety 
 I like to go sometimes without them 
 and sometimes it's okay to take them along 
 So 
 Sometimes I think we pay the baby-sitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches 
 so uh you know it just varies 
 we do a mix 
 Sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband 
 and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was just to you know have a moment of peace and quiet without little ones at the table
 So uh I guess actually there are times I even say oh please don't sit us next to a table with other children
 this is our night out 
 but uh anyway where do you like to eat
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Oh which one do you like
 Oh okay 
 Well it's been a long time since we've been in there 
 uh but it's good 
 There's an Italian restaurant over by uh Plano Parkway there 
 pas- <> 
 Oh is it Campari's or something
 Well it's good 
 my husband had been in there several times 
 and actually we went in there for lunch one day
 And uh their pastas were great
 You're brave 
 Oh God 
 Right
 No 
 I don't think so 
 Oh well Even though traditional it can backfire
 Uh well my husband's he's the ethnic fan 
 So he's 
 I don't know 
 You know what we read the uh D MAGAZINE
 we check that and uh the Friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there 
 They often do ratings of restaurants 
 so 
 uh we often save those and ventured out on from there uh just for something that had a high rating
 Okay
 That's right
 Oh good 
 Oh good 
 Oh Oh yeah 
 we use the coupons too 
 That's true 
 That's true
 Oh right 
 Right
 Well I think that's ex- 
 sometimes I think going out to eat it's sort of a recreation
 So uh just a change of pace from uh eating at home 
 So uh anyway I guess uh as far as service when we go out gosh it's nice to have someone come and wait the table And clear the table and 
 Yeah 
 and do the dishes 
 And uh actually it's kind of nice to you know 
 I always 
 uh a waitress or waiter that waits the table it's nice that they're attentive
 but it's not nice when they're too attentive
 So uh we've had experience with that too 
 So 
 Oh yeah 
 Well how we 
 it may help their tip may not huh
 Gosh I guess just in Plano I like to go to Souper Salads
 Uh Chili's is always fine
 I guess if we go into Dallas we like uh the is it Routh Street Cafe
 well you would like it
 You'd like it especially it you're adventuresome
 we've taken people there several times 
 and uh they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding 
 I guess it's whether you call it Southwestern 
 but uh oh we had venison chili one time Which was absolutely wonderful 
 And then I guess it must be seasonal 
 and we've been back 
 oh I guess it's in the winter season 
 well they've never had it when we've been back 
 But uh well you ought to try that 
 it's very good 
 No 
 Oh that's good 
 Yes 
 I've been there
