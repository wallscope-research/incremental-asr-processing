 Yeah 
 they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago
 Oh right 
 Indianapolis got that didn't they
 Yeah
 Well it seems like a big politics game 
 like up here last year the governor was up for re-election 
 so he said the budget was fine 
 the state didn't have any money 
 and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money 
 so they raised all our taxes
 And now it's election time again 
 so they're trying to lower them
 So they're just talk about lowering them 
 but they never do 
 they just keep raising them
 Yeah 
 me neither 
 Well actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long 
 so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year 
 and they're going to lower it for next year
 I guess they figure they're going to make up for all they didn't get when they should have had a budget
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 they say they're going to lower 
 but I'll see
 Yeah 
 so do I 
 I mean I'm middle class barely 
 but uh I don't think the rich are paying not enough 
 I think they're paying too much
 Yeah 
 I mean if you're in the three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month well that's ridiculous 
 Why bother working
 Well they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make
 That would be fair
 Yeah
 no loopholes or anything 
 Everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever
 Right
 Yeah 
 that's the way our state tax is here 
 I think it's pretty fair
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 Oh great 
 so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I guess you have to check yes 
 or you come down to the end of the year 
 and you don't have it to give it to them
 Yeah
 Really
 Ouch 
 Yeah 
 I'll say 
 Y- 
 is
