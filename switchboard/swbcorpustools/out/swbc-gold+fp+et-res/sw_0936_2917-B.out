 Oh 
 Well my husband and I have gotten into some problems with credit cards 
 We don't handle them very well 
 we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more
 they're really bad for us 
 Um matter of fact we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa
 and we pretty much keep those maxed out
 Yeah 
 I had probably twenty credit cards for 
 I had an American Express American Express Gold an Optima all the different department stores um two Visas two MasterCards 
 I mean I had 
 any time anybody would you know send me an application you know preapproved or whatever I took it 
 and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble
 Um because see the more credit cards you have the more people offer them to you
 And the more you use them the more they send them to you
 Exactly 
 The American Express was probably the worst um because with the Gold card 
 I can't remember how much it was because I didn't even have it very long before I gave it up
 but I know the Green card was like thirty-five forty- five dollars a year
 Which was a lot 
 because I mean you had to pay it in full every month
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I had a Discover 
 and that was one of the ones in the group that I ended up um closing 
 Um it really wasn't my choice though 
 I mean I ended up actually losing my credit cards
 Um I ended up going through a credit counseling service um because my husband and I just don't handle credit very well
 and um once you start with their service they close your accounts out
 So I'm still paying on all these accounts 
 but my accounts are closed
 and I would prefer to keep it that way 
 once we're paid off um I would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa 
 and that's it
 I think that's a really good way to handle it because that way if you paid off every month you never have to worry about well how much do I have to pay these guys you know this month you know 
 you buy what you can afford 
 I mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash it's a lot easier to keep it in check
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and I think at this point in time with the economy the way it is I think that um it's going to get even worse 
 Um I'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off now um you know 
 only we started this last year
 and we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole 
 But I think they way the whole economy is going right now it's just not good to be in debt
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle and if you really get into the mind set I got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul 
 and it was scary because I was so good at it
 And I thought this is not right 
 I mean this has got to stop because eventually it'd end up catching up with me 
 and it hit me in the face
 Um
 [ I + yeah 
 I ] have 
 I've learned a lot from it
 I've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand and my husband's too because he's the same way I am
 I don't think that 
 well when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending until the bill comes in
 And then all of a sudden you look at the bill 
 and you go Oh my gosh 
 I spent this much
 Yeah 
 we pretty much use them for emergency type things like transmission fell out on our car
 and that paid for a new transmission
 um and things like that 
 Um and we try not to use them for incidental type things like you know gas and stuff like that
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I've gotten a lot more away from credit cards 
 and I pay by check a lot more now
 I admire you for having that mind set for [ not + not even getting you know past the thirty days 
 that's ideally where I would like to be
 Uh-huh
 I can imagine
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Think about what you can buy for sixty dollars
 Yeah 
 yeah
 I think about all the money that we've spent on interest on all of our credit cards 
 and it's just incredible
 We've never been able to take it off our income tax 
 I'm fairly newly married 
 I've only been married less than two years
 and before that I never owned a home or anything 
 so I never had any deductions
 So really it was always just money thrown away
 And I never really thought about it because 
 Yeah 
 I was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never um became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem
 Yeah 
 most people don't like to talk about money 
 They feel uncomfortable I think
 You know for a lot of people it is very personal
 Yeah
 But I think the average American is probably pretty heavily in debt not including like a mortgage 
 A mortgage is an understandable debt because you have to have a roof over your head
 And I would much rather own my own home than be renting it like we're doing 
 I mean we're basically you know kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away
 We're renting a house
 But you know right now with the way our credit card situation is there's nobody in the world that's going to give us a mortgage on a house
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's going to take quite a while
 Hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home
 But um I'm not really counting on it real soon
