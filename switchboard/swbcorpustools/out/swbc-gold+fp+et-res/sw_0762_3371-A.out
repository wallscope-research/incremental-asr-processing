 So what kind of a house do you live in
 Uh-huh 
 Well our home is uh for our area it's probably one of the lower income homes out here 
 Uh most of the homes that they're building 
 well I shouldn't say all of them 
 but most of them now are up in the millions of dollars
 Oh yeah 
 there's 
 We have got about uh I'd say about twenty-four hundred
 Uh we've got five bedrooms because we built onto our garage
 a bedroom for my mother 
 and uh 
 Oh
 Oh that's great
 Well this house is very comfortable 
 We've got two living areas 
 and that's the thing I probably like the most about it
 It's just one story 
 Yeah 
 It's a Fox and Jacobs home
 Um we've been real happy with it
 Of course I'm not a carpenter or anything like that 
 They could probably come in and say gee this is not straight 
 and this is under something 
 but 
 No
 No 
 we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all
 No
 We've been real lucky 
 So 
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 I've heard a lot of people say that 
 That's for sure 
 Uh we have an attic that we've just put you know plywood over the beams and things up in the attic 
 and so that has replaced it to some extent 
 but certainly not 
 Uh in parts 
 I mean you really couldn't use it for a room
 Yes
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 uh we've got you know 
 I'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there
 Two living areas 
 We have a living room and dining room at the front of the house
 and then we have the uh family room kitchen and playroom at the rear of the house which has been really nice 
 In fact I really enjoy the playroom 
 you would think that would not be a real bonus you know to a house
 but of all the rooms in the house I'd say that was the one that's been really nice to have 
 I think that's true
 Yeah 
 Probably our family room is the biggest Uh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is
 but it is nice to have it because uh with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment
 So 
 Seventeen years
 Uh-huh
 Oh wow
 Oh uh-huh
 Yes 
 it is
 Uh-huh
 Well that's interesting
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well my husband wouldn't do that anyway 
 that's his 
 worst thing in life is to have to repair something
 So 
 Well uh that's great 
 We just kind of save everything uh for when his Dad comes to visit 
 and then he does all the repairing you know 
 he does
