 well I like to cook foods I like to eat 
 I like to eat Italian food best
 And I find that that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals type things and they're kind of convenient
 Right
 Um I usually have parties that are smaller groups 
 I've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like Thanksgiving and such
 And so um yeah 
 I guess I usually do 
 I like to cook um heavy sauces and um noodles and pasta and such
 Yeah 
 actually 
 How about you 
 what do you like to cook
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Humidity or something
 Uh-huh
 It uh kind of down played compared to what you would like huh
 Do you find yourself um with all the um cholesterol and high fiber changing the way that you entertain 
 Uh-huh
 Oh no
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 That sounds good
 Well every once in a while I think I feel the same way 
 When I'm entertaining I don't take that thing into consideration unless it's really really 
 like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories 
 so I think dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play sometimes
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Oh that's good
 Uh-huh
 Um nothing comes to mind right off 
 so I guess not
 Okay 
 you too
 Bye bye
