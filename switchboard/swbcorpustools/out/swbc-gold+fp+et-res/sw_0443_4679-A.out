 Why don't you go ahead and start
 So you think if trials were held by judges or experts that they would tend not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
 You know I attended a trial in uh Germany when I was a student 
 and uh that's the sort of system they have 
 The trials are held by a panel of uh three or four judges who are well 
 they're like lawyers I guess 
 They're experts in the law
 and uh there really isn't a jury 
 and uh uh they do the questioning also 
 The judges do the questioning 
 and uh they 
 uh i- 
 I think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because uh uh the judge is also sort of a jury uh 
 but I'm not sure I like that 
 I think I prefer the jury system myself 
 Uh well actually I think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury 
 what I worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual 
 That's where you really need a jury of peers Because uh anytime the government uh is the government against the individual you need the protection of ordinary citizens 
 I think that's really the only thing I guess where I would like to see the system change is uh uh there ought to be a well 
 I guess I don't think that uh uh juries need to decide sentencing all the time
 I think maybe a judge is a better judge of that 
 or uh 
 Yeah
 Well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent 
 That's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe
 But people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see I think that is maybe uh a little bit naive
 In Texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people
 Uh it's kind of uh uh a hanging jury atmosphere 
 But in a lot of places I think people bend over the other way 
 but I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it 
 some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that
 I kind of like that system 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 And lawyers blow sand in their eyes
 I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries
 Insurance cases and things like that
 Where 
 and uh there would be more honest settlements instead of this uh tugging of people's heart strings and uh making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering 
 So I think in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government 
 but
