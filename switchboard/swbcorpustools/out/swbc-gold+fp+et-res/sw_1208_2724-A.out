 Uh s- 
 I uh weight train uh three days on and one day off
 I uh ride bicycles uh fifteen twenty miles I don't know maybe three times maybe four times a week 
 I play basketball uh couple times a week 
 I play softball one night a week 
 Uh that's what I do
 What about yourself
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Yeah 
 uh what do you ride uh like a bunch of hills or pretty flat
 How long does that take you to get to work
 how does that work out with uh storing your bike and showering and all that
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 Do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there
 Uh-huh
 Uh well actually my wife just got me into it 
 and I did an internship at the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas the Cooper Clinic 
 and I learned all the health benefits of you know 
 I was a solid weight trainer
 and all I did was weights and aerobic exercise 
 and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it 
 so once I got into this uh internship I learned all the physiological advantages to it 
 so I began a program I don't know probably three or four weeks ago 
 and I did my first bike rally this Saturday 
 I did uh forty miles
 and uh that's the longest I've ever ridden so far 
 I usually you know fifteen or twenty
 And it was kind of hilly 
 and it was pretty tough 
 but uh I'm looking at uh doing a lot more of it because you know my wife is really into it
 and I kind of held her back a little bit this weekend 
 She wanted to go go go 
 but you know she wanted to stay with me 
 Yeah 
 it really is
 Yeah 
 that would be cool sometime if I could you know work up to that
 Oh
 I've never really looked into that 
 you know that's 
 my wife would just love that
 And I may do that sometime 
 There again I'm just kind of a fledgling into this
 it's kind of funny 
 I called this number 
 and I was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up
 I mean around Texas you got about five or six 
 if you live around the Dallas area you got five or six every weekend to choose from Because they're really into it
 Bicycling is really big here 
 I didn't know that you know until I came down here and kind of caught the fever
 Because I lived in Indiana all my life 
 and you know you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle or above the age of fifteen or something
 but other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here
 Probably
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 there's a lot of bikers around here 
 it's really neat
 There are a lot of resources a lot of magazines and stuff 
 little TEXAS BICYCLIST is like a little newspaper that comes out every month
 It's free 
 just go to the bike shop and pick it up 
 and it's got all the rides coming up 
 so I guess I'm going to be busy about every Saturday this summer going to a different ride 
 Yeah 
 see a little bit of Texas I've never seen before
 So uh how long have you been biking
 Yeah
 Have uh it's kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had uh a blood workup done recently or since you've been biking to see if it 
 because from what I understand it really improves your uh cholesterol
 and you know uh it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is uh uh low cardiovascular fitness and also uh you know the cholesterol
 It gives you increased H D Ls and decreases your L D Ls
 Yeah 
 so 
 Yeah
 Really
 That's good
 You say you ride about a hundred hundred fifty miles a week
 Man 
 that's hard-core
 When do you get to begin with the winters and all that 
 What time of the year do you usually embark on your 
 do you ride inside if you can't ride outside
 Yeah
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 So you uh change up your routes a lot and keep a 
 So what school is it
 Oh okay 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 Sounds neat
 It's kind of 
 I was wondering if I was going to talk with someone that never has exercised before and doesn't want to and everything else 
 but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week 
 That's uh motivating
 That's really good 
 Well good talking to you 
 and keep up the good work
 All right 
 Take care
 Bye
