 Well Steve did you go to college
 Oh that's good 
 So you probably could give some great advice
 Uh-huh
 Well what's your interest 
 your uh 
 Uh-huh
 that's similar to what 
 I'm in a P H D program right now
 And uh my area of expertise it's information systems which is a little bit less technical I think uh than computer science 
 But my area of expertise is uh uh human computer interaction
 And I think that's one reason why I'm part of this study uh because I'm working with voice systems
 Yeah 
 so good luck 
 I guess we should talk about giving advice though 
 what type of advice do you think you'd give to a parent
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think that's more important probably than even the career vocation because most people change
 I know very few people that uh started in one field and stayed with it 
 You know they 
 I think that's what you just said you know having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school uh 
 I think that's much more important 
 I'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs you know 
 that uh some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer 
 but some of some of the larger small schools you know I guess around three or four thousand students can offer a broader range of curriculums and things 
 so if the kid does change they don't have to transfer 
 or they don't have to uh uh 
 I don't know they don't have to give up years you know of credit transfer and things
 Yeah
 I normally 
 and parents hate to hear this you know 
 because I actually teach college 
 uh I hate to talk to the parents 
 um one of the reasons is because you know the kid doesn't know exactly what they want 
 and I always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not going to be your career vocation because you'll get better grades 
 I think most employers would probably rather hire you know a three six um in history uh to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration
 Does that make sense
 Yeah 
 I always you know tell them that you should major in something you're going to get good grades in Because that's always I think more important you know overall 
 I don't know
 Yeah 
 Oh you're at the office now
 At work 
 Yeah
 it would 
 I tell you 
 I live in Maryland 
 and the public schools here are pretty good 
 I teach at a public school actually 
 and I know that the S A T scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the private schools 
 And um I would full time at a public school 
 and then right now I'm teaching part time at a Catholic institution 
 um and I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school because I think their parents pay more 
 and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated 
 where at the public school I don't think as many parents are college educated 
 and I think because it costs less the kid doesn't take it quite as serious you know 
 th- 
 it's the minimal cost 
 But I think you can get a good education at public or private 
 but I think you can also get a bad education at public or private you know 
 I 
 you have to look around at the school 
 I think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 does it have a big ten football team 
 or 
 Yeah 
 I mean uh yeah 
 is it a PAC ten school you know
 But I think 
 yeah 
 see I'm at the University of Maryland so in this region um though I go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland my diploma will still say University of Maryland
 Um you know it doesn't differentiate on my diploma though I would put it on my resume what program I went to 
 But I think you know I'm actually at a smaller program 
 I'm not at the big College Park campus you know 
 that's the big one with the football team
 So um I think you're right that there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition 
 Um you know when I first was applying for graduate schools I applied to some big programs you know in this area like Stevens Institute of Technology which is recognized in the Northeast as you know one step below M I T in a sense you know 
 so it's got big name recognition in this area a big science school no football team but a big science school
 and technical people know that 
 But I don- 
 yeah 
 I think you're right 
 you really have to think about that for the job 
 I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor's 
 and when I 
 now I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs 
 I was going to be a teacher 
 I was just a high school teacher 
 so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of
 you know but then when I went um for graduate work you know or for a new job people said to me you know Shippensburg State where is that you know 
 And you know when I went into higher education even at other universities they weren't aware of it you know
 So I think yeah 
 that's important 
 um I think it depends on if you want a regional job or a national job 
 you need that first job or so out of school too
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 depending on your technical areas 
 Yeah
 I could see that 
 But you know I know that at University of Maryland where I am you know in a P H D program I haven't even met uh someone outside of my area of information systems except for
