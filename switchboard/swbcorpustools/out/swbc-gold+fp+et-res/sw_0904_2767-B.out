 Hi Judy 
 This is Norma 
 and I live in Virginia 
 We got a great topic 
 I guess we might as well 
 Okay
 Let you start 
 What changes uh
 I guess the biggest 
 I don't know your age Judy 
 but uh in my lifetime the biggest is in more women working definitely 
 Yeah
 well yeah
 Right 
 I don't see them in positions of power in corporation either 
 not many
 I did work in government
 And before that I worked in a bank for eight years
 And now I'm retired
 That's right
 Which do you work in excuse me
 A government
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 In teaching
 But not at the college level
 We live in a college town 
 and I worked at the university for a while
 And there are woman there 
 but they're not the high paid professors that the men are 
 Well they did have one woman dean 
 and I guess she probably did very well 
 but that's the minority
 None of the above 
 I think they are extremely well qualified
 Uh I don't know how 
 I think they're not selected
 And of course at this university uh 
 it's a big engineering school 
 and I don't think there are many women in the engineering college
 And that's where the high pay is
 Quite an 
 well I think there are more than there used to be
 But they may not go into teaching
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Well I met one one day that uh had just joined the faculty in agricultural engineering 
 and that really surprised me
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 I don't know 
 I don't know how many go on and get a P H D in engineering
 That could be 
 That's true
 Uh-huh 
 That's right
 Oh 
 That's interesting 
 uh was she the major wage earner
 I mean did she earn more money that he did 
 or you know 
 Oh uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh I know one uh gal 
 she's a C P A 
 and her husband is a house husband
 And then they had a child 
 and he was still the house husband 
 He wasn't going to 
 Uh-huh 
 Even before that 
 right
 She was a little perturbed about it
 At one time
 she's moved away I don't know how it is now 
 but I know uh we all went out one evening 
 and uh there was an underlying note she was perturbed about it
 Uh-huh
 I don't think there was a valid reason 
 Because her statement was I told him let's face it 
 you're a house husband 
 that's what you'll always be
 She wouldn't have be 
 that's right 
 Uh-huh 
 that's right
 it wouldn't have been a doubter 
 Uh-huh 
 That's true
 Huh-uh 
 Oh
 That's right 
 I think maybe more men would like to be if they weren't put down so badly 
 Huh-uh 
 No 
 I didn't 
 How do you feel your career has gone
 You don't 
 That's good
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 I was discriminated against very definitely in banking
 It was terrible
 Right 
 And the money didn't go with the positions
 The promotions came 
 but there comparable pay for the responsibility
 And I was told you don't need as much pay as I have because your children are older than my children 
 or your husband has a good job 
 and 
 I thi- 
 uh-huh 
 I think we uh are programmed to just take it as it comes
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 I don't
