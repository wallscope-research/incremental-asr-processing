 Okay
 Well I think it's probably a combination of things 
 Um factories that burn coal as an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants you know 
 and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides
 Uh those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain 
 and I think that's probably hurting us a little bit 
 you know it's hurting Germany for example too and some other parts of Europe where they have high industry 
 So we're not the lone ranger here
 Yeah
 Hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit 
 but I know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Huh 
 Yeah 
 I guess I missed that one 
 Uh
 Automobiles of course are contributing too 
 and you know how we are with our love affair with the auto
 kind of hard to do anything about that I guess
 Yeah
 We have that here too 
 but it's part of the inspection sticker you know 
 they put a probe in your exhaust pipe 
 and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out 
 and so you know that's the way they're dealing with it here
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It'd probably be difficult anyway
 I was just reading an article in uh MOTHER EARTH NEWS magazine
 and uh they've got a new uh 
 you know a lot of places are burning wood
 a lot of people are burning wood 
 those of us who have 
 I've got a place in the country you know
 and uh they've had you know catalytic converters on those on 
 uh I think they're required in California and Oregon and Washington 
 but they've had up those for quite a while 
 and somebody's come up with a new one that uh sort of 
 it's a catalytic converter 
 it's a plate that fits you know into the smoke pipe
 and uh apparently it sort of feeds itself 
 The more smoke is produced you know 
 after you get to like five hundred degrees the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is 
 And it sounds real neat 
 I haven't seen them priced anywhere yet 
 but that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on you know uh older stoves that don't have any kind of E P A requirements on them 
 That might help a little bit especially in some places 
 We're really lucky here 
 We have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out
 Now sometimes we get a kind of a 
 especially in uh autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us 
 but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well
 Probably blowing up there to you guys 
 Yeah
 It comes back
 Yeah 
 I really think uh you know we're doing some important things 
 Education raising consciousness awareness 
 uh I know school kids 
 I work for the school district here 
 and uh you know this is one of the big things with kids 
 Kids are writing letters to the newspapers you know telling adults to clean up their act 
 and it's uh you know 
 I hope we're not too late with it 
 uh we're having all kinds of recycling
