 Well basically I think it would be a good idea myself 
 uh I think if somebody's not on drugs they have no reason you know to be afraid of it
 Uh I do think that there has to be some controls uh 
 like I don't think one test positive should uh be uh <> the end of it you know
 I think they should test more than once
 It 
 Uh-huh 
 That's right
 <> Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 There's so many jobs that uh really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life 
 you know and it's uh 
 uh how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it
 You know and I think there definitely needs to be some control to it 
 I guess it is possible to have a false positive report
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Or somebody's test gets mixed up with somebody else's
 I mean those things do happen
 Uh I certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined uh wrongly 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do that uh doesn't require the testing
 Uh to me it's not an invasion or privacy 
 I think people have a right to know if uh their life maybe's in jeopardy [ or + uh Yeah 
 the work they're doing for their company 
 Uh those things are all affected 
 If not immediately it certainly does eventually
 I think that's where a lot of the problem is at first 
 It doesn't seem to uh bother the quality of work
 but eventually it does
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Course I feel the same way on the AIDS problem 
 I don't think that's an invasion of privacy 
 that's the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for you know 
 and it's destroying a lot of people's lives 
 Yeah 
 and it's destroying people's lives 
 and I think that person plus anybody in danger should know about it and be aware of it
 I don't know 
 it's kind of hard to <> 
 I guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that uh an invasion of privacy 
 Of course that's not supposed to be what we're talking about today I guess 
 So I kind of get off on a tangent here 
 Uh do you work for uh Texas Instruments
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Oh that's probably why 
 my brother did live in Grapevine Texas 
 That's near Dallas
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 It's pretty hot down there probably
 Yeah 
 Oh did you really 
 Oh that's great 
 Uh-huh 
 we need rain real bad up here
 uh everything's really getting dry 
 It's uh 
 Yeah 
 It's kind of at a dangerous level here 
 People hauling water 
 and uh it's getting real bad
 So 
 So 
 Um <> So do I 
 Uh I can't think of anything else uh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh I can understand 
 I know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them I can see them objecting You know
 there's a lot of people that think that there's nothing wrong with <> 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Oh I'll be darn
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 the different cultures and that too uh 
 No 
 no 
 I'm sure it would have to affect you the same way 
 I can't think that would make any difference whether it was legal or not
 it would still have to affect you the same way
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 you go by their laws
 The same way our people have to go by their laws when they're over there 
 That's why a lot get in trouble because they have to follow their rules 
 and uh some of the countries are very much against drugs 
 and you use them you <> pay for it 
 Yeah 
 a lot of them 
 Yeah 
 where is it if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger 
 Is that where it is
 I thought wow 
 You know that's quite a deterrent 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 So I guess you know we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about <> how great out country really is
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 they abuse it is what they do
 Yeah
 Yeah
 So
