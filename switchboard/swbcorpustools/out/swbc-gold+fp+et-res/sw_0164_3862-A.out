 Hello
 Hi 
 my name is Dolphene 
 I live in Texas
 Okay 
 I work for T I 
 do you also
 Okay
 Oh okay 
 uh you ready to begin
 Oh okay 
 Okay
 Yes
 Well I don't think that uh any of my relatives would really like to go there 
 I believe if I am in a position uh like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that I will be able to just bring her into my home and my father also uh or have someone go into their home you know uh and look them 
 That way 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 it's more how they feel about it
 And it is like they feel uh the way my mother would put it like somebody had thrown them away You know
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 And another thing to think about uh on the positive side of the nursing homes here 
 I use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home
 and I got to see a lot of the things that they did
 uh they had a lot of crafts 
 and they had a lot of games 
 and uh they get together and they do all sorts of things 
 and then there 
 some of uh the people that are in there are you know very nice and friendly to everybody
 and uh then there are others that are 
 uh it is just a job 
 and they just you know want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home 
 Uh the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well it is like the one that I worked in uh you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day 
 they would just roll themselves around all over the place 
 and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities 
 and then you would see some of the others that were like distant from the other group 
 and they they just didn't like participate together with the others because they had some uh I guess uh slight mental disabilities and things like that
 what do you call Alzheimer <> disease and stuff like that 
 and uh they weren't really together with the rest of them when they got together for such activities
