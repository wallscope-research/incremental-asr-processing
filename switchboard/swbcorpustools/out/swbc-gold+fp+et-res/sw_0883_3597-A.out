 do you see as uh the changes that have occurred in the last 
 Beverly
 Huh 
 yeah 
 that's a big one
 Well I think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible for any of their actions 
 Somebody else uh made them do it 
 Uh that's what I seem to see a lot of that uh no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices 
 It's rather sue these guys because they made uh a seat belt that didn't work right 
 or uh that's what I think is a big one
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Yeah 
 and another thing I think has changed quite a bit is uh the roles that men and women play 
 That's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly
 Well both you know 
 there's some great things that uh have come about with more equality 
 but I think that also 
 I don't know what's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that because I think that's bad for us
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I would agree with you 
 Uh
