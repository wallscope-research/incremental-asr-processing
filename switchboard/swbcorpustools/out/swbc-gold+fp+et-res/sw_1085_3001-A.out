 Okay
 No
 No 
 uh my fianc3e works for the computers for the government 
 and that's how he got it
 I just graduated from college
 No
 Or what I'm looking for
 No 
 huh-uh
 No
 Um 
 Oh yeah 
 I've heard of that 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it can 
 Uh-huh
 Oh I like to think about that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Not always safe 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Oh that's nice
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well um I can just tell you like you know 
 from my dad and my fianc3e like my dad 
 Well there's twelve kids in my family
 So the dental was very important you know to my dad
 But um I think they took the dental away now 
 He worked for United Telephone System 
 you know it's just another you know telephone network
 And they took the dental away 
 but now I think they're going to start getting into eye
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and now for his pension he pretty much just has the stock 
 But my fianc3e he's on that same kind of pension as what you said only for everything he puts in they'll match it up to a certain amount
 Like if he puts in a dollar they'll put in a dollar you know
 And then he's only allowed I think I don't know if it's maybe five percent or something like that that he's allowed to put in 
 and they'll match it
 So and um he works for the 
 did you ever hear of the National Bureau of Standards
 Okay 
 well he works for them 
 They changed their name now 
 but that's where he works 
 and um his vacation is really nice 
 He's going to be there three years at the end of this month 
 and he'll be getting three weeks vacation
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Ok- 
 you know of course it's for the government 
 and he has all the holidays off
 Right 
 right 
 Yeah 
 uh-huh 
 he has it really nice 
 It's nice where he works 
 and um he seems to be very happy you know 
 Like his hospitalization 
 and you know he has all that 
 and with his doctors and stuff they have um a list of doctors that the employees can go to 
 and it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor
 You know and I think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any 
 But you have to go you know to certain ones 
 but still that works out really nice 
 You know it 
 That's not bad either 
 Uh-huh
