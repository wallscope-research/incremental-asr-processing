 Where do you live
 San Antonio
 Well uh I live in Garland 
 and we're just beginning to 
 we just built a real big recycling center that recycles everything imaginable 
 but as far as uh trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing they're testing that 
 So they're really not full force into it 
 but they're trying 
 so we're attempting it 
 but I wish we could do more
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 Huh
 Right 
 that's what I do
 Right 
 when they put centers and stuff like that 
 Yeah 
 well we have those uh which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans 
 I don't know if you all have those things around
 And I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center 
 and you can just stop by 
 Now everything else like the uh paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers 
 but for aluminum that's real nice 
 and I started doing that at work 
 Um I put out a trash can for people to put their aluminum cans in
 and that's really helped a lot 
 I mean everybody's pitched in 
 and you know it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can
 So I really like that 
 but people are really concerned 
 it's just that sometimes it's not the right people which is really sad because I wish we would do more 
 At work we started uh all the recycling stuff 
 They're really trying 
 I think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year
 And uh that really started a lot of stuff off 
 but you know sometimes it dwindles down
 That's good
 Well that's uh 
 at least your trying something
 It's just yeah 
 it would be nice if it could be more
 Oh do you really
 Well that's a neat idea
 Right
 Well that's really good 
 I mean at least they're trying
 Yeah 
 I know a lot of companies that waste so much that 
 I'm even trying 
 you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building 
 and you know the nice cardboard boxes that you move packing boxes *[[slash error]] And they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster 
 and I thought I don't understand this you know
 We're trying to cut cost and everything like that and recycle and all that stuff 
 and here we are wasting 
 And I don't understand sometimes the logic behind it
 Uh-huh
 That's exactly what I did
 Exactly what I did exactly
 Because I didn't want to waste that
 And it's hard enough to find good packing boxes 
 Right
 Exactly right 
 well that's very good 
 Right 
 right
 I found uh about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes that were in the dumpsters 
 Oh gosh 
 so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes when you know these are perfect 
 so 
 Right 
 right 
 right
 Uh-huh 
 right
 That's exactly what I do
 Uh-huh 
 They're good for storage and stuff like that 
 That's what I do with a lot of my daughter's things is I'll store you know like her out dated or out of season clothes in them 
 and they're just perfect
 Uh-huh
 And they look just as good 
 That's a smart idea
 I think I'll have to try that 
 That's really cute
 They're the exact same thing 
 That's all they are 
 they just made them look fancy
 You saved me some money
 And you're recycling 
 Well that's neat 
 Well do you all have uh 
 we have places that uh pay for paper to recycle 
 I know you do yours at work 
 but for newspaper 
 But ours are real hard to find 
 That's the one thing that really discourages me 
 you know I recycle paper 
 but they 
 it's almost like they don't want the paper because they don't pay at all
 I mean they're real hard to find the places that pay 
 And that's really discouraging 
 I mean I just go ahead and take it to the regular place where you know they just accept it
 But uh I think they should 
 yeah 
 if they want people to recycle I think it's uh you know 
 like the aluminum you know 
 it gets people uh doing it you know 
 you don't have to pay them a lot
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's good
 I 
 the one thing I don't like about the newspaper also is uh 
 like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk 
 You have one for paper and one for just your normal trash
 but uh in the paper one you have to separate 
 You have to make sure you don't throw away any of the slick paper like magazines
 You can't throw any of that away 
 and you can't throw certain file type things away 
 and I just think it's such a hassle 
 it seems like it would be easy to take it all 
 I don't know 
 of course I don't know all that about recycling 
 so it probably is a hassle 
 But I do get tired of having to separate paper you know
 Right 
 right 
 And we had uh a write up in our paper uh this last time at work about um 
 they come and empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash 
 and every other day they do your recycling trash
 And somebody was writing in complaining that the people had uh dumped all the trash in the same bin
 And when they were questioned about it they said well we're running late 
 or we didn't have time to do those bins or something 
 and that's real discouraging Thinking you're sitting there working to separate it 
 and then they 
 Right 
 right 
 so they're really trying to start keeping an eye out for those you know 
 talking to the people again about you know 
 separate them 
 because that is discouraging when you do that <> 
 It was hard to get used to those two different trash cans
 But luckily that will all get straightened out 
 and they'll start separating them 
 Because I don't mind doing that 
 I feel like I'm uh doing something for the community when I'm doing that
 But anyway 
 You too
 Bye
