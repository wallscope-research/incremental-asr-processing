 Well I think that uh women working is the one that really affects me most strongly right now 
 Um
 Well women in general and also myself
 But um it used to not really make a difference to me um 
 or at least I didn't think so 
 But my mother worked 
 and I kind of now wish that she hadn't um that she had um stayed home 
 and right now I'm kind of stuck because I'd like to have children 
 but I'm not ready to do that because when I do have children I want to stay home 
 So I'm having to uh try to figure out a way to be able to do that
 And in our society right now that's really something that's um not respected 
 and um it's not easy to do at all 
 I mean there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the wife is going to actually be a mother
 Uh-huh 
 I think that they have to be related
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I think that that's probably true
 I just wish there was a way 
 I know that you know in Sweden what they have there it's really their medical plan but it also deals with this subject because if a woman uh is working and I think even if she's not and has a child the government subsidizes her to stay home and raise the child
 I don't know
 Until it um 
 I'm sure until at least school age and maybe longer
 What this does is it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care to raise the child for her
 And I think that that's a much much more viable solution really
 Oh yeah 
 that's great
 Uh-huh
 Um goodness 
 what else
 Oh there's been so many 
 how do you just 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 really
 I don't see how they could be especially not if they have to pay for child care
 Uh-huh
 You're probably right 
 If she sat down and looked at it she'd be like God what am I doing this for you know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 religion has changed too
 Um uh some people now it seems like are turning back toward actually trying to find out what they're in it for instead of just um 
 it 
 some places still it seems like it's a social club
 You know it's just a place to go to visit uh to wear your nice clothes and to sit around and talk 
 but um I think a lot of people are really you know searching now to find out who they are and who God is and what all that really means now
 Yeah 
 oh um it's beginning I think
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh yes 
 Well I guess that's always happened
 Maybe not as much as now 
 but 
 Okay 
 Nice to talk to you
 Bye-bye
