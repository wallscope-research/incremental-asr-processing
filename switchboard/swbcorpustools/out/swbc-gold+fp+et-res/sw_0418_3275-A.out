 Um I do 
 what do you think about them
 Yeah 
 definitely 
 I have one right now 
 and um I just got it about six months ago
 and I find that it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get 
 Yeah
 Oh my goodness
 Really
 That's good
 D- 
 yeah 
 I made a rule with myself when I got one that if I couldn't pay it in full every month that I'd have to rip it up 
 so 
 That's 
 Yeah 
 but 
 Uh-huh 
 I have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out 
 And they can't do anything but work to try to pay them off 
 and like one of my friends hers is up to nine hundred dollars 
 and she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because she's going to school
 and so I mean that's just enough to pay rent and buy like thirty-five dollars worth of food a month So and pay for her like monthly fee like twen- 
 I guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the 
 so all she's paying is interest on hers every month
 It just seems crazy to me 
 but 
 Yeah
 Oh really
 Was a Visa card
 Oh my goodness
 I bet
 Yeah 
 I don't know 
 I'm about sick of mine right now 
 I don't 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Exactly
 Yeah 
 my parents are really good about not using credit cards 
 They are against it 
 I don't think they like the fact that I have one either
 <> Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Huh
 Yeah 
 I'm twenty right now
 So just going to school and working 
 so 
 it does kind of get in the 
 when you want something that 
 like last weekend was homecoming 
 and I needed a pair of shoes 
 so I just went out and bought them on my credit card 
 I didn't really have the money to do it 
 but 
 Yeah <> 
 It sure is 
 So do you just have two kids 
 or 
 Oh really
 Neat 
 I'm from Plano Texas
 But right now I'm out in Provo Utah going to B Y U 
 so 
 Yep 
 But this is a extra long one
 They're giving us a lot of time 
 Yeah 
 Have you done a lot of this
 Oh really
 Do you do it every day
 Wha-
