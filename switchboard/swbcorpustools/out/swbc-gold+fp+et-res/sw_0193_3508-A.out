 I guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling
 Well lots right
 Finally
 Well we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the uh Boy Scouts our boys have been involved in have uh had a huge recycling bin over at Resurrection Lutheran Church
 uh so we've done that for quite some time 
 but since the price of paper has gone down 
 like it's about a fifth of what it used to be
 so the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the City took it over
 So now we just put ours out for the City of Plano 
 Do you live in Plano
 Okay 
 yeah
 Right
 Yes
 Although just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that uh work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah 
 we used to take ours there
 I know
 Right
 Right 
 I'm really glad they do it 
 Uh yeah 
 I do news mostly newspapers and uh plastic two liter diet Coke bottles And aluminum cans some 
 but I don't use as many of those
 I guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that are really dirty that you have to wash out 
 Uh ha
 Wasting all your time and effort and Putting it in there 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Got your routine down 
 Yeah
 Well I guess there are some places uh in the north in particular that uh have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle 
 because let's see they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight
 So if you recycle things of course then you don't have all that weight in there
 Right
 That's right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Um
 Right
 Yeah 
 right
 Probably going to throw them in your trash 
 Well there are places that take car batteries 
 but I wonder if they would take 
 I mean not that it would 
 kind of a pain to you know drive over somewhere special for two little tiny batteries 
 but 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Right 
 that's true
 Uh when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving and uh the truck came by well we all ran out to watch it because you know we'd never really seen it pick up our stuff 
 and one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he uh scanned across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff 
 and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just you know scanned it 
 so I don't know what that was reading it for
 but uh 
 they must be trying to keep track of you know who is doing it or what I guess
 I don't know 
 Another 
 Ooh for those who are really cooperating
 Now that would encourage it
 Sure
 Sure
 But the garbage uh 
 now there is just one garbage man that comes on the truck instead of two
 So that's interesting 
 Uh also slightly off the subject but our big green garbage thing got stolen
 Uh-huh
 And we called the City 
 and uh they brought us a new one 
 and they did not charge us 
 And they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen
 Isn't that sad You know 
 And just 
 Oh and they must be Yeah really expensive 
 I mean of course we were hoping we weren't going to have to pay for it you know
 but I mean what would somebody do with them
