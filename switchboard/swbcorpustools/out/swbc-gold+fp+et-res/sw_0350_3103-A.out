 Okay
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh mercy
 Yeah 
 that's too bad
 Um um that's sad 
 It really is
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 that's wonderful
 Uh-huh
 Well that's wonderful
 That speaks well of your mother 
 She had high standards
 Yeah
 Oh bless her heart
 Challenges
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh- 
 uh-huh
 Surely
 Well I think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh Nickie 
 And I can uh relate to that uh
 uh I think it's the image that the woman has and uh in the world as uh the lesser of the two
 And uh I think things are changing 
 but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to take 
 And uh I think we are progressing at a snail's pace 
 but we are progressing
 So that's the main point is that we are going ahead
 And uh I think that uh in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve
 And uh men uh a lot of them have uh come around and have seen the error of their ways
 But there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change
 So we have to uh face that reality also
 It could be if they are not sure of themselves
 The one's that uh go along with that they are sure of themselves
 And they know that they can uh you know uh be on the same level
 And they do not have any uh ego uh problems that they are fighting
 And uh I think that we are going to be uh on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term
 Uh and what I would like to see happen futuristically is what we are discussing is that yes uh we each have our uh jobs in life and that we should recognize that And that we should support each other
 And uh I think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other And just looked at each other as equals and none lesser because we are equal
 Uh-huh
 Uh Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well I guess we would have to go back to the way that the Lord made us
 And uh the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands
 And I believe that strongly
 uh but I think that they should be in harmony with what they are with what the subject matter is
 And I think the issue should be settled before there's a conflict
 Uh and I think that can happen in a very wonderful way
 And if we men and women would do as the Bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves
 Can you picture that
 I mean if your husband did that to you and you did that to your husband you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself
 And uh that's really the divine answer and the right answer 
 So uh uh that would be a beautiful relationship
 And I think there are some people that have done that
 and I have seen it
 And it's just marvelous 
 and I am just in awe to see this
