 Hi
 You didn't try rewallpapering 
 You just uh 
 Did you use a textured paint 
 or 
 Um
 Well did you get good results
 <> Yeah
 But it didn't cover it
 Well we did a uh 
 we moved oh last August 
 and we're getting a house 
 my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den 
 and we decided 
 we went to I've forgotten one of the paint stores 
 and they just said oh you can get by 
 and I forgotten what it was you put down and then you can just paint right over the dark
 Well more or less 
 After about uh half dozen coats it looks reasonable 
 but it kept 
 the dark 
 it was uh just a real dark uh wood grain type paneling
 and it was smooth 
 uh and we put this stuff on 
 and it supposedly textured it or did something to it 
 but because of the dark behind it it was really hard to cover 
 and <> 
 Yeah 
 It was something like that although when we got through I wished we hadn't done it 
 because you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it 
 and we were painting it and trying to uh you know make it 
 and it really was you know 
 the advice they give you is uh 
 the job was considerably tougher than we thought
 Uh particularly when you try to 
 I was talking to somebody else who had a lot of wood panelling 
 and uh they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate 
 and it seemed like it was a good sized den with a lot panelling 
 and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something
 have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh that's quite reasonable
 Um problem i- 
 have you tried matching paint lately
 My wife 
 we built a shed over the long way 
 actually it took 
 this is not on the topic 
 but I did finish it 
 But my wife went to the uh Home Depot I think it was and took uh a copy took a piece of brick
 and she wanted to paint the shed 
 it's a wooden shed uh 
 and she took it 
 and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint
 And uh they got 
 uh and in fact she put some right ba- 
 she got 
 they mixed uh a gallon of it 
 and uh it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint uh 
 and it does it uh oh electronically something magic 
 Yeah 
 you know they 
 but it's electronic
 Uh you put your sample under this thing 
 and it looks at it uh and determines the 
 and it's really remarkable 
 Uh the problem they had 
 and then they wanted some gray to do the trim
 uh but didn't occur to them um that they could have taken a sample um from 
 I forgotten 
 *[[listen]] this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something 
 but anyway it's remarkable 
 That's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the you know 
 you want this to look like this 
 and you want that to look like that 
 and of course if it's all white you're all right 
 but when you start getting into colors 
 have you had problems getting colors to match
 Um
 So
 Gosh
 So you 
 so what's your 
 what's the solution then
 Oh my 
 Well at least you'll get very good at it right
 You could go back and paint the whole thing over 
 uh this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting 
 because uh it seems like everybody has you know to go in and do 
 I'll just do a little bit here and a little there 
 Although the uh 
 uh it 
 we almost one day 
 we painted the house to uh 
 we painted the whole inside 
 and it had all this dark trim 
 We thought uh you know 
 we did the one wall but the other trim 
 I'm trying to think 
 I think we left most of it because it gets to be uh 
 they don't do that in the newer houses now 
 we don't 
 the mold everything is white 
 In a new house everything is white
 Oh good luck 
 We wound up selling the house
 Actually I don't know whether it made 
 actually it does 
 it's interesting that the white um makes the rooms look bigger 
 One of the 
 in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding uh like picture frames I don't know what you that actually that are along the walls you know up a couple of feet
 And my wife painted the insides of those dark blue
 And uh it makes the room look remarkably smaller
 The trim is still white
 the molding 
 but by 
 and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive
 but it makes the room look smaller uh uh which is 
 it explains why they have everything white 
 but [ I + you wouldn't think that I 
 well maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff 
 but 
 Uh not particularly 
 because the house has so many windows
 uh it has 
 the living room has four uh good size windows 
 and uh well of course at night 
 but with the 
 we have a soccer field that's um oh about a hundred yards from our house 
 and the lights shine right at our house 
 It's kind of 
 we didn't know that when we bought the house 
 but 
 Yeah 
 We have a lot of light 
 yeah 
 And well uh I think it's just the dark blue to about three feet 
 and then above that we left it white 
 so Anyway it didn't change 
 but the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away 
 it didn't 
 it kind of bled under the masking tape which I guess is probably the topic we're really on to that the masking is 
 you have to do that very very carefully
 That's right 
 You can work yourself to death 
 Well I'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend
 It's kind of frustrating
 Well I've got to go to a meeting 
 It's been good talking to you
 Okay 
 Good-bye
