 Okay 
 so 
 Right 
 what 
 Uh
 No 
 I I'm in uh well 
 I live in uh Richardson Texas 
 and uh 
 Yeah
 uh but grew up in uh Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of lawn and garden work 
 Uh and uh 
 Yeah
 No
 So uh uh not growing up familiar with here uh uh when I get a chance I listen to that Neil Sperry and do that 
 And uh 
 Yeah 
 Uh 
 Yeah
 Don't do uh any gardening in the sense of uh vegetable gardening 
 but uh tried some different flowers and uh bushes and stuff and uh uh have a lawn service 
 There was one when we bought the house 
 and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one 
 but in terms of the fertilizing and uh weed control mainly leave that up to them 
 What about you
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Well <>
 Well good
 Yeah 
 No 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 what kind of a 
 is this some sort of a disease 
 or is it a pest 
 what kind of trees are they
 Huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Well that's one thing that we've had very poor luck with in our yard is trees
 but uh what trees were there when we moved in uh uh had been put in by the developer when he built the house 
 and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree I think 
 And uh figured up last night 
 there were seven different trees of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in 
 and we got one left at this point 
 but uh a couple of them the weren't too good trees we've lost to wind uh uh 
 three we've lost to to uh freezes between uh eighty-three uh and then uh a year ago we lost uh another one 
 Well d- 
 Yeah 
 we didn't have any that were that big when they uh went 
 two of them uh the wind blew over uh in terms of getting them down
 Uh the 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Now the last one that we lost a year ago uh up until then they hadn't been big enough 
 but what I just used a hand saw and sawed them off as close to ground level as I could and then uh got some chemical that drill holes and pour in that helps rot the 
 yeah stump killer and stump rotter
 But uh this last one had a fair sized root 
 and some guy was doing a job in the neighborhood uh 
 and saw it and stopped in and asked if I didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty-five bucks 
 and I said fine 
 he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that 
 and it 
 yeah 
 and it just ripped it right out 
 and uh I took the 
 he left the chips 
 and I put them up mulch around the other shrubs and uh uh had a pile of dirt from various things uh back by the garage that I filled in with 
 and it's filling in with grass uh nicely this year so that that was worth it 
 but uh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 but uh 
 Yeah 
 well y- 
 do you do your own uh lawn in terms of uh mowing
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 I 
 uh yeah 
 we just got a old push uh uh Sears mower 
 it's been fifteen years now since we first moved to Texas we've had it 
 and I keep waiting for it to die 
 but every year it just seems to hang on 
 uh and uh I do it myself 
 But uh yeah 
 we- 
 a year ago took it into Sears to have it tuned up for the season 
 and they said no it's too old 
 we won't even work on it
 And I took it back home 
 and it's 
 can't 
 kept 
 plugs along 
 But uh 
 But uh one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have <>
