 So uh what do you think 
 Yeah
 Oh really 
 So they have n- 
 I didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas
 Oh that's great because they don't have it in Florida 
 In New York they have it
 I mean you know like I say I'm in New York 
 and we have a state tax as well 
 So that just cuts even more
 Right 
 I think that I 
 I mean I wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't go to any place 
 You know you don't see it going to any place where it belongs
 I think [ um if it were to be + hold on a second please someone just walked in the ro- *[[seems to me that the "hold on" should be a separate slash unit marked 'ad' and shouldn't continue into B15]] if it were to be ] spent in the right way I think I wouldn't be so upset about it 
 *[[see B13 note]] but given that it's not spent properly I think it's a major problem
 Uh-huh 
 <> Well that's certainly true 
 Well what is it they were just talking about um sort of how middle income people 
 what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction 
 but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something
 I think tha- 
 so they want I think they're trying 
 I think that most of the politicians understand this 
 they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing
 Right
 Uh-huh
 I agree 
 I agree
 Right 
 exactly 
 and then uh I'm just not sure you know if I see it going like I say to the right places 
 I mean it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older
 You know but I'm not convinced that Social Security is doing as well as it should [ and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty-five to ninety percent of them who don't need it But I mean the real people who really need it you know should be getting it 
 but instead I think it's going to the wrong places
 You think so
 I know 
 and that scares the hell out of me
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I don't 
 well because they're the ones who make the laws *[[seems like a slash unit to me]] So who's going to yell at them you know 
 *[[ should be an independent slash unit See B39 utt3]] it'd be nice if we sort of as one band together 
 uh and performed a citizens arrest I guess
 To see if we could sort of clean them up 
 and you know but I don't know if we can do that or not
 Uh-huh 
 I agree 
 I agree 
 But um yeah 
 like you said I wonder you know if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process 
 and I wonder if it'll ever be a change process
 I sort of get discouraged when I think about all the things that I think are wrong 
 You know all those things that really could be changed you know that aren't 
 And tax is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list
 So I don't kno- 
 I have no idea what to do about it
 Yeah 
 Right 
 We don't 
 I mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another
 Right 
 I've never quite understood that uh you know even though um I've never been uh sort of politically minded 
 but it's never been clear to me as to sort of um you know how Congressmen can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas when clearly their constituency doesn't back them up on anything you know 
 And often times that will happen
 Right 
 Right
 They do forget it's true because everybody 
 think of what happens is whenever the one who made that supposed mistake turns around 
 and uh his or her opponent can say well look they did this
 And they can turn around and say well my opponent did this
 So it becomes uh a general battle of the sort of the election of the lesser of two evils I think 
 so 
 I don't know 
 uh I'm unhappy with it 
 but 
 And well I'm sort of semifortunate right now 
 I'm a graduate student 
 so I don't make that much
 and what I make isn't taxed very highly because I'm still in school
 But [ my wife has a real job 
 and you know when I get her job um you know we look at her paycheck I'm just floored when I see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep
 Especially around bonus time
 Bonus 
 she 
 no 
 my wife does
 My wi- 
 I don- 
 no 
 graduate students don't get bonuses
 We're lucky to get paychecks the way I figure
 my wife is taxed on her bonus as well 
 and that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually
 I mean her bonus isn't that much 
 but they tax it as 
 I guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something
 So she gets destroyed on her bonus check
 So she works [ in sales 
 So a good portion of you know her salary is quarterly bonuses
 Yes 
 well yeah 
 she's not entirely sales so it isn't as lucrative as one would hope 
 but it keeps us supported temporarily until I can get a real salary and then get taxed more 
 So I don't know 
 I guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it and hope that it gets better 
 Same here 
 tough topic 
 so 
 I beli- 
 I do agree with you most wholeheartedly
 It's been a pleasure talking with you
 Thanks for call 
 You too 
 Bye-bye
