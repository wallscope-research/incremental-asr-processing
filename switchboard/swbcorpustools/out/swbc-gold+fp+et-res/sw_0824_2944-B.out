 Oh okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well what's scary is uh uh about two three four months ago in the Sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here The DALLAS MORNING NEWS
 They showed a reporter um and a copy editor how they went out 
 and they just took um a fellow in John Q Public in Dallas 
 and all they had was 
 let's see they had something like his birth date the street address 
 um they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name excuse me 
 and it was um very scary to see what they found out 
 I mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against you know two or three houses through two divorces children's names locations 
 um it was really frightening
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 uh-huh
 I do too 
 yeah 
 the other thing I don't like is um in terms of uh 
 like we just moved here from uh Minneapolis 
 and uh to get the very nice townhouse that we're in you were required by the property management firm that was representing a private landlo- 
 you know husband and wife owners um who had never done this before 
 They um asked us for again an astounding amount of information 
 and what we really didn't have the same opportunity 
 you know and I guess that's when I also get upset that if you're going to do it then I want to do it too
 Um in terms of the credit 
 yeah 
 I know um we're also going through adoption now
 in for an adoption 
 and I mean after we gave our fingerprints to the F B I yeah you look at each other and say well it's too late now
 Um so I mean it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try um 
 Uh-huh 
 go ahead
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 it isn't 
 Positive for anything 
 see yeah 
 See uh and I just started working well for an electronics firm down here 
 I used to be a reporter
 And then now I'm in corporate communications
 and uh part of that excuse me was as a new hire that I had to take a drug test
 and I had never been asked that 
 and I thought um I really didn't like it 
 Um I have very mixed feelings about it 
 I don't disagree or agree with you
 Um I think that it's well 
 and you're in that field 
 so I don't know 
 but it's 
 you know we lived in uh Minneapolis when the Northwest Airlines pilot in the Dakotas 
 yeah 
 that hit the fan like uh 
 uh you're obviously aware of that um 
 I don't know there should be some happy medium in terms of 
 if they're going to do random um 
 I don't agree with random 
 I guess I would look for a standard in consistency You know in terms of maybe at set intervals so that everybody knows what's going on 
 um I don't see a problem with that 
 I do think I see some level of necessity um in something where people are transporting other people uh only because of the things you've heard about 
 The problem is 
 the reason I feel that way even to a low degree is because it's the old story the minority make it bad for the you know majority um
 Yeah 
 I'm not alarmed
 You can't 
 yeah 
 I know it's um 
 Right 
 right 
 it's a matter 
 and that's um exactly what it is
 I mean that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion 
 Um if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to Romania
 I mean if 
 you hate to say that 
 but that's the way it is
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 In terms of the privacy yeah 
 that in it 
 and also I agree with that 
 and in terms of the question um in terms uh 
 I worked in medical public relations for almost a decade
 and that was pre-AIDS and all the other um things that were probably there but just not excuse me labeled 
 and I have a real problem with medical professionals 
 um it goes back to the things like drug screening 
 but if it's in any level even with the potential to endangerment 
 um and I think this is much stronger than you know pilots or uh train engineers being screened
 um the transmission of the AIDS virus um 
 i- 
 i- 
 that's a real ethical problem 
 I mean I don't have the answer 
 {E you know I mean } I think of the young girl in Florida who 
 well yeah 
 that's 
 was she from your part of the country 
 Or was she from 
 The young girl that uh contracted AIDS through her dentist allegedly
 And then they proved it 
 yeah
 um I don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general or what um
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 the 
 I guess the question is uh 
 the thing for me is who sets the parameters or who has the control you know
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Oh it's ter- 
 I'm uh 
 very seriously 
 no- 
 more than just seriously 
 I'm more than likely going to be going to law school in the Fall
 And yeah 
 if I figure out that's still what I really want to do 
 and the things I'm finding out are in terms of things like privacy the way the law is interpreted presented
 um it's no better than journalism Um except in journalism it's words 
 um this is very frightening in that uh oh 
 and uh in Texas they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents whether it's domestic or international 
 they're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check 
 Yet if you're caught with 
 let's just say um that somebody who's in ne- 
 not us 
 but somebody who's need of carting um aluminum beer cans around 
 they haven't touched them 
 they haven't drank them
 they picked them up off the street 
 and they want to take them to a recycling uh resource for money or whatever 
 Um they've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again um because they've been arresting people like that
 You know 
 Because um in our case one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level because you have to deal with the I N 
 yeah 
 because you have to deal with the uh imi- immigration service 
 Yeah 
 it is 
 it's uh 
 the whole thing is 
 I mean again there's no consistency 
 You know like in your 
 in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly um I can't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval 
 or you know I mean 
 they do that in Texas
 They don't do it for drugs 
 what they do is they check to see if you've got uh current insurance 
 or they check to see if you're permits are 
 Yeah 
 I know 
 and it's kind of um 
 what's the word I want 
 I don't 
 it's ju- 
 to me it's just frightening you know
 I mean the old uh 
 I'm old enough now where George Orwell 
 uh way past time 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's exactly true 
 I mean I 
 Well look at what we're talking now 
 I mean it's 
 look how we're talking now 
 I mean you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger you know
