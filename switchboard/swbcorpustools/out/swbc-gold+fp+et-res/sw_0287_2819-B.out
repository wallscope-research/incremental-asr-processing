 Uh I'm at a little bit of a loss 
 you know I don't know 
 ten years ago 
 see I'm about uh twenty-eight now 
 so when I was eighteen 
 things haven't changed a whole lot
 People are being a little less bigoted in some ways 
 I don't know
 seems to me
 I guess I'm like my parents 
 The younger generation gets away with hell 
 but uh 
 Well it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted 
 but that may just be because I've changed 
 You know I used to live up north 
 Down here Dallas seems to me the police are militant
 but uh 
 I lived in Akron Ohio
 Oh
 Oh about eight years
 In fact in the eight years I've been here it seems to me it gets to be more and more restrictive place to live I think
 Yeah 
 I think it's 
 crime has got a lot worse in the last ten fifteen years 
 and maybe that has a lot to do with it
 Yeah 
 that's true
 That's true
 I'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved
 but that's more a matter of 
 you know I'm no longer a teenager in high school
 Hello 
 Somebody's at the door
 Hang on just a second
 <> Okay
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 it's getting more and more expensive to live
 you can't make it
 I guess when I was growing up it was still the ideal to get a home and buy house 
 and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever
 you know you just don't buy a house
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 for me it's kind of hard 
 I don't know 
 I think 
 I don't know I think the middle class is shrinking and the uh lower class is expanding
 and sooner or later there's going to be a turn around
 But I think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class uh
 so usually is I think
 It's hard for me to say 
 I hope it happens because I'd be one of those that gets caught 
 But on the other hand there's a lot of injustice that needs to be changed
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I'm in semiconductor
 Yeah
 About eight years 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 so am I
 Two
 Well 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I've probably seen him around
 Are you D A D or something up there
 Are you D A D or something
 Yeah 
 well seventh floor
 T A D
 Well 
 Yeah 
 flat dry and dirty
 Yeah 
 I lived in the country for several years 
 and living in the city is a whole different uh social structure 
 but uh 
 I don't even know
 I haven't been up there in years
 No 
 I haven't been back in ten fifteen years
 Yeah 
 I do 
 I just haven't had a chance to get back 
 Catch them next year probably
 I don't know 
 I think we ran out of social changes to talk about 
 so 
 Okay
 Yeah
 All righty 
 bye
