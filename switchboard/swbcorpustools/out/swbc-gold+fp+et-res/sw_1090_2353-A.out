 So what do you think about a year or two of public service
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 You know I really agree with you 
 Um uh though I've never done that myself I was a basically an education major when I graduated from college 
 and I accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to um very rural children in a very low income district 
 and I spent a year teaching there
 and I think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because I come from nice middle class white suburban home
 and I did it um for one reason I wanted 
 I was working on a masters degree 
 so I wanted to stay close to where I was working on a masters degree but also because I just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing
 and I 
 it probably changed my political views 
 it changed my understanding of the world around me
 and I think um in fact if I had to do it all again I you know 
 after that you know you never think of it I guess because I paid for all of my college education myself I never thought about doing that because I had all these college loans I'd started paying back
 Um beca- so that was one reason why I never considered it 
 but now that I'm further along and I'm still paying these college loans I think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school at thirty years old
 um I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed
 and I thought that was you know very interesting 
 and I would have thought of that earlier 
 I probably would have done you know just like is that the Mormon church that does that
 Because one of my neighbors uh did that in Pittsburgh from Pittsburgh
 And I thought you know that really 
 now that I'm thirty years old I think that one or two years out of my life would have 
 probably like you said to be able to travel some place else whether it be the United States or outside the country I think it would have been a very good um experience for me
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 And I think you know we have such a need now you know 
 I taught you know 
 I think I was paid uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year
 and I worked in a very rural school district 
 and one of the things I taught was a computer class
 and these kids um you know every girl I taught except for one was pregnant
 Many of the boys in the room had children 
 and they were high school juniors
 And I just 
 there you know they came from poverty 
 they were going to condition in poverty 
 and it was the school district couldn't hire many people 
 it was very difficult for them to hire 
 and I think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um things I think it's a really good idea And even if it is overseas 
 See I never 
 I tell you sometimes I worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think it would also help them if they then went on to college 
 I know that my first couple of years of college were um uh probably too carefree at the beginning 
 and then at the end I had to be too serious 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Uh-huh 
 that's right
 I 
 yeah 
 I think this was a very interesting topic uh because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough
 Uh you know 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Uh-huh
 Oh I think it is 
 I really think 
 I think um people 
 you should 
 I you know 
 the kids today I teach 
 I spend a lot of my time teaching college students
 and um I find great disgust in them in um their self-centeredness and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situation
 and I really you know 
 they don't understand uh how other people live um 
 they don't understand
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think that's uh just having a good time
 I uh 
 a friend of mine is a psychologist 
 and he always refers to it as short-term pleasure oriented
 I guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it you know 
 today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented
 and everything has to be an immediate reward 
 and it has to be fun
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Well they say 
 I think I um have read recently that uh the Bush Administration has increased the funding for the Peace Corps
 Uh-huh 
 Because I guess because of the changes in Eastern Europe uh they've increased funding for the Peace Corps 
 I guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known
 when they're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps 
 and some of the are the overseas programs Uh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's very true 
 You know how many 
 is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country 
 and I guess I live near Washington being in Baltimore it's something like one in four people in the Washington area are lawyers
 and I just sort of think that's ridiculous
 Yeah 
 with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 you saw statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run
 Yeah 
 that's true
 That's interesting Uh-huh
 Okay 
 Hey 
 thanks so much for the conversation
 Well thank you very much 
 Bye-bye
