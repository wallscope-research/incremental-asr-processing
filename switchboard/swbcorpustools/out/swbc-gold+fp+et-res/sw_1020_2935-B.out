 Well we've tried having 
 let me turn the T V off 
 we've tried having a vegetable garden 
 and I'm from Chicago 
 and the way that uh bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from Chicago
 And we have tried several years in a row 
 and we've given up between the fire ants the pill bugs the weeds the drought and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer 
 and we just kind of uh decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden 
 We had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought Who'd want to eat that stuff
 You know so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here 
 and uh if you really water a lot you can do it 
 but you know when you have to pay for water it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly
 So right now we're just 
 Yeah 
 we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now and the trees
 We have a peach tree 
 That's the extent of um contributing to our food supply 
 But that's nice to have 
 but Yeah 
 yeah 
 So what do you do up there
 Um
 Oh wow
 Yeah
 Really 
 Gosh
 Oh boy
 that sounds wonderful
 If you don't have a frost you'll be all right 
 That's what I remember from living up north is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost 
 and half the stuff would get frostbitten 
 and you'd have to 
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Oh boy 
 that's frustrating
 Oh yeah 
 my husband does that thank goodness because that's not a pleasure for me 
 I love gardens that are well tended 
 and I just 
 there's been a few different places I've lived where I've just n- 
 I don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what but you could just tell that they had uh a love affair with their gardens with beautiful wild flowers 
 and just 
 I love the host of colors that just keep coming all you know year long 
 And uh I was in England once 
 and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had they had a beautiful garden in it 
 You know it could be three feet by four feet or something
 So I do admire that but I haven't really put uh too much energy into it
 Course we have two little kids that are two and three years old 
 So that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry I'll tell you 
 Tha- 
 yeah 
 that's really lovely 
 I would love to have different fruit trees 
 it's been wonderful to have the peaches 
 They're just delicious 
 And we still have to spray some 
 but we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison which is good 
 because I just 
 I can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards
 Um we've tried them 
 but again it's just like the sun scorch
 We've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the s- 
 I mean it's just 
 you really have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer 
 People that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation and installed that 
 and um that's really what makes the most sense 
 because you don't have to use so much water 
 and 
 it really does the job 
 But it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here
 And if you're not really committed to it 
 I mean me you know I'm real committed to it for about a week and then I forget about it for a week 
 and then I go Oh yeah I need to do something 
 and by then it's burned up you know
 It's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives 
 so maybe when I get older I'll find uh some joy in that 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it just gets so hot so fast here 
 We don't have really a Spring or a Fall
 and it just uh immediately heats up 
 So that's one thing I miss about living up north as I remember um you know the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather 
 It was really nice
 We always had gardens when I was uh living in Chicago 
 In fact my mother once tore up our entire back yard and redid it 
 I'll never forget 
 Got my stepfather to put in uh a waterfall and a little pond in one corner 
 I mean that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time I ever knew him 
 They remodeled the entire back yard 
 Then they sold the house and got divorced 
 so I don't know what that says about it all 
 Oh but she used to love to do stuff like that
 Yeah 
 it really was 
 I enjoyed it there 
 But maybe when the boys get a little older we'll do some more planting 
 because they like to see things grow 
 They've done a couple of little seed projects 
 and so I think it would be fun for them
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Oh yes 
 They're both running around now
 Yeah 
 well it's very therapeutic 
 I think really to get out there and dig in the dirt you know 
 They certainly enjoy that part of it 
 It's just trying to keep anything 
 I planted bulbs last uh Fall on the side guard and when I went out there in the Spring 
 and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off 
 and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk 
 He thought what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with
 At least he didn't eat them 
 I mean I guess I could be thankful for that
 Yeah 
 really 
 If they survive this year 
 Oh well good luck to you
 Nice talking to you
