 That's a good question 
 Uh there was a point where I would have said no that no one would deserve to die for a crime that he committed 
 But uh since I've become a parent and since I've seen uh things like Jeffrey Dahlmer I really have to question that 
 I can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people
 And uh try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment 
 Uh 
 Oh uh it's a question of your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response
 Uh and that was the thing that uh killed Dukakis back uh four years ago when someone asked him a similar question 
 and he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when uh people wanted to see if he was going to go for uh a gut level reaction 
 And I think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level 
 Uh you know whether it be a biblical force uh you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life type logic or just uh uh some sort of anger at putting uh murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life uh while we foot the bill
 I think people are working at that from more of uh a gut reaction than a reason humane one
 That's true
 Uh the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent 
 and I really don't uh agree with that 
 I don't think anyone who would commit uh a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say well I was about to kill and dismember this person 
 but oh if they catch me they're going to kill me 
 so I better not do it 
 I just don't think uh that it works that way
 Uh-huh
 Well I don't know if that would really work that way or not 
 Uh there's a lot of violence
