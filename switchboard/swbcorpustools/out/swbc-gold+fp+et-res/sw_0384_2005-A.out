 Okay 
 Uh first um I need to know uh how do you feel uh about sending uh an elderly uh family member to a nursing home
 Yes 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Probably the hardest thing in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home 
 and um she had used the walker for quite some time probably about six to nine months 
 And um she had a fall 
 and uh finally uh she had Parkinson's disease
 and it got so much that she could not take care of her house
 Then she lived in an apartment 
 and uh that was even harder actually
 Because you know it was just a change of location 
 and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling
 I mean she had children all across the United States
 and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children
 And um that was pretty heart-rending for her
 I think when she finally came to the realization that you know no I cannot take care of myself
 Yeah 
 I mean for somebody who you know for most of their life has uh not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines
 And you know facing that situation it's quite a dilemma
 I think 
 Yeah 
 Well uh my uh 
 probably one of the biggest decisions I think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision than just delegate it 
 I think that they had a great deal of um 
 all the brothers and sisters got together 
 and they actually had a conference
 And I mean it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that
 and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them you know making that decision and then finding a place 
 and everybody had duties to perform 
 You know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot of the decision making you know like finding a proper nursing home
 And they 
 I know 
 and well they had seen it coming
 so 
 I mean it 
 I mean I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well we 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well with my grandmother I think it was such uh that she did not have the problem with 
 she was very well aware 
 and her daughter came and visited her
 at least her daughter came and visited her and also her several grandchildren came and visited her every day
 And I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest 
 um I think it would be 
 it was more of a relief for her
 And um 
 I mean but she was truly aware 
 I mean I don't know how I would deal if one of my parents came with Alzheimer's or something like that which is far more devastating
 And um I think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care 
 That the people that worked there were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible
 I think you know for myself I see that as probably the what everything would hinge upon
 Is it 
 how close is it to a home environment
 that's probably the major question
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 You know it's interesting that the population of the United States is changing because you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time
 Um matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families
 It wasn't
 But I guess as we become more industrialized and more you know less in a rural situation we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier
 Uh Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I think that perhaps the extended family you know that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care
 You know I mean of course there comes other issues you know whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like they're going to be a good caretaker for our children
 But 
 I mean they raised us after all
 Yeah 
 But uh I think that you know uh I mean I've had a lot of good experiences uh with many people especially where they've had uh extended family 
 and I kind of see that you know perhaps you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and get down to the values of you know 
 I mean uh it's 
 money seems to be too big of an issue with what's going on today 
 and I think that that may be you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem
 I mean I mean we may not have as high a standard of living
 but actually have a truer standard of living
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Okay 
 Well I guess that was it 
 Okay
 All right
 Hey
 Bye-bye
