 Okay 
 Well uh I'll let you start I guess 
 Uh no 
 I mean I'm not 
 my employer does not do that Uh although uh I had an ex-employer that 
 uh the previous job I used to have uh they 
 I guess a few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test
 Uh I don't know 
 My feeling is that certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb uh if should somebody be under the influence of drugs I'd be willing to support that 
 For example uh uh well uh uh train engineers
 Because you know uh like there was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer you know 
 he crashed and killed some people because he was uh smoking some marijuana
 and I guess air traffic controllers I wouldn't want them to be on drugs And airplane pilots 
 But uh in that regard where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property uh I would seriously question it 
 Uh so 
 So it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent 
 Yeah 
 Well i- 
 Huh
 Right 
 And 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I agree 
 I mean well there's also the issue of uh 
 out here I remember hearing a year or so ago that uh a lot of 
 there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results 
 or I shouldn't say high
 I mean several percent 
 Kind of a coarse kind of test
 Is that done 
 Right
 Now let me ask you this 
 Uh at the time you hired on with this company uh was that prior to any 
 Okay 
 so this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this
