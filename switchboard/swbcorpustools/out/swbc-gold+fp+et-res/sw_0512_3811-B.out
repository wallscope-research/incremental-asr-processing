 Yeah 
 we 
 Two year old daughter in child care + ] 
 and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh pretty reasonable price we think
 How about you 
 do you have any children
 Oh boy
 Yeah
 Are you 
 Where are a student
 No kidding
 I was a professor in a university here in California for a while
 Yeah 
 uh are you going to uh put your son in child care in a year or two
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well that's a good experience I think 
 and uh there are a lot of things to think about 
 and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good 
 and they kind of boil down to uh 
 any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative
 and what we found uh to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were going to be loving
 and uh that's more important than anything else 
 We could have sent uh her to a fancier uh facility
 Uh she goes to a home 
 This is uh a couple uh emigrated from China early in their lives 
 They've been here probably thirty forty years
 They've got three daughters 
 Uh and they have a loving home 
 and uh they're both there 
 and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon
 And our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends 
 so it's a good experience 
 I th- 
 if it's good 
 I think it's very good for the child 
 And if it's a loving environment I think it's very good 
 and and that's really what we've learned about it 
 She'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year
 but uh we feel real fortunate 
 and we were able to uh just uh choose in the marketplace 
 I don't know what it's like around uh Hattiesburg
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I'll bet they're involved
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well that's uh 
 I know it's a real hard thing to do even for people in uh university communities
 Out here at Manford they have a real good facility 
 and there uh is quite a waiting list to get into that
 So it's an important decision 
 it's an industry that's still a cottage industry
 and I think this Well it is the best way to do it interestingly 
 I think that uh my own interest in human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that uh private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn
 Because I think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market 
 As a matter of fact my future is banked on that uh professionally because I believe that there are uh pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care
 Primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life
 it's phenomenal
 It's phenomenal the human operating system
