 Okay 
 I guess it took 
 so I guess the recording has started now
 Uh
 I served 
 I was in the Air Force and served on a court martial uh board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury 
 A lot of the same rules apply 
 Have you ever served on one
 Uh-huh
 Was it civil or criminal
 A grand jury or 
 Uh-huh
 I see
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh did the judge uh hand down sentences 
 or did you folks do that
 Uh-huh
 Um
 No
 that's a science in itself
 Uh-huh 
 I see
 Because you'd probably be uh too puritanical 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 So uh were the uh sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair 
 or would 
 if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different
 Huh
 Um
 Wow 
 I bet that made him happy
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Oh how many members were on the jury 
 Was it a six or twelve member jury
 Uh-huh
 That's kind of curious to me 
 I didn't realize until the uh Wayne Kennedy Smith trial uh a few months ago that they had six member juries 
 I thought that you know it was always twelve men tried and true so to speak
 But uh apparently for some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment
 I know on a 
 getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous 
 It's a simple majority you know rules
 Probably on capital 
 I don't know 
 we 
 the two that I were on had to do with drugs
 and uh we were uh unanimous is acquitting the person even though we in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of various things 
 the government really failed to prove its case 
 and you know being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof 
 and we had to acquit him in both cases
 Uh yeah 
 it was yeah in some of the critical things like special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person 
 but something happened to the camera and the tape and 
 all they could do was testify
