 Yeah 
 at first I 
 it took eight times to find you 
 
 so I told my husband uh you know 
 what should I say 
 and then he reminded me 
 but uh uh in his family uh what they usually do on his dad's side his mom or uh the aunts will send out little postcards like two or three weeks before reminding everyone where to meet and you know just to bring anything 
 and so they just notify everyone by mail 
 and then they just meet at like a park or something to have like uh or a small uh dinner type thing
 Uh well they all meet in Portland 
 and they come as far as oh Seattle 
 and sometimes we've gone 
 and we were living in Utah at the time
 And uh his dad's family is all around the area 
 and his mom's side of the family they all uh have their family reunions in southern Utah 
 and people would come from Seattle to there uh let's see Nevada and in that area Washington and Nevada to southern Utah 
 and each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and the people who are down there like they'll assign one person in the Utah area one person in the Washington area 
 and that person can call you know beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too
 And then they just sort of do like a little program or you know something like that so that everyone's sort of involved
 Oh well that's my husband's side and or my family uh 
 we all live in southern California 
 so we just have to either or give a formal invite 
 and we're all there 
 so 
 Yeah 
 well I mean L A Orange County area 
 I mean everyone's you know mostly not farther than an hour away
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 Wow 
 Well you know that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my uh husband's mother's side together is uh they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time 
 and uh inevitably everyone is just very interested 
 and they always have you know two or three new ones to add to the list you know someone's been born or someone passed away or you know something like that 
 and so everyone has to update their little books or whatever
 Uh I do but not very much compared to my mother-in-law
 Um
 Oh
 Really
 Is it your grandma's own sibling 
 and she 
 Oh I see 
 Oh so 
 Well maybe uh they just moved away and then sort of lost contact
