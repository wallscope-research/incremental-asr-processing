 Uh yes 
 I am 
 I'm working in the computer science department here uh at C M U
 Uh I'm doing basically system design work and uh implementation work for the speech group uh here
 Yeah 
 actually through electronic mail
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 So it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away at this point 
 Yeah
 Well um I'm research stuff here now 
 so they have uh um okay benefits package 
 It's not quite as good as industry 
 but one of the significant um benefits here is that you can take uh up to two courses a semester um 
 and they you know pay for the classes 
 So Carnegie Mellon that works out to be um a reasonable benefit
 Uh-huh 
 If you want to do it quickly
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 So I don't know in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary 
 you know I 
 Yeah 
 we do 
 We have to contribute a certain amount uh to it
 And it's kind of split between C M U and you know the employee
 Right
 Yeah 
 and right now it's uh the 
 like everywhere else uh 
 here in Pittsburgh the health care uh rates are going up pretty quickly
 That's a whole other topic to begin with too 
 but 
 Yeah 
 but you are right 
 I really agree that that's pretty important
 Right 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Oh 
 Now that's a big win
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 That's 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I figured for 
 and they've just raised the um income caps on Social Security to the point where you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying that as well 
 Yeah 
 well if you could call it a benefit that C M U I mean i- 
 the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is consult for um you know other companies
 Um so that kind of helps out in terms of you know keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry
 You know you know in case you ever need to bail out 
 Uh-huh
