 Sounds 
 But I gather you do not separate uh the bottles and cans
 Uh-huh 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 I know 
 Not only have I come to Washington but uh I find it very amusing that uh the thing that was just instituted here is very similar 
 That is we also have blue bins 
 We also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and uh landfill space is in deed the driving factor here 
 And in fact uh despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still uh very hard to come by
 A- 
 Ah 
 but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will
 Well uh 
 Yes 
 other than nuking it
 Um in fact Los Alamos uh has uh done a fair amount of research uh in recycling things in general 
 Um it involves for instance uh creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and uh other things from uh waste material in general uh and purify the waste of specific uh uh nasty elements
 And the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody made some special uh polymers that have the ability to uh make certain actinide elements adhere to them
 Uh uh they've uh looked at uh plutonium and uranium and uh some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste 
 and again this is driven by all of the documentation and uh E S and H uh uh considerations that uh people are uh worrying about I think much more than they should 
 Actually I've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable 
 Back when I was in graduate school I did all of the recycling of the uh paper from the computer center 
 and uh in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recycled paper 
 I think that's a wonderful idea
 The only alternative I would see is uh and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain Uh if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would uh speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill 
 and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more
 Uh uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
