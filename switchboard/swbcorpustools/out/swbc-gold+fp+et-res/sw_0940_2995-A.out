 There you go
 Oh well people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something You know that try to sell you the newspaper and uh carpet cleaning and uh what else roof repair 
 And enough 
 well I think it's a waste of paper the people that always leave uh junk mail because um you just end up throwing it away most of the time 
 Probably eighty percent of the junk mail that you get is um something that you don't need 
 And the same way with those calls 
 What is it 
 oh M C I really does 
 Even when you tell them no they keep calling back
 M C I 
 it's the long distance telephone company
 Uh-huh 
 well they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason 
 They just keep calling back
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 You can't force them to be 
 No
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 because they follow them around twenty-four hours a day
 And you know they do Ted Kennedy
 Of course he's breaking the law all the time 
 so it's a different story then 
 You know I mean you know who cares about Ed McMahon 
 He's probably hasn't done anything interesting in the last thirty years that they've been on the air you know 
 And he has a chauffeur 
 Maybe he drinks 
 but he never drives a car either you know 
 it's not the same with Johnny Carson
 Uh-huh
 and without your permission
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh good
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Well you have to have the telephone 
 but you can't you know 
 and sometimes it's hard to screen out all the calls that you don't want
 Uh-huh
 Um
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 uh-huh
 Sometimes 
 yeah 
 some days it just rings off the wall
 No 
 no
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah 
 even if I guess it's for coupons they have a survey they run 
 and one of them is supposed to be a smokers survey 
 but the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking
 And you know they start out 
 and they ask you even to your income level 
 I think that's you know 
 whether you buy a T V dinner or not I don't think it has anything to do with
