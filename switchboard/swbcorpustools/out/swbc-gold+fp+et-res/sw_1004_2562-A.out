 All right 
 do you do garden work
 Uh-huh
 Oh where do you go to college
 Where's that
 Oh okay
 Yes 
 Well you know do you do gardening at home
 Oh my goodness
 Hm
 Yeah 
 well I guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest 
 Yeah 
 I had a whole bunch of flowers and things 
 Well I don't have as many now 
 We lived in the country for a long time 
 and I had a whole bunch 
 But now I work and I live in the city so that sort a kind of hung it up 
 I have a few flowers but most of mine are like in barrels and things like that
 And this year I decided that 
 well my husband made a little garden out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it 
 but I decided that I don't like grass 
 I don't like to have to have to pull grass
 so I decided that I would plant me a tomato plant in a flower pot and see how it worked 
 And mine looks real good 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 I had never thought about that 
 I could probably plant one and bring it in just like I bring my plants in every year 
 That'd be neat 
 Well I got a patio 
 and I tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots And planting them all in it you know because that's favorite thing is tomatoes to grow 
 um but he said No 
 he was going to plant in the earth you know like he always has 
 because he's always had a garden out in the country
 And I think he kind of misses it a little bit you know since we moved to the city 
 But um I went ahead and planted one and mine looks better than his 
 It does 
 and then I like um 
 you know what day lilies are
 Day lilies
 Uh-huh
 No 
 no 
 Huh-uh 
 These look like a lily 
 well they really look like an orchid when they come out
 Uh-huh 
 That what the look like 
 but they only bloom for one day
 They'll um 
 you'll have a bud the evening before 
 and then the next morning as soon as the sun hits it it starts opening up 
 and then when it gets dark it closes 
 and that's it 
 It only blooms for one day
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 But um they look like orchids is what they look like 
 but they look like different color ones 
 like I have uh yellow ones 
 and I have red ones 
 and I have purple ones 
 and then they have like you know the real velvety looking stuff inside
 it looks just like orchids in different colors 
 That's what they look like
 they're beautiful 
 Uh I have a friend when I lived out in the country 
 and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year you know or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with
 And I mean they were real expensive 
 They were like well 
 the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty-two fifty for one bulb
 So what she would do is she would plant them and they multiplied 
 So the next year when she you know weeded them out so they wouldn't be as thick she'd give me some of the bulbs 
 And I mean I have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen 
 So when we decided to move it was really funny because like I said I had a whole bunch of different kinds of things
 and I kept saying Well I want to take a few of these and I want to take these and I want to take these 
 My husband finally said Look are we going to take the grass 
 Can we leave the grass 
 I said Yes we may leave that
 And we had a tree that was like seventeen foot tall or something like that that he said No no I am not taking the tree 
 You know I mean every time we went outside he'd look at something that was humongous you know 
 No 
 we're not taking that
 But the last day he said Can't we leave the grass 
 and I said Yeah 
 I think we will leave that 
 But I brought 
 my kids when they were little they had given me some azaleas so I brought all my azalea bushes
 And you know I brought as much as I could bring without you know really tearing up their place 
 But just like um you know 
 the people that bought the place um I knew that they would you know 
 if I left like one bulb of each one of them by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them
 So it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something you know 
 it would cover it right up
 But I just couldn't see it you know going off and leaving everything like that
 Because this house I really liked it and everything but the yard was a lot to be desired 
 Oh there was nothing 
 These people 
 we have one ugly pine tree
 I mean and it is ugly
 I even tried making it look nicer you know 
 I tied the yellow ribbon around it 
 and it was so ugly
 Oh it did not help let me tell you 
 I took it off and put it on my door 
 I did not want to call attention 
 I mean it was terrible 
 So really the plants that I brought over and put out here are just about all 
 I don't do any of the mowing or you know edging and all that
 My husband does all that stuff 
 But that's because I'm allergic to the grass
 Really
 Now I like to go to the beach where the sand is 
 because then it doesn't make me ill 
 Yeah 
 I used to until I got so allergic to it 
 I don't know if it's all well 
 I went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds I was allergic to 
 But it's not as bad here 
 like Saint Augustine I think is what we have 
 And it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country
 But out in the country I mean 
 if I went outside while he was mowing the grass I was going to have a gigantic attack
 So um I get shots for it now too 
 That helps a whole bunch
 But one good thing about it see I don't have to mow the grass 
 or 
 I mean that's really nice
 Well the first thing we always plant is tomatoes
 every year 
 I don't care if we don't have anything else 
 we're going to have tomatoes 
 And then we plant cucumbers 
 and 
 Oh yeah
 Really
 It must be the uh 
 Now I mean that's something that grows like a weed here 
 I mean it grows like a weed 
 We have to allow extra room for those you know I mean extra space between the rows and all 
 Yes 
 but I mean we usually get 
 if we plant for every one plant we probably get fifty to sixty cucumbers off of it I mean just pulling them as fast as you can 
 We usually give them to everybody
 Anybody that wants a cucumber can have it 
 But we tried it too where you run it up a fence
 and um we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence 
 I mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other
 I mean it was 
 but they're so heavy you know 
 they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down 
 But I mean cucumbers here grow like crazy
 Of course it's real hot here too
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 now if we have any like the birds will pick or something you know 
 and some of the seeds drop 
 Have you ever had them just come up in different places
 I know we do that too you know 
 and at the first year 
 because I was from the city when we got married 
 and the first year that we planted I couldn't figure out I mean the 
 well the first year after I mean we planted them 
 but the first year you know after we'd had a crop all these little things like 
 we had cucumbers coming up you know in the middle of our okra 
 and I thought how did this get here
 I know I didn't put that seed there 
 And it was weird but the birds had you know evidently just deposited them for us
 Uh-huh
