 Do you have uh some strong feelings one way or the other about the care of the elderly
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well my graduate work is in speech pathology 
 and uh so so uh I've thought about this more than once uh you know dealing with 
 uh you know I'm concerned we're going to have a geriatric uh population in twenty years it's going to be you know phenomenal
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Uh and um but I have been amazed 
 and in talking with uh some of my fellow students it looks as though um nursing homes are not going to be the only option any more 
 and uh in twenty years Uh where a lot of students are hoping uh to work as an in the home type uh uh approach uh where there's you know the speech therapist or whether it's a nursing specialist or someone plans to uh work out of a family's home and take the responsibility away from the family but yet allow the loved one to stay you know at home with the family members 
 Uh it's difficult for many families especially in the case uh of Alzheimer's and uh some of the more degenerative diseases to uh say uh uh to have them at home because then the family becomes completely uh 
 exactly 
 Yeah 
 and did you experience that with your father or not
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Definitely 
 You know one of the other subjects on the switchboard and this is one that I've been thinking applies here uh where uh young young kids uh graduating from high school whether they should do a community service type work 
 This would be an excellent example of uh some place where um the community could be more involved you know more than just leaving it only to professionals 
 There is a lot the community can do to uh or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home
 Possibly before 
 I don't know now
 Uh-huh
 Huh-uh
 Uh-huh
 I agree 
 that's a good point
