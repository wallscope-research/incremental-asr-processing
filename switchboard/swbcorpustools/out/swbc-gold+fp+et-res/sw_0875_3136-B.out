 Yeah 
 I do 
 Oh really
 Did you plant those yourself
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 That's nice 
 I love blackberries 
 and we uh 
 when I was smaller my family lived in Tennessee
 and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick my brother and I 
 But I don't have any down here
 Oh I think I know what they 
 I can't remember what the name of them are either
 Oh
 Down here the grass 
 Well I'm 
 we've had problems with our yard 
 We 
 it was one big weed is what it was
 It was just horrible 
 And my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns 
 and we have this God awful ugly thing 
 And and I know they must think you know I wish those people would do something about their yard 
 But my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that seems to be helping 
 and he put it on the front yard to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard 
 But we've got a Great Dane in the back
 and she has eaten everything I have put out there 
 She's eaten my crepe myrtle trees
 I know 
 and she's eaten the bushes 
 I've tried to I spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there
 and I barricaded it up so she couldn't get into it
 And I went and took a shower and looked back out there 
 and she was already in it 
 And I was so mad 
 So I can't do anything back there Because she destroys it 
 But I've tried out in the front 
 but like you said that freeze that came
 I had uh some shrubs I put out front 
 and it killed those too 
 So I'm just real discouraged with the whole thing 
 I just don't even want to do anything
 Yeah 
 that happened to us 
 We have these 
 I know
 Oh I know 
 Ours don't 
 I know 
 we can't either 
 But I've got two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard Uh you know one on either side of the yard
 and they're big 
 and they're real full and everything you know in the summer time 
 but it's killing everything underneath where the leaves are shading the tree 
 but toward the end of the summer you know when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing 
 But by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops 
 You know it's a never ending cycle 
 Yeah 
 it really is 
 So we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and whatnot 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 <> Huh 
 Yeah 
 Really 
 C- 
 well I don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front 
 and they've got mini-blinds and stuff
 But only one is really like in the flower bed part 
 and the other one is out on the porch
 So there's not really much I can do about that
 Yeah
 I do too 
 that's why I look at my neighbors yard 
 I don't have anything to look at 
 so I look at theirs
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 it's really a pain 
 My husband works a lot 
 so um a lot 
 Yeah 
 I'm 
 it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard 
 <> and I really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it 
 I hate to mow the yard more than anything else 
 I hate to mow that yard
 Yeah 
 well mine's getting there 
 He helps 
 he does half 
 and I do half 
 so Pretty soon though by next year he should be able to do it all by himself Whether he likes it or not
 Oh sure I'll be more then glad to pay him if he'd just go out there and do it and do it to where I don't have to go back out and redo it
 that's my only thing with him
 That's why I'm having him help me now <>
