 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well we have a uh three year old and a one year old 
 And uh so you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know
 And uh most of the time with a three year old we're trying to to get him uh 
 well we play usually in the evening when when I get home you know about five o'clock or so until about eight you know with the exception of dinner 
 Out in the front or backyard playing like uh tee ball off the you know off the ball and let him hit a lot of baseball 
 Uh since we just got here we got the uh uh new two wheel bike with training wheels on it for him 
 and he really likes riding that around
 So you know 
 and trying to supervisor him with that and everything and uh playing squirt guns and all that 
 he really likes that
 And uh the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything 
 trying to do everything he does
 No 
 it's a girl
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I I agree with that 
 and I seem I seem to feel the same way you know 
 even just when I grew up and everything 
 And and the way it is now you get a lot of supervision is is at hand and everything
 Uh the only other thing I have noticed though is that uh it seems that there's been a lot of or more empha- emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with 
 and and the looking you know 
 just start not even 
 not really looking for a school for him but uh like a preschool or something that where he would go maybe a couple hours a couple days a week or something
 For for a three year old it's that uh 
 there's a lot of emphasis on on on on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten
 And and it seems like it's a lot more than the- they need to know and be able to do than when we are the when I had to go in t- ki- kindergarten
 And it seems like it's more uh 
 you know I don't know 
 They're expecting more or uh or just uh you know 
 kids just because of the computer age or whatever it just know more when they get you know to be five or six or something
 But 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 One thing is I got a home computer too 
 and uh I play uh with the three year old 
 I play some computer games and stuff with him
 Educational games like you know concentration type games the matching things like that
 And uh he's he really likes it 
 and uh and I think it's important because I think that uh you know it gives him the interaction with the computer 
 because it sure looks like that's going to be you- you know the big thing for a long time
 And given given that knowledge and stuff with it 
 and he seems to enjoy it
 And uh of course the one year old hasn't hasn't gotten there yet 
 but uh 
 and the other thing we try to do is uh since the summer's time's here is uh sign him up for and her for uh different activities at like the rec center or something like swimming
 you know uh 
 or 
 there's a little soccer thing that he's going to do for a week or so 
 and uh you know 
 where they go for an hour or so
 And uh 
 because uh when he was a baby that we did the swimming too 
 and he really liked it 
 so we're going to do that with our daughter too
 
 
 I know 
 Well we were just talking about that too 
 And I guess it's not really soccer it's just kind of a well kick the ball around for a while see what happens 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Well I know of number of people that are in the in the uh school district an- down in in uh San Antonio 
 And uh it seems like it's 
 a lot of the problem is to you know 
 you always have the lack of funds 
 but it seems to be getting worse and worse 
 and so they don't settle the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as as as kids need 
 And uh you know that's just a problem that who knows how that's going to that's going to come out or anything 
 But 
 
 Uh-huh
