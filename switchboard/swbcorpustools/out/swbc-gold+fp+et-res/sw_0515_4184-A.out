 You have any pets 
 Yeah
 Two dogs 
 what kind
 Schnauzers 
 Is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer
 Uh I'm going into all this because I just got done working at a pet shop actually
 Yeah
 Uh
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 That's good
 They say 
 Didn't expect that would happen 
 Yeah 
 that's cool 
 that's nice 
 Uh let's see 
 what was the other dog you had
 Oh a sheltie
 Yeah
 They can be nippy
 Yeah 
 shelties are nice 
 Everybody seems to be really happy with them 
 They're good temperament
 They put up with a lot 
 Schnauzers in particular probably
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 I g- 
 it seems the smaller the are the worse off they are 
 Yeah 
 they're bred down so much 
 It's 
 They aren't the best pets
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I mean some people seem fairly well suited for uh miniature poodles and such
 Pit bull
 They might 
 they're actually very friendly dogs
 Uh they're really nice 
 I've dealt with quite a few of them 
 customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like they uh fit collars and stuff on them 
 and they are just really nice really friendly uh kind of like medium intelligence Uh
 Well because some people uh want to train them as 
 Yeah
 You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way
 Yeah 
 it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond 
 Right
 Yeah 
 they aren't by nature really nasty critters 
 They are very determined critters
 and so once you get them going it's not good to deal with but I really like them 
 *[[two utts]] I was impressed by them 
 they're real sturdy little critters 
 and they aren't that big And uh just really friendly
 I was overwhelmed
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 right now 
 They picked up a lot of bad press lately
 Well yeah
 But any pet's can be bad if you train it to be that way
 Well yeah 
 it's when 
 in my hometown they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret uh attacking a child in a house
 I mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret 
 the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild
 and you know they should expect something like that to happen 
 And so bas- 
 now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town
 Yeah 
 it bit him
 And that was not a good thing 
 but I think it was probably an individual ferret thing because it was a fairly wild ferret
 they hadn't 
 Yeah 
 I mean they really should have expected it And taken the precautions 
 They didn't
 It's too bad it happened though
 Right
