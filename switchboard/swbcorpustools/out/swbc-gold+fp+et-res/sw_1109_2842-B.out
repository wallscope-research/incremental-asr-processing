 I have a daughter
 Oh okay
 Um well we go out and fly kites 
 and we go fishing
 And we go to movies 
 and we go out to the farm
 and uh she likes to pick flowers and look at birds
 Well I'm divorced 
 but when she's with me that's what we do
 And we color a lot 
 and I read her stories

 Well I think they can turn off the T V for one thing and go out and do stuff you know
 Because she always likes to do things whenever the T Vs off 
 You know she'll forget about the T V completely
