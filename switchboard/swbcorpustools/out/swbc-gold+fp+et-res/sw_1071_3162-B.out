 Yeah
 Right 
 that it 
 I 
 a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and uh not depend so much on the emotions of a particular case but be able to put it in overall perspective
 Well I certainly haven't thought much about this 
 but 
 Yes 
 yes 
 some of them do 
 and some of them don't 
 but uh this one uh 
 I was trying to remember back 
 It seems to me that you know when I studied civics in school or stuff that the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't so much 
 And I'm trying to figure out whether I'm remembering wrong or whether that's by state
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 And uh I guess 
 and I don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some supreme court decision perhaps that said that uh that uh as part of the trial by the peers that had to include the sentencing or too or whatever 
 I 
 yeah 
 but yeah I certainly wouldn't be uh uh worried about that 
 I guess in terms of uh you know having a judge do it would seem to me to be more fair and uh unbiased 
 Uh in terms of doing away with the unanimous jury I guess I uh would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in the trial system 
 that's just such a tradition that it's got to be a unanimous jury that uh I don't know where you'd draw the line anywhere else Uh you know uh two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever
 But uh and I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a bare majority
 Uh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 whatever
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well 
 and I'm 
 I 
 I'd 
 I know it is where I work
 But I'm not sure that that's necessarily required Uh you know by law that it has to be paid 
 Uh I suspect that's a benefit of a bigger company 
 but there are certainly some that wouldn't uh 
 yeah
