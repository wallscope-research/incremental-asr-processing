 Well I haven't uh you know 
 when the war was on I watched C N N and uh NIGHTLINE pretty regularly and read the paper and all 
 but when uh 
 lately like the last week or two I guess with Easter and spring break with the kids um I hadn't been thinking much about the Middle East and what's going on over there 
 Have you been keeping up
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Start up 
 There's no official document signed or anything
 Well I um 
 when the crisis began last August well I couldn't remember things that I had studied in the past in school and all 
 so I got out like my encyclopedias and tried to read about the history
 And it was really what I felt was kind of cynical 
 because it 
 there just hasn't been any peace over there ever In thousands of years of history 
 Yeah
 That's right 
 And it's just not people 
 they 
 and it's not uh you know 
 there isn't any real Arab coalition because they do fight among themselves
 And they fight with each other 
 and they have such hatred for uh Israel 
 and 
 Oh yeah
 Um Oh no
 And got it over with 
 Well I just 
 there's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace
 And um with 
 and I'm afraid that we would have to stay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Right 
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Well I just uh 
 I'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go and call the shots like you say
 And I just would prefer that I mean sometimes we've said we're not interested in what other countries do
 And then other times we jump in and do things 
 and while I'm glad that they 
 uh I 
 it was important demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments
 I don't 
 I hope we don't try to keep uh in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to stay over there 
 because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I noticed that
 Well I don't think there's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they expect *[[Should utt 101 be included in this slash unit]]
 Yeah
 No
 No
 Well I guess I better go 
 I have a repairman just came for my refrigerator
 But 
 Yeah 
 Well I enjoyed the topic 
 I hope you have a good day
 Okay 
 Bye-bye
