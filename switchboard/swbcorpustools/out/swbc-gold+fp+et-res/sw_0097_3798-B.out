 Well uh uh that's something I've thought a lot about
 Uh I work in a hospital
 And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years 
 and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients
 Uh when they asked us did we want to uh keep it the same or uh spend more spend less uh I think right now what they're spending is adequate Uh for my personal opinion Uh because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a uh vaccine for 
 I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with
 or I think they already would have by now you know
 uh so I don't know if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now 
 I think they're doing as much research as they can possibly do you know
 And uh what about you
 I'm not either
 I'm definitely not aware of how much
 Uh that's something I've never really kept up with at all
 Uh I'm not sure uh 
 I know uh I've always thought more about the disease rather than the research 
 you know what I mean
 And uh that sort of thing 
 Uh if we were talking about the money uh I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough simply because I don't know that much about it You know 
 Oh yeah
 I think so 
 I think so 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well that's true 
 That's true because uh it's such an easily preventable disease
 Uh
 No
 It's definitely not
 That's true 
 that's true
 Uh
 Myself uh uh I'm or about to get a divorce
 and uh course I'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody I can or anything
 But it's sort of scary to find yourself single again you know
 And uh because you never know what's going to happen 
 You don't know who you're going to come across you know
 Course I'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody I see
 But it's something you got to think about these days
 A single person You know 
 and uh I mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry
 And uh 
 Certainly
 Yeah
 But uh uh I know that uh in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing you know so that uh the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything
 And uh I don't know 
 I don't think that's a bad idea
 I know it uh sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction 
 It just sort of keeps that going
 But uh I don't know 
 at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS so far cannot be You know 
 so I don't know 
 I think that's 
 I'm not too much against the passing out of the free syringes myself
 I don't know 
 what do you think about that
 [ It + *[[this "it" needs separate slash mark because B108 is an "aa" with A107 not necesarily the original intended continuation of this utt]] It ] really is
 It really is 
 They gave us a hard topic 
 Uh-huh
 That's true
 That's true
 Yeah
 You know I guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have to come first I guess as far as something to do about it
 so I don't know 
 Uh course there's so many things in the world where if you solve one problem you may be creating another you know
 uh so I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse Which is the most important to solve at the time 
 and 
 I don't know
 uh but I've never looked into how much money they're spending 
 I have no idea
 And I know a lot of our tax money goes to that
 But uh I really have never looked into it 
 I have no idea
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right 
 sure
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I think it is
 I think it is 
 Yeah 
 it does every 
 It seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do 
 it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would You know
 But uh 
 That's one thing I've never really feared
 Uh uh I 
 a lot of my family you know they fear me working like that and under some of those conditions 
 but uh uh I don't fear it at all
 Uh I work in the operating room a lot
 uh and of course when w-
