 Well how about you 
 Do you use P Cs
 Yeah 
 You and me both
 Huh-uh
 Yeah 
 And so I like the I B M P C personally
 But that's pretty much everything I've worked with 
 and uh I've become so accustomed to it that uh it's second nature
 What do you use
 Yeah
 Oh huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Oh okay
 Oh okay 
 So um we use an I B M P S two also
 And um you know every now and then the file gets so big that you know it moves slower than I'd like
 but uh I do mainly graphic work on it And uh a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it
 And uh I don't know 
 I enjoy working with them
 There's so many capabilities out there 
 I mean the things you can do are endless
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 We have one at home 
 but I just don't find the time that I can use it
 Yes
 Huh-uh
 One of the reasons why I got mine was before I went on maternity leave 
 they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because I am pretty much like you said the guru in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is
 um so they didn't know how it was going to work 
 they knew they were going to have to get a modem so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so
 But uh you know uh it's almost like we could become too dependent on them
 And oh we use a lot of free lance
 And uh that's uh pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things
 And um it 
 uh compared to the way the things have upgraded Have uh really 
 what's the word I'm looking for 
 I'm just totally drawing a blank 
 But uh the way things have changed over the years with the P C and the different programs is just great 
 It's remarkable the things we can do now and compared to you know a few years Just the power 
 I'm trying to uh get an updated machine 
 Mine uh is just putting along 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Huh-uh
 Um now that's awful
 Huh-uh
 Okay
 Oh okay
 Right
 Oh yes
 Right 
 The copy that you can with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 Um we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer
 And uh it's just so 
 the budget restraints and things like that makes it difficult 
 and uh 
 Huh-uh
 Oh huh-uh
 And we uh got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars
 Yeah 
 I don't remember what kind they were 
 but uh we do a lot of transparencies
 Sometimes the color would take too long to plot out
 So they just want black and white which see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick Because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it
 But uh it uh 
 No 
 huh-uh 
 If it was a customer presentation then that would be different
 We would want to razzle-dazzle a bit 
 But uh it's uh 
 yeah 
 We have one in the office 
 and if well in our area if we want to use it you know like you said you had to change it put it on a disc And carry it over to there and see if they're not using the printer
 Right 
 And uh wait for an opportunity to use it
 Huh-uh
 I know 
 I know 
 I understand
 Huh-uh
 Oh huh-uh
 Right
 So how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind the times in technology
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Right
 We find it or hard to understand when uh we work for a computer company and uh how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment That's obsolete 
 and some of the guys that run this place are very tight 
 and it's like Well why do we need this 
 can't you do that with you know what we have 
 and when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good
