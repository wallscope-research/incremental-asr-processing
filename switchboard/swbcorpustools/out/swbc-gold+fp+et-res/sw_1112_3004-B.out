 Well she lives in Utah 
 so 
 Yeah
 Okay 
 let's do i-
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 No 
 I don't
 I stay home most of the time 
 but I know that it's very difficult to find good help sometimes when you want your children to be taken care of
 Um you know there's a 
 my neighbor she tends children though 
 and um there's a big controversy whether they should have to um have a law to have them certified or not
 And um you know there's pros and cons on both side of that
 because if they were then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing or some kind of something to get an okay seal
 That's right 
 That's right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh now usually when I have someone tend um 
 my oldest tends for me now if I go somewhere 
 but 
 before 
 He's almost a teenager 
 Yeah 
 he's very good 
 Um but um before that I would use uh kids from our church
 and they did a good job for me 
 Um but I've never had to leave them like in a day care center or anything 
 and I've been very lucky just be able to stay home
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's hard
 Well some people aren't
 Yeah
 Oh is that right 
 I think that's really important
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Oh
 Oh uh-huh
 Oh dear
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I bet
 Uh-huh
 Well nannies have been an option uh 
 but I know that at day care they have more of a routine like maybe in uh preschool would have where they have lessons and so forth and so on 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Gave you an idea of what your child was progressing in or doing
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Oh I think so because if they were still there you know they might not
 Right 
 right
 You can't really 
 You can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something
 and usually they aren't at that age
 You know um *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 Well I know uh about three years ago I tended some children And uh you know I wondered if I would have to be certified 
 or whether they'd just bring them 
 and we got to where well we were just friends 
 and so they said no don't do that we'll just bring them
 And then if there was a problem 
 and then we'd sit down and talk about it 
 but it never happened to be a problem
 and so things worked out okay 
 and their kids played with my kids 
 and it worked out well
 Oh
 That's great
 Oh uh-huh
 Well that will be great
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I bet you'll have some great experiences with them
 Yeah
 Sure 
 why not
 and you know the grandparents uh I always hear it's always fun when you can send them home at the end of the day instead of having to *[[slash error]] So *[[slash error]] That's right
 Well uh my husband's mother lives right over here 
 and she takes care of them sometimes for me 
 and just is a lovely lady
 and I've always appreciated when she's sat with them
 And 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
