 Well we in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to uh you know keep track of uh daily finances 
 Uh uh way back what twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer I did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and you know checkbooks and all this kind of thing 
 and we kept that going for about a month 
 and it became so onerous that we gave up on it 
 You know so uh the only thing you know that we do now is uh I keep a little spread sheet of uh what I call the net worth calculation which is just the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth 
 Uh and I only update that oh I don't know maybe once every quarter or so Every three months Just basically when the statements come in You know Just to see whether or not we're you know getting ahead falling behind or staying even or what
 Uh that's really about you know the extent uh of the kind of uh financial score keeping that we're doing
 Huh 
 Oh dear that's terrible 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh I see 
 are you married 
 Are you living with people that you're sharing expenses
 Oh I see 
 uh-huh
 Oh dear
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I see
 Uh-huh 
 A- oh I see 
 Oh sure
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 you're the first you know uh 
 my next door neighbor just lost his job In you know one of these uh 
 his company I mean went you know bankrupt 
 Actually it was a subsidiary of an outfit called U S Shoe or something 
 it was a computer subsidiary 
 I don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company
 But uh you know they just folded it up and uh uh told him to 
 they took the top management and gave them jobs uh at the corporate front office 
 and everybody else was sent packing
 Uh hang on one second 
 I've got 
 uh somebody was knocking on my door here 
 Uh it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present 
 I mean it sounds terrible to say 
 but at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a budgetary thing than most people probably might be In terms of keeping score of input and output
 do you have a computer at home 
 or 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 I see
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 do you use uh a standard spread sheet 
 or I mean
