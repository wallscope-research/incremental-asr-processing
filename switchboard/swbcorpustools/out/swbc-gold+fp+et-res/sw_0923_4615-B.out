 Okay 
 Uh short term uh it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over 
 so budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much uh extra to go around 
 Uh long term is something we're starting to think about because our older child will be ready for college in [ about + uh {A gee 
 she's eight now 
 so I guess } about ] ten years
 Good heavens 
 So we're starting to think about long term considerations College and retirement 
 But with not a whole lot of discretionary money it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 And the old uh if you can't see it then you can't spend it uh idea 
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh they'll uh 
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 we actually do have some money in a Four Oh One K 
 I just wish I could afford to uh put more away each week because I agree that it's an excellent way
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be I'm convinced
 Yeah 
 I guess other than things like the stock market or mutual funds there's really not much of a return on anything these days
 Yeah 
 the interest is so low 
 I mean it's nice for people buying homes 
 but for older people who have money in C Ds or whatever it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever 
 Yeah 
 I'm with a small company now 
 and I hope uh if we're successful that they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing
 that'll be very nice
 Well I guess we're kind of running out of steam on this topic here
