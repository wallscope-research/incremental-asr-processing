 Uh invasions of privacy
 Uh what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things
 All sorts of hours calling and telling me that I want investment advise and I want this service and that service or the other thing
 Um my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen 
 just what went into the 
 something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers
 I guess in some cases they just consider pickup your phone and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not
 Um but I thought I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using 
 uh and uh businesses would be prohibited uh from calling for business selling you things
 I'm sure that's true 
 Uh some of did too 
 I think government can do that now
 is that right
 And uh especially with possibly children around
 Uh that could be useful protection
 So uh I used to deal with 
 What are dialing services
 Oh oh where people just call you
 you know and then those problems has been eliminated 
 those problems used to be when I used a credit card they'd want to have my phone number
 And I did not like giving it out 
 I gave out my work number
 but I think I'm not sure if it's by law just 
 otherwise I think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number
 How did Radio Shack work 
 Yes 
 that's one solution 
 but you nonetheless often get people calling you
 Despite the fact that your number is unlisted
 And you actually have your number 
 or are they just calling a number that happens to be yours
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers
 I'll be thinking in mind the address is 
 um is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number
 Huh Yeah 
 I don't know 
 I think it's gotten much worse the last few years 
 Maybe that's just because I've gotten on more lists
 Yeah 
 Sell you magazines 
 Uh-huh 
 I guess whatever is 
 I just don't give
