 Now we're ready 
 Do you have a personal computer
 You do in your home
 I do not have one in my home 
 I use one all day at work 
 but I don't have one at home
 Do you find you use it a lot
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 What kind do you have
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well that sounds interesting
 I have a P S one I B M type
 Uh and I use it all day at work 
 and I put all my personal stuff on it at work 
 So I really haven't had a need for one at home 
 but probably if I didn't have access to one all the time at work I'd want one at home
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 What is that tracking the flights and things
 Uh
 They tell us when we're through
 They come in and tell us 
 Have you just started doing this
 Oh really
 They'll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now 
 and it's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that
 It's not more than five min- 
 But I'm going to ignore that 
 That's a call on my other line 
 so I'm just going to ignore it 
 But 
 It's kind of a hassle when you have this 
 but other times it 
 I work at Texas Instruments
 Yes
 I sure do
 Well no 
 I'm doing this at home 
 I'm already home for the day
 you know I can't do it at work 
 I work in the legal department 
 so I'm pretty busy
 But I use my P C there mostly for creating legal documents 
 We use Word Perfect Lotus
 Uh
 Yeah 
 it's really 
 I love Lotus
 I think that's about my favorite
 Uh-huh
 It really is 
 and I know there's still a hundred things I don't know how to do on it
 But uh you know you learn something every time you use it
 Uh-huh
 You can 
 did they give you a number to call
 You can start calling in whenever it's convenient for you 
 but you can only make one call a day
 Yeah 
 if you've talked to someone like you're talking to me now and I place the call this counts as your call
 So you cannot make a call now until tomorrow
 No 
 we both do
 Didn't they ask you for your I D number when you answered
 Okay 
 so you both do
 From what I understand 
 It's for research
 It's a research type project on uh voice activated electronics you know
 To uh 
 it's uh 
 well they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 They're doing research for a lot of big companies from what I understand on this 
 Now I don't know everything about it 
 but they uh try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this 
 and that way they can check voice patterns
 Uh-huh 
 and get the computer where it recognizes voices
 Well I probably do because I've 
 Well I was born and raised in Texas 
 Have lived here forever 
 so I probably do
 I'm in Richardson 
 It's right outside of Dallas
 Uh-huh
 Well Richardson's right between Dallas and Plano
 You probably did
 Uh-huh
 Well what are you doing way in Washington
 Uh-huh
 Well that's interesting
 Uh-huh 
 So I imagine they use personal computers
 Do they do their correspondence on it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
