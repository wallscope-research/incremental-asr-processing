 Okay 
 Do you have a budget that you go on
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Well my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be
 Each month they are more or less just about the same you know
 Uh very seldom are they any different 
 And then uh like for groceries and everything we try to put like two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen 
 and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with
 And then we put our receipts in there you know 
 and usually that's enough
 uh but I don't have any you know small children to have anything extra come up you know like uh running to the doctor or something like that with them
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 right 
 In fact I did have to take my dog to the vet the other day 
 Yeah 
 it's worse than having a kid huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 uh I'm not working right now 
 I worked for P I E 
 and then uh they went bankrupt 
 so I just went ahead and took my early pension
 But I only get that once a month
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 So 
 Yeah 
 So you know I really have to try to budget that I don't go over that amount you know each month
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 right
 Uh-huh
 And 
 Oh yeah 
 Right now it's terrible isn't it
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 I also like long-term Christmas club you know 
 I used to belong to a Christmas club 
 last year I didn't
 so then naturally Christmas comes along 
 and that puts you behind too you know 
 So this year now I have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my checking account for my Christmas club
 So I figure you know that's going to help some
 Yeah 
 right you know
 Right 
 right 
 And I'm ta- 
 Oh that's good 
 I'm taking like uh sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what I can
 so I won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore
 I know 
 I even bought myself a Surgery you know 
 and I just love it 
 I haven't learned everything to do on it yet 
 but I figure that will help me save you know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well see some people are some aren't 
 because I have three sisters 
 and none of those are really interested in sewing
 Yeah 
 and then I can also you know do some crafts and sell those at garage sales
 So which I've been doing
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Oh
 Well have you called 
 Oh 
 Oh it is
 Oh well that's nice you know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well I guess that's about all I can talk to about budgets 
 When I was working I uh bought a bond a month out of my you know 
 they automatically took it out of my payroll
