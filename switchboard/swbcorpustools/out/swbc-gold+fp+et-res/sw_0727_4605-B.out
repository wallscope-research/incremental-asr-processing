 Hi <>
 Sort of 
 I'm a student 
 but uh I'm in the National Guard 
 and they do a little bit of drug testing
 Yeah
 Uh they do it before you go in/
 and occasionally they'll have a random urinalysis
 Yeah 
 So you can't be smoking marijuana in the military anymore 
 Oh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I believe they should too
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 definitely
 Oh 
 Uh 
 But after you 
 you have to do randomly otherwise people will cheat
 Yeah
 They 
 I know when I was doing my uh basic training in A I T there was guys who would fool around 
 and then when that urinalysis came around they would be all scared 
 So it does work it is effective
 *[[ 2 slash units ]] The only problem is you know if you have done drugs but you've stopped and uh you do get caught it is kind of harsh
 Yeah
 Uh we get counseling 
 and uh I think part of our pay is docked if we're first time offenders
 I really don't 
 I haven't 
 I don't do any drugs 
 so I don't know
 Crazy 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 wastes your future
 Yeah
 Uh what do you think about our uh like uh other government agencies testing 
 Do you think our government agencies should test
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh I know 
 yeah 
 They aren't 
 Yeah 
 Right now it's too lucrative for the drug dealers 
 so the risks are worth it for them
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Oh see that's 
 tha- 
 it is a problem 
 Sometimes some medicines will give off a false positive
 I've heard of that 
 yeah
 Yeah
 I believe you should have the testing/
 but they should be like if you get a positive they should double check you and still give you the benefit of a doubt
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Well it was nice talking to you Rose
 Okay 
 Bye-bye
