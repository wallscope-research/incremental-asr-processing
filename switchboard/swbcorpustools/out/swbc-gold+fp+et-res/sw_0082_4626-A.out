 Okay 
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 Well I feel like uh I am from Mars 
 I mean I'm fifty years old 
 and uh I've been divorced for um eighteen years 
 But I've two kids and all 
 But I've never had a budget 
 and I don't uh do any planning 
 and I don't know
 uh uh I don't have a long-term financial plan 
 I don't try to control my expenses
 But I'm glad you're a stranger
 But really well I'm curious how other people live 
 Uh so maybe we should start with you 
 What do you do
 Really
 Oh 
 Maybe they're going to arrest us both
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh The uh 
 I had a part-time job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy-six
 and uh uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time 
 and so I was willing to take a half time job to do that 
 And I actually did 
 my bank account would uh 
 I kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month 
 but I had miscalculated 
 well I didn't keep a balance 
 It's one of the problems <>
 I never had to in the past
 I always kept plenty of money in my checking account 
 but when you're only earning half the salary Even though I wasn't spending much money I sometimes would just 
 things would get to tight 
 Uh and sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet 
 and every time uh I spent money I mean cash mostly I would uh write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning
 But I would forget to write the things down 
 and I don't know if I ever went as far as three months or not in keeping that kind of data 
 I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 The uh 
 I have to say that 
 let's see at this point on I don't run out of money 
 Uh and it uh 
 and I don't I mean 
 someday if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have 
 and I think my strategy if I may is to not spend money 
 I mean I don't have expensive tastes 
 I don't go out 
 I mean I buy a car 
 well the last car I got rid of I'd had 
 it was nineteen years old
 people were embarrassed for me 
 I mean it was a good car 
 and 
 Oh it was great 
 my mechanics loved it because it was a sixty-five Buick 
 and it just wouldn't stop 
 Uh and it 
 I just didn't feel the need for a new car 
 It isn't like I couldn't afford one
 Uh and now I mean I don't uh 
 I tend to eat expensive food 
 I mean I don't mind buying a good steak 
 but for me I only do that every week or I mean maybe once a month
 I mean you buy a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound 
 You buy a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars 
 To me I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that
 but I'm just saying as a single person that's a drop in the bucket 
 And so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up I mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which I don't care to go to
 so that's I think one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that I don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it because I'm not interested in that expensive thing
