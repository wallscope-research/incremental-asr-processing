 Oh uh let's see 
 uh I have enjoyed uh THIRTYSOMETHING in the past uh now that it has gone off 
 Uh some comedy shows uh I can not think of off hand
 but what are your 
 what is 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 uh yeah 
 yeah 
 [ we try to catch that most nights
 Yeah
 it was kind of interesting uh some people complained about uh uh the kind of whining or whatever on it 
 I really did not think it was that way 
 I think it had some uh good situations that it presented
 Yeah
 Well I think a lot of people you know kind of felt that way 
 but they had a lot of uh uh counseling groups that use some of the episodes as examples of things that were going on 
 and uh you know that they called interaction between people and sort of to use as uh as a way of getting people to talk about their problems
 and that sort of thing 
 Uh we kind of 
 uh our T V viewing has uh slowed down a little bit since our daughter came along 
 so uh 
 that tends to uh put a cramp in your viewing because by the time you get through getting her ready for bed and everything uh it's uh very little T V time left
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's right
 No 
 I can not uh 
 *[[typo cannot]] I don't think there were Uh 
 uh uh there are not as many good shows that I continuously like to watch as much as I used to 
 I uh you know 
 uh I used to be able to name ten shows or so you know that I felt were worth my time to watch 
 but uh I uh you know very seldom like to watch you know those 
 there's a couple now that I tend to want to watch 
 I like uh home improvement shows like Bob Vela's uh HOME AGAIN on Saturday morning
 I notice it's like THIS OLD HOUSE 
 yeah 
 but uh it's on 
 instead of being on P B S it's on regular T V
 But uh it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house 
 and 
 Yeah 
 so I like to watch that 
 and uh some things on P B S I like to watch 
 but uh 
 Yeah 
 if it's a team or something that I am really interested in I am not one to just watch a football game just to be watching it 
 or I am not a big basketball or baseball fan unless it's baseball if it's a team I really like I may watch 
 but uh baseball to me is a little hard to watch on T V for an extended period
 Yeah 
 it's so slow that you just get bored you know 
 I will switch between something else and a baseball game going back and forth you know watching it 
 But I usually 
 if it's a football team I really like a college team or pro team that I am fond of I usually will sit and watch that 
 But uh that's the 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 it's kind of like baseball 
 Right 
 I think that that's what more people are doing 
 and I think that's you know 
 as T V 
 I think the less good shows being on T V has caused a lot of people to do that uh you know get more movies and watch
 I know we have done that too in the past uh 
 we do not do it quite as much now cause our baby will not let us watch them
 But uh you know we used to rent uh two or three movies on a weekend and try to watch
 No uh
 we live in 
 No 
 No 
 we uh 
 the uh development we moved into was 
 they have it on one si- like right across the street from us 
 but when they built our section did not put it in 
 and we have been there about two years now
 and they still do not have it 
 so I am hoping that soon they will 
 I have contacted them about this 
 and they say that well it's 
 they look 
 every year they look at uh different areas and try to determine where uh the most houses will be
 and so uh they look 
 and when we reach a certain number of people in that area they will put some in or they will at least consider it 
 so 
 Yeah 
 Um Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I put in uh an antenna a really good antenna 
 and uh it's really helped you know ours 
 and it's not been too bad 
 I have not really missed it that much 
 there's certain things that I have that I want to see you know occasionally like a football game a college game or something that happens to be on cable or some old movie 
 but the uh 
 I have not been bothered by it too much
 So 
 Right
 Okay
 Alright 
 bye
