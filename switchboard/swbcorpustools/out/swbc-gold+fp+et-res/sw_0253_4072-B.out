 Um well actually usually uh in the mornings I am getting ready to either go to work uh 
 usually catch the news in the morning
 Uh N B C
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I usually tend to just you know rely on you know T V uh again you know just through the grapevine just to know like you know like what today's stories are 
 and I usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know I'm interested in any particular one
 Yeah 
 I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all
 Well what I really don't like about T V especially local news as compared to like national news is just uh it seems like everything is very spoon feed 
 and you know it's more like the news shows is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports you know is you're kids bus driver smoking crack on the way to school you know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 also I have the observation uh with the press that like any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for you know anything that actually had more than just a blurb about it the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story
 it's something wrong
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 the farm report
 Uh-huh 
 Also I have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television 
 Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down 
 and 
 Was that like he started shooting people in this cafeteria or something
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 I have seen that happen lots of times 
 You know uh Channel X gives you the best coverage 
 you know we were on the scene with our team players 
 and 
 Uh-huh <>
 Uh-huh <>
 Uh-huh
 They are trying to get the you know most emotional response for 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 You know I've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know
 uh you know even the national news I just find it to be you know very watered down 
 very 
 Uh I found it very one sided
 Uh you know it just seemed to lack any sort of debate
 Uh you know not saying that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there 
 but it just seemed like you know 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and I really think that you know in the involvement that the press states you know the military basically sets the press
