 I haven't uh talked to anybody outside the Metroplex 
 so I didn't even think of saying Arlington Texas
 This is a real first 
 Are you at work
 I've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening 
 and I thought well I'm not having any luck 
 I'll try the middle of the afternoon
 I am too 
 Well do you have any uh opinion on the subject
 Democracy
 Oh
 Oh sure 
 uh we hear a little of the news Uh 
 yeah 
 I have heard about that the last couple of days 
 how big is the Ukraine the area 
 do you know
 Or a population or anything 
 I'm really uninformed
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Oh I see 
 oh I didn't really know that 
 I know a lot of oh their countries that they had overtaken or wanted to be independent or several of them right
 And uh what about Astonia 
 are they 
 Right 
 I thought they were
 but the Ukraine is especially significant because of the agriculture
 Uh so there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could
 No 
 they don't
 And Bush has already given his opinion on it right
 Didn't I read that
 So now uh not that may matter 
 I don't know anymore 
 I uh fear for the Russians from what I read you know 
 I wonder how they're going to get through the winter Food wise or any wise 
 sounds to me like they'll start rioting soon or not that that would do any good 
 but I guess people do that when they're desperate
 Well that's true 
 since the Depression 
 I guess when the veterans went to Washington 
 and well you know the war riots of course 
 Let's just hope we don't get to that point 
 Things are not so good in Texas job wise
 Well we do 
 We have lots and lots of uh layoffs here Lot of companies folding lot of layoffs 
 and it's pretty scary
 Well I don't understand economics that well 
 I don't know 
 I know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't
 and so I assume that that has Or a great effect 
 And uh I mean they said during the way Reagan-Bush years the rich got richer 
 the poor got poorer 
 the statistics prove that 
 so uh I guess 
 Well I really don't know 
 I think uh maybe they contributed to it 
 Maybe they should pay more attention or you know to the more equalization of the trade 
 Of course if somebody in China can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions well I don't know what's going to happen then
 Right
 And child labor
 Right 
 Well I don't know 
 What do you think has caused our horrible situation
 One thing
 Right 
 well they say too that having a democratic congress and republican President is not good 
 I mean I've read that is a theory
 Well I hate to say it 
 but I'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party
 Uh
 Oh I know 
 it used to 
 right 
 Well you don't want too many democrats anymore 
 and for a while I kind of deserted the party 
 but now it's looking better to me
 Oh do you 
 Oh I'm glad to hear that
 Well I think so too 
 I just admire her a lot
 And uh I really hope she does well 
 But she's uh you know probably more popular out of the state than she is here although she did manage to win
 But look who she was running against you know 
 He shot himself in the foot so many times 
 How did you get on this T I thing
