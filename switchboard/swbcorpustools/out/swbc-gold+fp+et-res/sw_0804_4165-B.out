 Well ourselves we have I guess never had to look for child care
 Our kids are now fourteen and eighteen
 uh and so you know you go back those many years and uh we didn't do it very much
 I guess we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at uh two family income at the time 
 And our kids were older 
 But I've had to deal with uh you know friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing
 Uh so it 
 my involvement hasn't been direct 
 but still have been you know certainly exposed to criteria people are using
 How about yourself
 Right 
 Right 
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I kind of think that uh you know some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care
 But even you know here I guess we have in one sense two forms of uh child care 
 There's where individuals will in one primarily babysit children in their own home 
 And that will be groups of anywhere <> from one or two to maybe seven or eight children
 And then otherwise there will be 
 the majority are co-operative day-cares 
 Uh people form a co-op and uh parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours 
 Frequently they will hire staff to be at the day-care 
 and the emphasis is primarily uh someplace for the children to be 
 But at the same time there's some fairly good training programs and some of them formal two year programs
 Uh so that 
 you know there is some definite uh creative play good social interaction that kind of thing
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 You know we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here
 and I guess you know it are 
 it's uh typically uh whether it's been child care in a home or in a larger situation where actually it's more of an institution 
 And you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children 
 and it's more of a group home rather than actually day-care type of facility 
 Uh
