 Okay 
 I've got a you know 
 I have a real good method of starting to get the budget balancing 
 and then that's get rid of the half of the government payroll
 Not all 
 you know I don't know if you've ever been to Washington D C
 Uh you've seen that which was on there and the offices 
 and in light of these uh hearings we've all been sitting through the last two weeks we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed
 They really don't have enough to keep them busy to keep their noses in their own business of what they're doing
 And the other thing is uh besides that I think uh two things that very definitely need looking at one is foreign aid 
 I have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us
 I find that a total waste and part of the defense budget 
 Uh again being just a voter and a taxpayer you know working through our congressman I don't think there's too much that I'm going to be able to do about it 
 but I believe in taking an active part in politics 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 they don't seem to well 
 I really think the biggest problem 
 and then the Taft-Rudman Act is supposed to help that 
 The biggest part is they have no accountability for what they're doing
 I mean this nonsense that's coming through now about uh uh lowering payments on Social Security and a few other things that Bush has in mind in order to boost the economy because people have more money as it's ridiculous
 If they don't have that money now bringing in less is not going to help the problem as far as the government
 No
 Yeah 
 and thank God we don't operate our budget the way they operate theirs or we'd all be in dire trouble
 But that's uh 
 yeah 
 I don't know what we're going to be able to do about it 
 but I guess it's sitting around so long that it's sort of like our mortgages 
 I don't ever expect to pay mine off before I die 
 so I guess why should the government 
 Isn't 
 that's the way they're thinking these days anyway
 I don't think it ever will really 
 I 
 maybe if they ever get to the point you know the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense
 Really 
 If they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic you know intergovernmental or inter United States like programs that one really might
 I believe in paying my share 
 and I don't mind uh paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to 
 But I just sometimes feel like I'm being used 
 But uh again I don't think we'll be able to do anything about it 
 so 
 Yeah 
 Bite the bullet 
 It sounds like you have a baby there
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Oh that's a shame 
 She's not the one going to Washington huh
 Oh 
 Okay 
 Okay Geri 
 We've probably been on long enough
 They didn't cut us off 
 but I think that will probably do it 
 so it was nice talking to you
 Okey-doke
 Bye-bye
