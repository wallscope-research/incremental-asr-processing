 Well let me just start by asking what you think of this Middle East affair we've got going on
 I have to agree with you there 
 uh I think that uh for once we shouldn't even be at these Mid East talks because with the exception of our hostages we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding who's land it is 
 Just let these people fight it out
 you know we've got so many domestic problems 
 and what does it cost these people over there you know
 Oh so how about the Soviet Union 
 What do you think's going to happen there 
 The break ups
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 that's right
 Well all I've seen 
 Reagan obviously wasn't too concerned with the domestic side of his political affairs 
 I think Bush's kind of followed suit 
 Um international is important 
 but uh we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed 
 Uh you know and then there's the homeless issue 
 and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without uh hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations I think 
 and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending
 Right
 I agree 
 We've been writing off way too many uh country bad debts Exactly
 I know it
 Right
 That's right 
 you're either liberal or you're conservative
 Well I think uh it wouldn't hurt 
 and I know the Independent Party's been trying for years to get a real force uh in Congress 
 but uh you're right 
 there's just too many issues that come up that uh our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a Democratic issue or it's a Republican issue
 and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel I think uh we might have a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed
 He's one of the two huh
 Well let's see 
 Senators are in for six years right
 and uh when did you guys vote him into office
 Oh you're stuck
