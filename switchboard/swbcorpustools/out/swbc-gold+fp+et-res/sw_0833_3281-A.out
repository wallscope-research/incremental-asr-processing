 Okay Diane 
 And a very good afternoon to you
 Do you uh do most of your cooking at home 
 or do you uh have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them
 Uh-huh 
 My goodness 
 Well what would you uh like to cook 
 what is your favorite uh recipes uh that you would like to have for a dinner party 
 Now you're in Dallas is it
 Okay
 I was thinking in terms of Mexican almost Tex-Mex 
 Uh-huh
 Well that's a very interesting food though 
 and when I go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of foods I like to find
 We have uh 
 I think som- Chico's 
 or in these different restaurants in this area that uh have all this fine Mexican foods 
 But um if I were to cook uh a dinner party uh it may be standard to you 
 but uh actually I never get too much fried chicken
 But I would have fried chicken uh with reasonably hot sauce on it Almost a Mexican type thing 
 And I love twice cooked potatoes 
 Have you ever had twice cooked potatoes with a cream made of the sour cream and cream cheese and uh a little oleo and I use uh oregano and maybe dill weed uh mixed in with it
 And uh I like broccoli casseroles which would include onion and cheese and more dill weed and some medium hot peppers 
 As you can see I'm inclined towards the Mexican type of a meal 
 And I would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too
 So uh how would you improve upon that
 More fresh vegetables
 Included to that
 Uh-huh
 How do you cook your green beans
 Uh-huh
 So you h- 
 All right that's what I was wondering about 
 what you use and in herbs and so forth
 Uh-huh
 Have you ever tried Chinese type green beans
 We use soy sauce
 Well you might uh be interested in that 
 Have 
 it gives a very delicious taste 
 you have a soy sauce taste 
 and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you would use the uh water and 
 uh golly What's this white powder uh that you mix with water and gives a thick sauce 
 I can't even think of the name of that right at the moment
 Anyhow 
 sorry about my mind
 But uh it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans
 and then you have a nice soy sauce taste under it with a few onions in there with it 
 If it does 
 it brings out so much different things uh in the string beans 
 I like it to try them differently 
 I hardly ever cook them the same way twice Just so I can enjoy them 
 So you might uh think about that
 Chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them
 And uh north African cooking is good when you use something called couscous
 And that's uh made from uh I think they call it beans 
 And that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous uh absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it where that makes a very delicious dish 
 You probably have to buy that from specialty stores
 C o u s c o u s 
 And that's a north African dish 
 They eat it one to two meals everyday in north Africa 
 And it is very very flexible 
 You can do a lot of things with it 
 It makes a fantastic uh uh salad with cucumbers and olive oil and onions 
 and 
 Oh boy 
 real tasty 
 Well I've enjoyed talking with you 
 and I hope I've given you some ideas
 and uh that's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food
 Well thank you very much Miss Diane
 Bye-bye
