 Do you like Mexican 
 Do you like Mexican food
 Oh
 Well I mean there's so many places here you know 
 it's just lots of good Mexican restaurants here
 But in the Addison well about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area anyway
 I mean now there's a new Italian place Sfuzi
 I've not been there but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas 
 and now there's one in Addison
 it's S F U Z I 
 And it's in Addison 
 and it's a great place 
 Also a great place that they have like Cajun food is Copelands
 Now I really like Copelands
 Oh yeah the I know 
 no 
 I don't like that place
 See uh uh 
 yeah 
 when I went I thought the food was not good
 Magic Time Machine is the place you're thinking of
 See when I went I thought 
 the people drove me crazy first of all
 but then I just thought the food was over priced for what it was
 Do you like Southwestern
 Well now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill that's on Belt Line that's close to Houston's as a matter of fact
 And um it's great 
 I mean they have I think 
 sometimes I've been when I thought Well it wasn't as good 
 but I went there recently 
 and I thought Well this really is good
 So that's a very good place to eat The Blue Mesa Grill
