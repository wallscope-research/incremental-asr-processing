 Okay 
 we're rolling 
 I uh 
 what has your experience lead you to advise uh if my child were thinking of going to the Air Force Academy 
 what would you say
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 How do you feel about 
 it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college 
 How does that uh 
 how do you feel that is for someone at that phase in their life
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I sort of 
 one of the reasons it's taken so long is I've been working you know sort of half working and source of income and stuff 
 so I'm actually managing to do this with zero debt
 Uh you couldn't do it otherwise
 Yeah 
 I think if there's any major piece of advice is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt
 It's not 
 I mean I remember seeing an article one time about you know if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in an investment fund they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the job they'd get after college
 So it's really kind of crazy
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Huh
 Yes 
 yes 
 I know
 I was thinking of trying to get a job there 
 I heard of it
 Uh-uh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well my real feeling about the purpose of undergraduate education is it's really the time 
 yes 
 you do get an education you do learn some things 
 but you eventually forget most of it
 But what you don't forget is the growing up 
 It's really the period when people become adults 
 I mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways 
 But really 
 it's the entry into adulthood I think 
 And I think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to be fostered in you know as you gain new social skills as you become you know more of a functioning member of society 
 And maybe the Air Force Academy is a perfect 
 as you said for someone you know you know who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them
 Yeah
 and want to develop that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 The same patterns of behavior you mean
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Exactly 
 I find it kind of sad 
 I really do
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems
 Yeah 
 the one thing I think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions 
 These institutions of thirty thousand students and such
 And I see some freshmen wandering around in there 
 and they're just like you know someone from the country lost in the big city 
 I mean they 
 I don't see them getting 
 I mean when I was undergraduate I went to a relatively small school for my first two years 
 and then I transferred to a very large school
 And that worked out pretty well 
 I went from you know a second rate institution to a higher rate institution
 But the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was 
 I needed to make friends 
 I needed to sort of learn the ropes 
 You know there were things like that that mattered a lot more 
 and I needed really simple education that you can get pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 exactly 
 And if you're alienated 
 I mean I see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having psychological problems that you think this isn't sinking in
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 it's sort of a rare select environment
 Yeah
 Right 
 right 
 sure
 Yeah 
 It's a top rated institution 
 and now I 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well I had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school Not realizing that the reputation for M I T is because of the doctorate research and the professors who go there 
 and you're not going to see the professors
 you know you're going to see some T A you know 
 Uh so you know they want the best 
 and they think what the best is is reputation for research 
 and that's a one standard 
 but it's not relevant to what they need
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Yeah 
 you won't get that at M I T virtually or anything like that
 you know and you can't blame the professors either because you look at their job description 
 you'd s- you know 
 teaching is third down on the list of importance things 
 and 
 yeah 
 and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time
 So I'd say go to a college that has teachers 
 People who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job
 But oh well 
 Uh-huh
