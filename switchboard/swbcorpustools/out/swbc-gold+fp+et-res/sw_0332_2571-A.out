 All right
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Really 
 I think that 
 I don't know 
 I don't think our prison system isn't set up where we um rehabilitate or you know restore anybody 
 I think it'll only make them worse 
 but I believe that God can come in and change a person's heart and genuinely change it 
 but that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow 
 And if you do kill a person and you know you're found to be guilty I believe God establishes the authority of our court system 
 and I do believe that capital punishment is uh alternative 
 Even you know God can still change your heart 
 but that doesn't mean 
 like the alcoholic that charges up all the bills on the credit card or the shopaholic you know you get your life right with God 
 but you still have to pay your Visa bill
 You still have to you know 
 but God sent us his grace 
 and they give pardons 
 but I believe if it's a genuine conversion there's a genuine 
 and those prison people they know a genuine turnaround in a person's character 
 they see that
 And I worked in a prison in Fort Worth
 Yeah 
 I have a degree in social work 
 You see it you know the ones that have a genuine character change
 It is obvious 
 And they know that 
 they're not going to pardon someone from the governor 
 you know what I'm saying 
 they're not going to go without going through every channel of authority in the prison 
 So I feel like you know there is occasions where they do spare lives 
 and you know I leave that with the governor who of course is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected 
 so 
 Uh-huh 
 Punishment 
 Yeah 
 that's okay
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 but in the Old Testament 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 Right 
 we don't 
 well yeah 
 we definitely have lost the Judeo-Christian ethic of the judicial system for sure 
 but the foundation is still there though of the system 
 but I know what you're saying uh 
 but also they're under a law because we haven't been removed from the law 
 we've just been taken out from under a law 
 Because under the law if your child back talks you he would be stoned
 under the law he would be stoned 
 so we've been removed from being under the law 
 but you know we're still accountable to it 
 We don't need to back talk 
 but you know it's like God changes your heart to not do that 
 He changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust 
 Because in the Old Testament they could look all they wanted just couldn't do it 
 But in the new he's looking at your heart 
 and so I guess that's what I mean by their character changes and you know what I mean it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart what's the character showing me here 
 and then any of 
 see if I don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree that this person needs to be excused I believe for murder uh rape I even believe incest things that will permanently damage uh the character of the child 
 I believe crimes against children should be punished by death I believe sexual crimes unless there's a true change of character 
 And that's where we just have to trust the authorities 
 And they're not going to excuse people if it was run like that 
 I don't 
 there would probably be very few exceptions to that 
 and if it was done quickly and done swiftly 
 but it's not because the judicial system they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 Anybody 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 Right
 I think it's Jamaica I know that they have you know crimes punishable by death 
 and I'm sure they hit a few every now and then 
 and I wouldn't want to be one of them that are not guilty 
 But I know that they have like uh their crime rate 
 it's not Jamaica 
 I don't think 
 I can't remember which 
 it's uh one of the Caribbean Islands 
 and Singapore is it like that 
 My husband's going Singapore 
 And they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law 
 and the law is enforced 
 And that's when you have lawlessness 
 I mean the law's not being enforced 
 and all that does is lawlessness 
 we went on a mission trip to Manhattan and to the Bronx and stuff two years ago 
 and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack 
 and everyone was out 
 uh we were across from that big bus station 
 I forget what you call it 
 but anyway and they had like fifteen people lined up on the fence 
 and within two hours there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing
 And you'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days
 Because the answer is not being given to them in the court system 
 and I think initially when our country was set up it was set up with God 
 and it was really an integral part 
 and no 
 you can't force people 
 but I think people are hurting 
 and they're out doing crack sitting on the street 
 They were the kind of people that 
 I think mostly we would want to receive it 
 If it was presented to see 
 I don't know 
 I guess I'm kind of frustrated that you know we've gotten away from the Christian basis that our court system was founded upon 
 I mean it reeks of the BIBLE just the whole system 
 And so I feel like if that was presented more openly and not just relying upon para-church ministry to come in and do it that the system itself 
 you know what I mean
 I feel like that might be better if it was run on a more scriptural basis which would include you know you know and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with
 Right 
 Right
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 I know you're right 
 they would lobby that 
 and I see that 
 and that's why you know I'm like okay what's my role in this thing you know what's my part 
 because I don't think the system is going to get fixed 
 I think it's crippled
