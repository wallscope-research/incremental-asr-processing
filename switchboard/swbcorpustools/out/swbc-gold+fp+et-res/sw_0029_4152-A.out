 Well anyway uh I uh oh 
 yeah 
 I did forget to ask you 
 What is your name by the way
 Oh you're Ann 
 Hi 
 But uh anyway I uh 
 lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good change if we're going to be talking about the subject tonight which in some I guess criminal courts the 
 Yeah 
 the one of which was uh something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town 
 uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race Uh
 Yeah 
 Well the people that 
 uh the jury that's trying uh the officers in that case is an all white panel 
 And there's been a lot made in the local papers of that fact 
 They have 
 They have 
 They moved it up to the county north of here
 Um it's in Ventura 
 and there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously 
 and it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because uh that 
 Yeah 
 It was everywhere
 So you know 
 and I think it would be very difficult to uh find a panel that would not have seen it and known of what was going on
 Exactly 
 You know um the you know 
 I'm kind of torn on this issue 
 It's like they're saying well on the one hand he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways I think true 
 But on the other hand it's also saying that white jurors are not going to convict
 Uh you know they're not going to do their job Which is 
 the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or uh let go based on whether or not the evidence says that there's enough 
 Um 
 They well 
 I guess it depends on who you talk to 
 uh I haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it 
 but I rather imagine there's some snickering about it And a lot of the usually fatalistic uh here we go again folks kind of stuff 
 No 
 no 
 I you know 
 you know on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy Um
 Uh-huh
 Well 
 Yeah Um 
 I don't know You know 
 and again there's uh something else along those lines 
 There was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins 
 I don't know if it's got as much notoriety 
 but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was with uh the Rodney King problem 
 Um a girl walked into a Korean owned store 
 and uh she had a dispute black girl
 she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the owner of the store 
 The owner of the store popped her
 Yeah 
 and oh of course they 
 you know the criminal case went up 
 and the judge gave the woman who shot the girl uh uh practically a suspended sentence 
 I mean it was just 
 she gave her no time in jail you know all of these things 
 and then oh we have people wondering around with petitions trying to get the judge 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it would make life easier
 Yeah 
 But
