 Okay 
 Well I'm a Vietnam era veteran 
 and uh I was uh fortunate not to have to serve in the theater 
 however my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation Uh 
 I'm of the old school that believes that uh the uh uh contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored 
 However uh I think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker Uh 
 but those are my personal thoughts 
 and I think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run World War Two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people 
 But as it was the politicians ran the Korean conflict and ultimately the Vietnam thing 
 and we managed to come out uh losers all the way around 
 And so this is what ultimately triggered us uh United States uh per se uh deciding to get out of the role of world policeman 
 Your views 
 Well
 We got into it because of SEATO agreement back just right after World War Two that uh we pledged a mutual uh uh defense of the South Vietnamese 
 and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another 
 and really we 
 I question us you know now 
 of course hindsight is all too clear
 Uh so we have to deal with the uh situation as we played it
 I 
 don't get me started on those people 
 You know before Jane Fonda did what she did I thought she was a wonderful person 
 but after uh uh well 
 I just don't want anything to do with her any more 
 because uh you support your government
 Uh okay 
 right or wrong 
 I don't think we can determine whether we were right or wrong 
 because you're having to deal with again uh 
 I think we could have made a different agreement back in the late forties era that would have kept of there
 Can you hold just a second Terry
 One moment please
 Sorry for the delay
 Uh yeah 
 this is 
 the uh mutual defense thing was uh 
 we 
 it was complicated 
 and I don't think everybody knows the whole situation 
 I don't 
 But from what I can gather is we went and said yeah we will help the South Vietnamese uh should they ask 
 Well the French went in and tried their old style warfare and uh got soundly thrashed 
 And we didn't do a whole lot better
 Well yeah 
 that was the old French colony but see the French were our uh allies in NATO
 and they're also our allies in SEATO which was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization which has since been uh disbanded as far as I know 
 you know NATO is on the way of being disbanded Uh 
 but uh you know the French yeah 
 we go in as an ally to the French and says yeah we'll help you out if you get in a bind 
 Well they got in a bind and says we don't want to you know play any more
 so uh we kind of got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly uh um oh operations and then the you know full scale troops et cetera et cetera et cetera
 Uh yeah 
 yeah 
 roughly
