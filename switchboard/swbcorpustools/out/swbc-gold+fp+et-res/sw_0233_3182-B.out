 Yes 
 I do
 China painting and ceramics
 I enjoy it 
 Uh-huh <>
 I enjoy the china more
 And now that I have my eyes corrected to the point that I can see the delicate part of china painting I do enjoy it
 My husband kept begging me 
 and he's been dead now for twenty years 
 so you understand that this was a long time ago 
 But he finally brought me the china the book the brushes and he said I have made arrangements for your lessons
 And I said I'll do it for three months 
 and if I don't like it that's it 
 Well I painted an awful lot until his death which was several years 
 And it has just been the most relaxing enjoyable self-satisfying thing I've had 
 I 
 I have sold quite a bit 
 I give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home 
 and then I just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it 
 Uh-huh
 I have just retired
 Yes
 No 
 it's not
 It's a great hobby 
 but don't retire 
 Oh
 Oh have well 
 Wow
 Oh uh-huh
 Well my sister is the seamstress of the two of us 
 but she doesn't china paint 
 so we both have our expertise side
 What part of Ohio are you in
 Oh what's that 
 If you ever start be sure and start with I mean a large flat plate 
 Um that way you can get the feel of 
 you're not cramped on these smaller objects
 That's right
 In Abilene Texas
 She just taught china painting 
 Uh-huh 
 and 
 then we had so much fun there 
 I had a friend from Albany which is about thirty-six miles away 
 and we would meet every Thursday morning at our instructor's home because she did our firing for us 
 and she would help us 
 and we bought lots of equipment from her supplies 
 and it was just such a delightful time 
 And then after I 
 Beg pardon
 I have been a little bit negligent about it because I was so tired when I had to go to work after my husband's death 
 So I have put it aside for a little while 
 but I have just found me an instructor to get started again 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Of course I just have one beautiful with peonies uh umbrella stand 
 and I have two daughters 
 and they're both
