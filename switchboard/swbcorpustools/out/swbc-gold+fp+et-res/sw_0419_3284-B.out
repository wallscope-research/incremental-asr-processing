 Uh yes 
 I think so Uh
 Yeah 
 I don't kn- 
 Yeah 
 I believe that's right
 uh and I don't know that that's really what we're talking about
 Yeah 
 for kids in high school it could be in the summertime
 Uh you know um it could even be done while they're doing you know a job to make money 
 But uh it's uh you know such a grassroots idea that it 
 I think the family would have to be involved in it
 And people would have to be convinced that you know 
 I think the basic message is that giving is better than receiving 
 And that's not the kind of society we have right now
 There's lots and lots of volunteer programs 
 but at least it's my opinion that most of those involve adults Adults who have the time to give and uh you know the desire to give
 uh you know it's not uh 
 maybe it cou- uh 
 younger people feel like it's not open to them 
 I don't know 
 But it should be if it's not
 Yeah
 it is kind of an introspective time of life
 But some high schools have actually started like a visitation program to uh you know uh say less advantaged areas 
 And uh they promote service on the part of the kids to uh some of those people 
 So at least that's a step in the right direction I guess
 it's really unfortunate because when you do 
 I do volunteer work for the American Lung Association
 And I have uh gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society 
 And there's no question that you know doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it uh than the people involved
 Uh it's really a gift to yourself 
 and I think that's a really important lesson to learn
 and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are uh not really happy you know
 Because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself you're just kind of down the tube you know 
 Uh it really is better to give then to receive
