 Okay 
 well I don- 
 I mean what thoughts do you have on the subject
 Oh you did
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 That's wonderful
 Well you probably have a different sense than I have 
 I went to an inner city high school in Chicago
 Um and that's not where I am originally from 
 It was a divorce situation of my parents
 And it was a cultural shock to me Uh in terms of what I went through 
 The high school in fact it was called Tulley High School 
 and now it's called Roberto Clemente 
 yeah that's exactly about twenty years now
 Uh what was it like living there 
 I mean did you find that people appreciated having the privilege of being 
 Right 
 I agree with that 
 yeah
 I didn't mean that in a totally negative sense
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 that you had ever been 
 Right 
 I mean I'll give you and idea that I had um 
 and I would say the majority appreciated what they were having in this country
 Uh but a lot of the ones that didn't even in the minority not in the sense of the cultural word they made it worse for the other kids in school 
 And you know Chicago back then even had bilingual classes
 Yeah 
 and I mean I had geometry 
 the teacher was from Cypress Greece 
 and it was Spanish and English 
 so if you can imagine how I even go- 
 I mean and I guess I look at is as an enlightening sense
 Um but basically I think they should leave things the way they are right now 
 I mean I don't really have enough in terms of an argument pro or con in terms of making any type of change
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 that's exactly 
 And that's exactly 
 I mean I can remember instances that uh wasn't as uh you know bad 
 Lord I don't know how it would be today 
 Well I know what it looks like
 I've been back up for a reunion
 It does 
 yeah 
 um but it's an experience I wouldn't change 
 I mean my husband um grew up in um a majority uh WASP southern Ohio you know
 So that um 
 when he saw where I you know saw my later teenage years he was just I hate to say aghast because that sounds so trite 
 but he was 
 And yet how did I turn out the way I did turn out
 And I said that's really irrelevant 
 What you find is that um if you can talk to like 
 I mean I learned a lot about the um Island of Puerto Rico from talking to these kids
 You know and you lived there 
 so you know that parts of it are beautiful and parts of it are squalor
 Like here yeah it's the same
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 This is true
 Uh-huh 
 I know what you're saying 
 yeah 
 th- 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 right 
 I probably would say the something if I knew intellectually that it was good 
 and emotionally that the people there wanted it
 You know it's just um 
 I mean right now they have the privilege of voting with the United States don't they
 They count yeah as a principle 
 that's what I thought 
 Um but I've also been down there 
 We traveled a lot to the B V I the British Virgin Islands
 So you always pass through San Juan in going to places like or 
 I um 
 and it's I think what they do need is an infusion of some of the United States um privileges some of our resources The educational the teachers the um academic opportunity you know 
 I don't think we do enough of a resource transfer if there is such a thing
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh 
 Uh-huh 
 They'll lose their ethnicity as they say 
 yeah 
 That's 
 Uh-huh 
 See 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 It sounds like you probably know qui- 
 I mean to this day are you still in touch with any native Puerto Ricans that you have made friends with 
 or 
 No 
 that's natural 
 I just thought I'd ask that because I wondered what you thought they might think
 Because I really don't have any um personal or professional or familial ties down there 
 I don't know the people that I went to high school with um I think the majority are in probably the generation yours and mine 
 and the one right after us um their parents did not want to acclimate to the United States Um in terms of retaining um 
 and my background's European heritage 
 and their background it would be you know we- I guess I would say the or Latino heritage
 Not speaking in English um having the children drive them everywhere and these were not old people 
 These were like in their early forties
 Um and that always bothered me 
 and then there were some children that I noticed as soon as all the kids were out of high school I mean they went back to Puerto Rico to live 
 You know they had made enough money here
 But on the other hand I guess it's all about choice in everything 
 Um was it 
 I mean how were they toward 
 that's interesting the term you used continentals which I'm sure is the proper term 
 How were they toward the United States in terms of just general relationships 
 I mean were they glad
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 I know what you're talking about 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I don't predict 
 what you're describing is actually a conflict very dif- 
 hello uh 
 you know what 
 I've got to go because that's my cordless battery going
 I'm sorry 
 I enjoyed talking to you 
 and uh thank you for your time
 Okay 
 bye-bye
