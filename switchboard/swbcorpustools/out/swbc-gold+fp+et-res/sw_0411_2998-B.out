 Well the major cause it seems up here is exc- 
 I live right on the ocean 
 so it's kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if I lived in some of the valleys inland
 but the major cause here and we always seem to and it seems to be validated by the press is the car pollution 
 We don't have too much industrial pollution
 Uh car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that I can really put my finger on here
 Is that so
 I didn't know that
 Well most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution
 Yeah
 I would think so 
 You know uh I guess it talked about all types of pollution 
 I happen to just read something the other day at least in the Boston paper there were three things that come to note 
 One is that the carbon fluorides that are uh being released into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer 
 and again 
 and now they've located or rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere 
 So car- 
 so I'm quite concerned 
 I don't think it's involved any longer with uh hair sprays or those th- 
 No 
 I think now uh from what I understand it's air conditioning units 
 and we certainly turned into an air conditioned society
 Yeah 
 I know in Florida there's no place you go that isn't air conditioned 
 and I do quite a bit of business in Washington 
 And 
 Oh yeah 
 it's quite 
 is the un- 
 it's really out of the norm not to find something that isn't air conditioned 
 And 
 and I guess refrigerators are the same way 
 They release that
 Yeah
 Well
 Yeah
 Well I th- 
 Yeah
 No 
 I think that it can be done simply because uh uh we've 
 every car now in America that's been produced for the past fifteen years has what they call a catalytic converter
 And no lead gas came to the pumps 
 and that's been done 
 There's the lead pollution that problem essentially I guess because it was at crisis proportions was licked 
 And I think that there are solutions
 certainly we don't even need a research anymore 
 It's just a matter of passing the law 
 and passing the law depends on how heavy the automobile lobby is
 That's right 
 That's right
 Oh yeah well
 the smell is awful 
 but you know I was reading the other day not to go on with this but that diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes
 So I guess you're better off sitting behind a bus than a car although I could never uh really rationalize that while I was sitting there 
 Yeah
 Well we you know 
 up here in New England uh where I've 
 right close to where I live is the Seabrook Nucleus site which is practically a you know guerilla war up here went on for years 
 Uh my daughters marched uh uh against the Seabrook 
 and I kind of uh 
 my feelings were that we needed this bridge uh to jump from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be 
 Yeah
 unfortunately though I think the oil companies have lied to us for years 
 So we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left 
 or there isn't 
 uh and uh 
 No
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yes
 That's right
 Yeah
 Well since Texas and Louisiana and uh California in that ranking order the worst pollutants in America 
 I mean I read that the other day 
 I mean Louisiana for a small state it was amazing 
 but it's the industrial pollution I should imagine
 And California seems to be taking steps 
 I mean you read about the fairly stiff laws they put in on cars now they're enforcing
 But uh again uh that didn't occur without a crisis 
 Nothing will occur I guess without a crisis
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 Exactly
 Well the greatest thing that happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as I'm concerned is the no smoking rules on airplanes and in restaurants 
 And it really is a pleasure for me although I guess smokers don't think that 
 But that to me was pollution 
 that was its most personal uh pollution that I can think of
 Surely
 something happen 
 Right on 
 thank you
 Bye-bye
