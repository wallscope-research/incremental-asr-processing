 Okay 
 You want to get a start
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh great 
 great
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I think you are earlier than we are as a rule aren't you 
 your growing Summer starts a lot earlier than ours
 Uh-huh 
 See that is quite a bit 
 we are just beginning 
 People have got their gardens in a lot of them now 
 We could still have a frost
 Uh-huh
 Uh probably not 
 But we have had a frost as late as in June
 Early June
 but we have also had nice weather An unusually uh nice Spring 
 It is almost like an early Summer for us
 Uh-huh 
 We could use a little more rain I believe
 Uh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 If it could just be spread out a little bit
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 It has really been nice here uh 
 we are supposed to have some rain this weekend 
 but I don't know if we'll get it or not 
 A lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us 
 the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us Just by well not too many miles
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 We have 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 We have quite a few farmers 
 we live out in the country 
 We are on a farm 
 but we are not a farming person 
 Uh we have a garden
 uh but we are not farmers
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 They get burnt off
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Well and that makes it bad too with water being at a premium 
 I know our aunt in California 
 they have really been rationed on their water 
 And it makes it real hard to have a yard uh or anything like that their garden their farms 
 Their farmers I guess are hurting because of that also
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well they are not allowed to water 
 so what do you do
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 But your humidity is different though than ours I think 
 and it makes a bit of a difference too
 Oh I don't know 
 I think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas 
 I could be wrong
 I do not know for sure either 
 But well it just felt different like when we were in Texas 
 It had a different feel to it
 Uh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well it could be 
 I know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times uh
 Well there is a lake not far 
 but it is more run off from surrounding you know areas and that
 And uh he is just in an area where it is just low enough that it collects there
 And uh he has had a couple of inches in his house several times
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Because of that
 Uh-huh
 where we are we get flooded it floods below us behind us 
 But uh we are high enough that we never you know have had any problem like that
 Yeah 
 It is an old farm house 
 and uh we really like it here
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 It is nice down there 
 I liked it when we visited there
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 That is the best time to go 
 Yeah 
 and usually when we have gone it has been nice 
 It has been hot 
 but it is hot to me in the wintertime down there
 You know 
 But it is nice 
 it is really a nice area
 Oh really
 Oh
 Oh good heavens 
 Not me 
 I avoid the sun 
 Yeah 
 it takes me about four and a half hours to mow our grass 
 And I try to cover up when I do the lawn 
 Yeah 
 well I have had a couple of problems 
 and uh I decided it is not worth it
 I like to get tan in the Summer time because I think you look healthier 
 And uh we are just crazy 
 Uh-huh
 Is that right
 it just makes your skin more leathery 
 uh it 
 yeah 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Well the elasticity of your skin the collagen or whatever they call it 
 They say it destroys a lot of that
 And you lose a lot of that 
 So uh 
 Yeah 
 but we have really had nice 
 the weather 
 I can't complain 
 We have really had really good weather of late
 And when it has rained it's been a good soaking rain 
 and uh it has just been a really nice Spring
 Oh
 Oh that is great
 How long will they be there
 Uh-huh 
 Well that is great 
 Well I hope the weather stays real good for them and uh that you have a good visit and everything
 And I hope your garden does good
 And so Okay 
 Well it was really nice talking to you
 And uh good luck in this venture 
 It is uh like I said 
 it has been real interesting 
 So I hope you enjoy it as much as I have been enjoying it 
 Yeah
 I forget to 
 The day goes by 
 and I forget to make a call usually
 Great 
 great
 Okay
 Uh Bye-bye
