 Well how did you like that topic
 Do you 
 I don't
 No 
 I'm pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know 
 I agree with it 
 I think uh I think a company should be able to test at any any employee any time they see fit
 I just I just don't think there's a place in our environment you know in the work force for drugs or alcohol either
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 You did
 Uh-huh Well I can sort of understand that uh 
 but not being a teacher as you are you know I I was not quite as sympathetic as you know as I probably would have been if if Kay were a teacher or something
 But uh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 That's right
 Uh that's right
 and I think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read you know 
 but uh 
 Yeah 
 I think so too 
 I I agree with it 
 Uh I know Kay's company you know 
 they started it couple of years ago 
 and so many of the people even the professional people were boy they were so against them doing that you know 
 and I thought Jeez to me it's quite simple 
 uh you either need a job or you don't 
 The the job is what provides all of your needs 
 and uh if they say Hey you can't do this work I'd say Hey I agree I don't I won't do that 
 And I think most of them have agreed to that now although they didn't like it at first
 Yeah 
 it is 
 I can see where you would think 
 Yeah 
 that is belittling you know I'd probably feel the same way if I had to do that
 *[[ Parsing error Shouldn't this be 2 slash units with the 2nd starting at "I'd probably " ]] Yeah 
 that's true
 You bet 
 Oh gosh they they would really raise a stink if that was to happen
 Right 
 yes 
 I agree with that 
 I I I wouldn't be opposed to it at all 
 it's just our bleeding heart liberals that would fight it to- tooth and nail you know
 but uh well Lynn I've enjoyed talking with you 
 I don't know how long we're supposed to carry on a conversation do you
 Oh well we'd better keep talking because I've not heard it have we
 Have you heard it
 Anyway we both sort of agree on it don't we about random testing
 Well listen
 Yeah 
 yeah
 If you agree that uh 
 Yeah
 Is that right
 You just don't think of that happening with teachers
 I really don't 
 when I think of drug testing I'm thinking of the you know outside of education
 Sure sure 
 I know that 
 but uh you don't think of that first hand normally
 Isn't that isn't that mind boggling 
 goodness 
 it it is it's mind bog- you know well you know 
 I agree with you 
 I know teachers are just like everybody else same problems the same uh good qualities as anybody else
 Yeah 
 yeah
 You you think the benefit would be greater than the 
 Uh-huh
 And that was in your children's high school
 Isn't that amazing
 If it if it's if it was true there I'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school there is 
 you know because they represent a pretty good 
 No 
 certainly not 
 certainly not 
 they don't need that example 
 but
