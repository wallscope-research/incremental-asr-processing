 Oh well that will be nice though
 But still sort of up in that general area of the country 
 so you can probably see them sometimes 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Okay
 Well uh what kind of recycling do you have in your area
 Uh-huh
 Oh what 
 which one is that
 Oh uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Oh
 Yeah 
 Sure
 On just particular things 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Well it sounds like they're doing quite a bit
 Uh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Well our company does some things all of which I couldn't even tell you about 
 I don't know all of them 
 but 
 Uh Texas Instruments
 Yeah 
 Well I I was just curious as how you got hooked up with this this speech type of thing
 Oh 
 and he 
 Yeah 
 Well here at work um each one of us has two trash baskets in our office 
 and one of those is designed for any kind of paper products that um they want to use you know for recycling 
 They can't deal with every type
 Well I guess I don't know specifically except that uh for the paper that they want to recycle they do not want any newspaper um and things like candy wrappers or uh that type of thing 
 Let's see 
 I have a list here 
 Um they don't want lunch sacks or brown envelopes uh phone books 
 So there are you know a lot of kinds of things that they don't want but then any kind of computer paper letters uh booklets 
 they'll even take things that are bound
 Um and it doesn't all have to be like white 
 They'll take colored folders
 and and uh even some of those can have plastic tabs on them
 So it's it's hard to kind of figure out you know which things are the right ones
 I mean I I'll frequently have to look at the list if it's something that I don't throw away all the time
 But um they do that 
 and then we use uh different chemicals and things 
 and I know that about how they take care of that sort of thing 
 I I don't know all the details
 but they're really on top of that
 And there probably some other things that I don't about because we're a real large company
 And I just don't have contact with them
 But in our uh city 
 well I live in a suburb of Dallas
 and they have initiated a newspaper recycling whereby they pick it up from your alley uh one day a week and all you have to do is bundle it
 Uh all around Dallas there are a lot of recycling centers where you can take things sometimes for money um but most of those are real far away from like where I live at any rate
 Very inconvenient 
 and um it's just you know hasn't been very practical to get into a lot of those things 
 If they would make it something where they you know would pick it up at the curb or at least make it you know down the street and at the corner type of thing uh 
 Yeah
 that wouldn't be so bad
 Um our grocery store like yours will take the uh plastic bags 
 and they'll also take the the paper bags back
 But um uh you mentioned the uh glass type of stuff 
 The reason I ask you about that is years ago and it it changed names somewhere along the line but um my dad used to work for Knox Glass in Knox Pennsylvania 
 Oh really 
 Yeah 
 it's 
 Yeah 
 they were taken over by Glass Containers years ago
 and but he worked for them for like thirty-one years
 And he used to travel up there to Knox quite a bit
 and and I even did once when I was a child
 you know so 
 Oh really
 Yeah 
 we 
 I was looking through our photo album not long ago 
 and they had had some pictures and things in there of Knox
 But uh I guess that's about it you know as far as what goes on that I know about
 Um
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's 
 Uh-huh 
 Well I think probably more people you know would participate if they just made it a little easier
 and like you say make it um better for companies to do these things and get involved in it without huge cost to them
 because obviously no one wants to spend a lot of money just to deal with trash you know
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 That's right 
 Uh-huh
 That's true 
 Uh-huh 
 Also probably look at packaging and that sort of thing
 We don't we don't need three quarters of what we get
 I uh 
 that's their marketing
 Well
 Yeah 
 I I'm 
 guess our city you know in picking them up must take them somewhere else and get something for them
 But I don't that it's a big money
