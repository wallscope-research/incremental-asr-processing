 Okay 
 so I think I think what we should talk about is uh the war
 The war that just went on 
 See I I don't agree with it 
 First of all I don't believe in war
 And then the United States has this attitude by saying you know thank you for keeping us our freedom and stuff like that 
 And I think it's all independent because it's it has nothing to do with the United States 
 You didn't gain anything from it
 And it wasn't our freedom that you were saving 
 It was just <> 
 the thing the thing that that that I saw was okay 
 Iraq wants to raise oil prices
 Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system by leaving them independent
 And so when Iraq you know saw this they said let's take over the country which is a good idea 
 right
 Then the United States says okay our our oil prices are going to go up 
 And like for example see okay like Lith- Lithuania right they declared themselves an independent country with a president 
 right
 Russia goes in there well the main government in Moscow goes in there 
 and they kick everybody's ass 
 And the United States doesn't go in there 
 and say listen they were you know named an independent you know state with a president and everything 
 but we're not going to go into your country
 But these countries here which you know are you know like in NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR 
 have you ever read that book
 Okay 
 NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR there are like three big continents 
 and uh there's just this area like around Egypt and stuff that everybody's fighting over 
 Now the problem is is that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries
 Right 
 like their immediate boundaries Like you're not going to go you know it's like the Army's not going to go straight into Russia because there you're you're invading their border 
 right
 But all the other countries you can fight about
 And so the thing is is that you're wasting so much money to send you know 
 it's like how much money did the U S spend when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being 
 And you know it's it was basically all based on oil because nobody 
 actually like for example if uh let's say if you know Brazil took over you know Surinam I don't think anybody would care
 You know and uh that's something that that has been you know very 
 because see the thing is is like every time that I see a war I see myself on the front line and on the other side I see myself again and I've got to shoot myself you know
 I got to shoot somebody that's got the same family that I do You know the same relationships that I do
 And just because I was born here I've got to shoot them down
 And uh but at least it was it was over quick 
 and there weren't that many deaths
 Now the only problem is is the aftermath that you're having so many deaths in the border with uh Turkey
 Well the- there's something that that the U S did right which is say say you know okay 
 let's kick him out of Kuwait which was our basic goal
 And uh now indirectly let's try to overthrow him you know
 And they're not going to do that directly 
 But the thing is is that they they didn't go into into Iraq and say you know because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country
 You know you can seek seek asylum here
 and you can go there 
 but no way are you going to rule ever again
 Well the thing is is that first of all they got to they go- they have to get him
 And and there's no way that you can get them unless it's by force
 You know And then you can put him on trial
 No 
 no 
 I think I think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in because there's I mean there's like it's like there's no hope you know like what Hitler did you know 
 You know like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life but where
 You know and so um the thing is is that once you've done something wrong which is natio- you know internationally recognized then you're going to try to get out of it 
 and the there's no way you know And especially since he's got inside Iraq for using you know chemical weapons and stuff
 And you know like he sent planes over to to shoot the people down that were on the border with uh tha- that were on their way to Turkey
 He had a couple of them bombarded
 Huh-uh 
 But uh you know he's got uh millions of dollars 
 like th- I think it was like I don't know if it was fifty billion or fifty million which is really doesn't make any difference 
 Yeah
 But it's just it's just that uh you know i- you know like the 
 we just put our goals in different you know levels is 
 like saying you know it's like 
 yeah 
 sure 
 we need oil you know
 and we need it desperately
 But the other countries that you know that have oil but not as big you know like they say you know like when the prices went up and then they went down
 When they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia or something
 Well th- it its an advantage
 You know it's like you're saying okay I can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon and I'm not going to bring them back down to you know ninety-nine cents
 Why 
 because people are willing to pay a dollar fifty a gallon 
 so if I di- leave it at a dollar ten people are still going to pay
 You know I went down forty cents
 but I went up ten cents
 Yeah
 Ninety-eight
 Oh God 
 Here it's like it's like a dollar five
 Yeah
 But still the 
 I mean have you ever checked like uh the most money-makers in uh in nineteen uh ninety 
 Uh you can see that uh Exxon and Amaco and uh other companies oh God I forgot their names but uh Exxon was the number one money-maker
 and that was just because of of the last quarter
 Yeah
 And uh that was 
 I mean and what other companies are went up four hundred and some percent
 And that's practically impossible to do now a days for a company to to shoot up in that way
 And uh it's just that you know people people take advantage of that 
 You know like the the companies are saying we're trying not to raise our prices but when you know when we get a barrel coming in at more than what we're selling it for we've got to raise our prices
 You know but still if you realize that uh one barrel has {D like how much was it like } um forty gallons
 it's got forty gallons 
 and they're selling you know you know 
 you got to pay forty dollars at least and you know for uh for one gallon 
 and it's it was selling like at twenty-five or something
 So you're making uh you know fifteen dollars profit easily
 And uh everything 
 I mean and and the expenses you know of the war you know it's like uh it's like who's gaining on this
 Okay 
 because uh i- does does the U S government own any gas companies like like you know gas stations and stuff
 I because see like for example I don't know if the British government owns Shell 
 I'm not sure about that
 But the thing is like the U S government got nothing out of it Because well you know it's like oth- the other independent companies the gas stations you know they did 
 And uh then the taxes go up 
 and then everybody else loses
 But um you know they're just they're just some things that might not be worth it
 You know and and first of all how many how many people had to had to die before the war you know 
 it's like transporting stuff and things like that before you know it's like 
 yeah 
 sure you know like to to a couple people that died there their families don't feel it was necessary to do that
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 you you could you could never bring them back
 Oh well 
 Yeah 
 so okay 
 nice talking to you
 Bye-bye
