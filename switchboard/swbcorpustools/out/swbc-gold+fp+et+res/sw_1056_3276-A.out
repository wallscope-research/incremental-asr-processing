 Okay 
 as far as uh universal health care um I guess I'm all for it 
 I think it's time that we start looking at uh getting into that 
 Um health cost has continued to rise 
 and I think uh there's people that to me it's the fundamental uh life of a person 
 Uh it doesn't matter if you have money or no mone- or all the money in the world um 
 you would 
 Everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits 
 Um I think if uh they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and uh individuals um helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how 
 But uh the expenses right now for health care um are just unreal
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Oh sure
 And your constantly 
 Exactly
 Yeah 
 The only 
 I I know that um uh I know a little bit about the uh European uh universal health care 
 and there's some pros and cons 
 One of the things of course is everybody gets health care 
 but uh sometimes health care uh when you get into a universal system lacks in uh what would be considered uh 
 how can I say it 
 Um over like in Poland uh where my father-in-law lived for years there their health care system is um 
 because no financial gains are available for doctors 
 Uh they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason 
 but most people that go in to being a physician here in the U S do it for financial gain
 They say well jeez If I get into this area of dermatology I don't have to do this 
 I can do this 
 and I can you know 
 Yeah 
 or plastic surgery 
 or uh if I become a uh heart specialist I'm going to make this kind of money uh 
 and there's you know financial gains toward that 
 And in a universal system I don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors
 The quality I think goes down Uh-huh when you have a universal system
 Um the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check um and also offering some kind of 
 because I think uh all physicians well anybody um likes the ability to kind of uh get themselves financially uh situated 
 Uh I guess that's the whole U S concept is to come here and 
 Yeah 
 and I don't know if you can have that with a universal system 
 Maybe you know there's a way of working that out 
 but I know that in Poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it 
 That's what they look at it as
 There's no uh 
 and that's sad because if that's the case if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway
 But that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind
 So 
 But I I think we have to head toward that way
 Uh-huh
 I'm worried when I get older
 You know and uh let's say for instance you uh get fired or not fired but maybe laid off from your job 
 You no longer have insurance
 I mean and you're sixty some or fifty some years old you try try to find insurance
 I mean y- you're uninsurable Unless you want to pay five hundred six hundred dollars a month 
 and I know people that are paying two hundred three hundred dollars a month for insurance
 And how they can do it I have no idea 
 Um I know working for small corporations 
 and health insurance um myself um it would cost for a family 
 and this was back three four years ago to put my entire family up 
 and this was working for like a med center uh health plan 
 Um it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck
 So 
 See 
 Yeah
 Well we do the same 
 I mean it's 
 I think uh people are changing their viewpoints of you know 
 it's getting harder and harder to survive
 And uh and that's why uh if they don't go to a universal system something is going to happen
 We're going to have uh a larger amount of people dying
