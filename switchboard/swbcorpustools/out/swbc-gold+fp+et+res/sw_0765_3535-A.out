 Okay 
 where does she live
 Rutherford 
 I don't know that
 Uh-huh
 It's oh oh south and okay 
 yeah 
 I know where you I know the area 
 Right 
 that's kind of on the other side of town 
 so our kids probably never went to school together or anything 
 Oh well I've got one in college 
 By now
 Right 
 Whether it is possible to have an honest government I'm beginning to think it's not 
 What about you 
 I don't either 
 I I think 
 uh even if people have good intentions I think uh power corrupts or something to a certain extent you know 
 Yeah 
 it seems like uh maybe more of them come in with good intentions 
 but it's just so enticing 
 and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available because they're in on the know you know 
 Oh 
 Right 
 I mean you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions 
 you know what I mean
 Little bitty little bitty positions in your own home town and they'll cheat somehow or you know bend the rules use their power 
 So maybe it's just man's nature 
 Uh-huh
 Oh my word
 Oh wow 
 What were they doing taking some 
 Oh no 
 Oh gosh 
 Yeah 
 right 
 Right 
 Oh
 Um We haven't had that big a scandal in Arlington 
 but we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records 
 In other words they'd go out and have a big lavish dinner and then put somebody's name down that they supposedly had entertained 
 but that person wasn't even anywhere near there you know 
 Some of them weren't even in the same city 
 One of them had had cancer and died 
 and I mean that was our biggest scandal for the last few years I think
 I don't I don't either Uh to make it totally honest 
 Uh I think there's there's always going to be some way somebody can cut a corner uh 
 However the things that have gone gone on in the last couple of years we can't afford too many of those you know the the HUD mess or the S and L 
 We could almost not afford such terrible corruption
 Right 
 right 
 I think that uh Reagan and Bush were up to their necks in that Iran Contra thing 
 and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that 
 but uh 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 That's right 
 but they stay there 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 and this would be for the best for the nation overall 
 You're right 
 it's just a 
 I don't know 
 I guess that's where they stay in uh in 
 they try to stay in office 
 But they always please the money people too 
 They need money so much because they're constantly having to run for office again 
 And 
 Uh-huh
 That's true 
 Boy it is a big problem 
 but I think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now/
 don't you
 I know 
 It's really terrible 
 I mean there was a time I mean where I remember when I was real young I just loved Harry Truman 
 I thought he was great 
 Oh you know I had 
 some of them seemed like kind of uh heroic people
