 So how do you feel about capital punishment
 Really
 Oh I'm pretty much for it
 We'll have some interesting discussion I guess
 Wrongfully 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it would never be equal 
 Right
 Right 
 Yeah
 Well I guess you know I I guess I can see it from several different perspectives 
 but you know when I hear about things like you know what they've what they've been reporting about in Milwaukee you know I I to me I don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy 
 You know maybe there is I don't know
 But you know and you know he's never going to be to me a functioning part of society 
 He's already been either paroled or whatever for child molestation
 I mean I don't know 
 I just I really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko 
 And you know for the things he's done 
 I don't know 
 I guess it's either you know put him in jail for the rest of his life you know or or capital punishment I guess You know
 an- and- Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Right
 Yeah Well I can underst- 
 I I mean you know there there is always that chance 
 but you know I guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever I don't I mean I don't know 
 but uh you know but that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be you know 
 you you you really throw a lot on the courts hopefully that they won't do that you know for any for any situation really 
 But uh you know when I you find somebody just like that situation I mean it was disgusting when I read about it today 
 And and when you find someone like that that you know is guilty he confessed already to killing eleven I I'd you know I guess I have a hard time feeling merciful toward him 
 and you know Right
 Right
 Right
 And trying to rehabilitate him too 
 and you know 
 Right 
 exactly 
 And uh you know nobody wants that
 You know everybody would be just as scared to death you know 
 We we've had a real problem here in Texas with uh prison overcrowding 
 and they've been releasing people left and right 
 and you know they've committed murders and rapes and everything else 
 and you know you just think you know where's the justice here
 I mean you know they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving
 Oh really
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 exactly 
 Yeah 
 Well you know that's exactly I mean I'm I'm not saying I I think capital murder or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case you know especially because there are some cases when you just don't know 
 and I I think there's a a shadow of a doubt you know like with this this guy in in Milwaukee 
 I mean it 
 he pretty much confessed to it 
 I mean they you know 
 just everything I mean cannibalism and everything else uh
 I really would have a hard time especially if I was on a jury not wanting him to you know be executed Yeah 
 Because I mean that's just awful
 Right 
 Well I have a hun- I have a hunch that you know the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway Either 
 I mean you know they 
 I don't know 
 from from what I hear about jail life is not any way to live
 But uh I don't know It's just 
 Uh-huh
 Really 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 That 
 Yeah 
 Well you know especially like repeat offenders 
 It it just appalls me that they can be out you know they even get a ten year sentence and be out in in two or three or four years 
 You know that's that's scary because you know I'm not sure I think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're you know going to be committing any more violent acts or not
 Right
 And it it's it's really scary 
 I me- you know 
 I I don't know what the perfect solution to that is 
 but I know that especially with violent crimes where you know you're nearly a hundred percent convinced that they're guilty and without much repentance or anything else you know then I don't know I I guess I I just really don't see much use for this guy in Milwaukee you know 
 For instance I mean that's just 
 I could see capital punishment in a case like that And you know for for other people too that do things like that 
 But uh when 
 uh my wife and I are both participating in this survey 
 and she picked up the phone 
 and when she heard the topic she said capital punishment 
 so she was uh 
 Yeah 
 well luckily it was for me Because they want th- they coordinate the times so it can only be one or the other
 So she tried to enter her number 
 and it wouldn't work 
 so she said whew it's for you
 So but uh you know I don't know 
 I I struggle with it 
 but I I really think that in in terms of like this I'd I think that it it might not be such a bad thing Because I don't know that anybody w- in- I don't know that anybody would feel good you know like if you let someone like that loose in your community 
 You know I I I'm su- 
 you'd have to be scared to death
