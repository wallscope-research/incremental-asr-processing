 I guess you heard our conv- our topic for today was clothing
 How you dress for work and season to season and everything
 How do you dress for work
 Sure
 You bet
 Look professional 
 Yeah 
 I understand 
 I am a 
 I own my company 
 I am in the I am uh manufactures rep sales organization 
 and my office is a small office 
 and I am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that
 but then when I travel it is a little different situation
 Uh suits and sports coat tie and the whole bit Cause you go to meetings and you are required to look your best and look professional of course
 Yeah 
 I think in today's society uh there is more credibility to be quite honest
 I will always remember 
 I will tell this real quick story when I graduated from college 
 my first job years ago uh thirty years ago twenty-nine years ago in fact was selling agricultural fertilizer
 I worked for the uh Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical 
 and I sold uh you know manure
 And uh I would go out and call on farmers 
 and I would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that 
 but I was calling on guys that wore bib overalls
 And so one day I got up and thought well I will just go casual and you know that I called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls 
 and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional
 and he sort of expected me to dress as a professional
 so uh it was sort of 
 You bet even back then 
 so I sort uh been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best 
 but here again I dress casual quite a bit 
 so 
 It gives you confidence 
 In my business if I call on the the J C Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago then I wear coat and tie 
 If I call on just uh a normal little dealer of mine I might be casual
 I call on Oshman's sporting goods again it may be casual or it may be coat and tie 
 So it depends 
 Uh probably no
 Probably no Because uh today I believe you can get away with 
 but then it depends on who you are calling on 
 Who you're 
 you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie you just uh he would be missing something
 Although he shouldn't be evaluated on that
 So it's its' just different
 Yes 
 it is
 I am uh like a Catholic 
 and the people that go to my Church you know 
 Catholics dress very casual a lot of the times 
 People in jeans and in whatever 
 but yet the way I was raised 
 I am a converted Catholic 
 the way I was raised 
 I was raised a Baptist 
 and like as a youngster I use to always dress up all the time 
 I guess that has changed also
 Right
 Sure
 But 
 That is a very good point 
 I am from West Virginia 
 so I understand what you are saying there
 and it's it's a very good point
 But you shouldn't what's the old saying you shouldn't judge a book by its cover
 And uh evaluation of an individual Course all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have 
 I think you have to dress sort of accordingly
 But uh you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and uh or evaluate a person by that
 What about season to season 
 Does 
 I guess your dress changes
