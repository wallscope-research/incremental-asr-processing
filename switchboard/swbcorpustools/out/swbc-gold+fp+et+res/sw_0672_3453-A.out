 Okay 
 did they tell you our topic
 Okay 
 it's uh 
 The topic is cars 
 What kind of car will you buy next 
 and what kind of decision you'd do you think about getting you know pick that car out and uh and why
 Okay
 Yeah 
 I'm the same way 
 I was uh I had two Cadillacs 
 I went to my first Lincoln this last time 
 I travel 
 and uh my grandfather worked for Ford Motor Company 
 so he always said why don't you drive a Ford or why don't you try a Lincoln
 so I finally tried one after fifty years 
 and uh I've had I guess I guess four Cadillacs and and one Suburban in my last five cars 
 but I bought a Lincoln 
 and I like it
 Oh are you
 Uh-huh
 Well I'm a I'm a traveling salesman 
 I travel on the road 
 so I like a little heavier car 
 but 
 So that's why I choose you know to drive a heavier car and more luxury car 
 But I tell you what 
 I will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly
 Yeah 
 because I like the Lincoln 
 but there's just something about that Cadillac that whether it's a G M C product or whatever Seems they handle better
 I think so too
 Yeah 
 they really do
 You know I'm a funny duck 
 that came it comes to the simple things like front end alignments
 I have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac 
 I don't know why why whether I just seem to drive them better or what 
 but I've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac 
 They always appear to hold well
 Uh-huh
 Did you
 And the only thing I miss about a Cadillac is 
 a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car 
 and I traded it in traded it in on my Lincoln 
 and they're just not as large as before 
 I do miss that
 Well you're right
 Yeah 
 it's big 
 but the trunk space for me uh 
 what I usually do is I usually take the back seat out of my car 
 and that's where I put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough
 Yeah 
 now I have the Town Car 
 and it's it's a deep trunk but not as broad as the uh the Cadillac
 Uh-huh
 Oh good
 They went all the way down
 Well that's good
 That's good
 Yeah 
 I sell sporting goods uh hunting related items 
 I sell guns gun cases and things like that
 and I need to you know 
 that's about the same size as a golf club
 They need to samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that 
 and 
 Nope
 Right
 Yeah 
 I drove mine a couple weeks ago to our one of our big national sales meetings in Nashville 
 I usually fly 
 I drove it with another one of my guy that worked for me 
 We drove it ten hours to Nashville 
 and it it handled real well 
 but my main thing is space 
 so if a Continental 
 I might consider it the next time 
 a Continental has more trunk space
 You always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs
 Yeah 
 I like leather interiors also
 Uh-huh
 That's a nice car
 You bet 
 and I'll I will say one thing about Cadillacs versus
