 Okay
 Uh-huh
 I am too
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's good
 And how old is your baby
 Yes
 Well I walk two and a half to three miles every night
 My husband and I were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago
 and he lost sixty-two pounds
 and I lost twenty-one
 So we've decided to maintain our weight that we will do this exercise walking program 
 and we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school 
 We have a little path that we do And uh except if it's raining or real cold which it hasn't been
 we try to get out uh every every night
 And he plays racquetball twice a week 
 but I'm not into that 
 so I think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned
 Yes
 Right 
 that's right 
 I know my kids are into sports 
 and a lot of times tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty 
 so we will just go out after that
 So my kids luckily are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I go out and walk
 Yes
 Yes
 No
 my husband never was either until he lost the weight
 That was his decision 
 He had arthritis in his hips 
 and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise
 So once he got motivated now he's ready to walk every night 
 And our dog has lost a little weight 
 He walks every night too 
 So he gets excited when he sees us put on our our shoes our walking shoes 
 Yes
 Making time for it
 Yes
 I know 
 I do too
 Right
 No
 I never do either Even if I have my dog with me
 You know it's nice to have another person there 
 but 
 Mostly it's my husband 
 and sometimes it's my kids
 Uh-huh
 Me too 
 I did the dance step when I lived up in Michigan 
 and it just wore me out 
 I would leave totally exhausted 
 I never lost any weight 
 and I got to the point I dreaded going in
 So walking seems to be a good solution for me 
 and it doesn't cost anything 
 Yes
 That's the one time in the day my husband and I can get away and talk without having the kids jump in and 
 Yep
 Yep
 Yep 
 that's all I do too
 Okay
