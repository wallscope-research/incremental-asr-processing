 Yeah
 So have you ever served on a jury
 Yeah 
 I finally served on one last year 
 I've um been voting for years 
 and I couldn't figure out why I hadn't been called yet
 and I finally was 
 So it was an interesting experience 
 I was kind of boring
 *[[listen; should I be "it"]] Uh it was uh uh it was uh well let's see it was municipal court
 so it was a combination of uh 
 and I was in the pool for a couple of weeks
 so it was a combination of criminal and civil 
 and they had uh 
 well most of the time we we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors
 and then it was always exciting when we got called to to to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides uh just sit in the jury room
 Uh yeah 
 the judge did 
 Uh I uh I had a hard time getting seated on a jury 
 I kept getting uh 
 I'd be questioned uh for empaneling the jury 
 and they kept uh dismissing me
 Course they don't have to give a reason 
 but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know 
 they want to get the best uh mix for their case 
 so they ask all kinds of wild questions
 Yeah 
 well I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions 
 and I think part of it was they didn't uh they didn't like the fact that I don't drink any more 
 So 
 Yeah 
 that was probably it 
 although in my case I might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught 
 I don't know
 Well I was never there never there for any sentencing 
 Uh I finally got empaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day 
 and uh we got into the uh jury room to uh decide the case 
 and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was uh not guilty 
 and he would never vote for guilty
 So uh they appointed me jury jury foreman 
 and I uh didn't think that uh going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict 
 so I told the judge that we weren't were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate
 So the whole thing had to be tried over again
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 it was uh it was funny 
 The uh 
 I ju- I I don't know 
 I uh I didn't uh uh I didn't like not being able to deliberate
 I uh I I wanted to vote guilty for the guy 
 and the other people were kind of mixed
 so uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again 
 Cost him a lot of money 
 I'm sure
 Uh it must have been six
 Yeah
 Um
 Um
 Yeah 
 Well let's see 
 is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Uh it was too circumstantial
 Um
