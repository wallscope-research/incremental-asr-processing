 I don't know that it's so much a military threat anymore as a 
 well you know it's it's real confusing right now to know what kind of a of of a threat it is I guess
 it it takes awhile to to get used to something 
 you know if if they have completely chain- 
 on the place has completely turned that much around to where they're not you know not what they used to be
 uh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I thi- 
 yeah 
 the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so uh dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute you know we're getting stuck into something here you know 
 if if somebody's about to to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know we're we're ashamed we're not going to do that anymore
 And uh um you know I'd I'd like to think that that isn't true 
 but I I 
 you know the evidence is that uh you know he's he's let some some stuff go you know the east German situation
 It's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible 
 you know if I'd have been asleep for five years and read it in a book I said no no no that didn't couldn't have happened that way
 Uh-huh
 <> Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I I think you know what I'd have to 
 I I gues- I guess to answer the question directly I'm still just a a little bit you know leery of the whole thing
 What I haven't seen is the uh you know a great stepping back in the military situation 
 You know it's it's one thing you know to let us go ahead and sort of disarm 
 and you know I even had a thought once that the whole Iraqi thing might have been just a a deal to go ahead and let us uh you know expend some some military hardware 
 Of course it didn't turn out that way
 And uh uh that that may have been a a a kind of far out way of thinking about it I don't know
 Uh-huh
 <> Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 or or we can do something about it 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well the the China situation you know the when it looked like that thing was was turning around 
 and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the in the Red Square or wherever said okay 
 and that's enough
 And the tanks came in and you know pretty much took care of that 
 And 
 <> Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward you know just some pretty hard by the socialism
 and uh you know the the reaction uh 
 you know the the economic 
 well the uh the social structure of the Soviet Union you know it it's it's coming apart at the seams
 You know and I've heard people say well you know it's just like the American Civil War will there be a union or not 
 Well no 
 it's not the same sort of a thing at all because that the whole Soviet system was put together under total force 
 you know there was no 
 as as we are seeing now with a lot of those areas wanting out of it
 you know they uh nobody vo- 
 you know a lot 
 man those people didn't vote to become part of the Soviet Union 
 they had no choice
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 There there was the whole thing was put together you know by force 
 There's there's no no real question about that
 And some of the countries that were forced in at th- later dates is the three Baltic countries you know came in in the forties
 and uh it's well it's not that they came in it's they were conquered by the Germans
 and then the Russians even took it back from the Germans and never bothered to give it back you know 
 so That's a a little different situation
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers
 I knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany they said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts all the bombs are going to go right over Germany 
 and they're going to land in other places
 you know that's going to be the safest place to be
 Yeah 
 well uh I I guess what they'd have to do to 
 I really don't know 
 you know in in the in you know I hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears
 You know some reason or other you know is uh it's kind of a strange thing we've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say whoa wait a minute 
 you know What's uh what's what's really happening here
 But you wonder how well this thing 
 w- who was it Boris Yeltsin the guy that's running the uh or evidently was elected president of the Soviet for the Russian republic which is I guess the uh the biggest
 Uh-huh
 Well in the center 
 but you got a the the great big area that's just was traditionally known as Russia 
 and then all these little nationality groups around it you know that were you know was there nineteen of them or or whatever 
 you know and these were all the Soviet economists us you know they had some real fancy names for them
 Matter of fact when the 
 uh yeah 
 what I read when the uh lee- uh United Nations was setup in in San Francisco one of the first things the Russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the uh of these you know republics as a separate country 
 you know so there would be there would be nineteen rather than one
 And uh the United States said well that mean we get to bring in forty-eight you know
 And uh that sort of 
 you know they backed down on that
 Yeah 
 well wonder if that 
 wh- uh w- what do you get shot by something that's called a an economic force or what is called a military pact 
 you know it's all 
 you can change the name of something 
 but I wonder if it's still exists
 Although I've seen some evidence that you know the uh the Russian soldiers are 
 well you 
 the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because there's they're having housing shortages now 
 What do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by uh Bulgaria and and Czechoslovakia 
 and now all of a sudden they're going home 
 and somebody's got to pay for their 
 Yeah 
 Well that's not 
 Yeah
