 Yes 
 I have 
 In fact uh just a little over just a little less than a year ago uh my mother went to be with the Lord 
 and we cared for her the last oh seventeen months of her life here in the at home Aside from uh having to uh take her to the hospital 
 and uh you know those times well she was there in the the regular hospital
 And then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer 
 and so the doctor elected to have her uh finish out uh in the hospice program
 And uh I as far as I'm concerned that is far and above any nursing home because uh she's around her own fa- you know the the elderly parent in question is around their own family 
 The uh hospice program provides a hospital type bed Well it is a hospital bed and all the oxygen stuff and a uh and a visiting nurse at least every other day et cetera et cetera et cetera
 And it's all taken care of by by uh Medicare uh 
 and uh it it's it's really neat {F uh 
 } And I you know I wouldn't I wouldn't banish uh my old loved one to a to a warehouse
 And that's that's what I basically uh view a nursing home as a warehouse 
 so that's 
 Pardon me
 Uh-huh 
 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Yeah 
 I know 
 But uh in this case uh spouse and I uh are uh we're are are uh united in this area because I guess her father her grandfather and grandmother both lived with uh her parents uh th- th- their golden years too 
 so this isn't like uh uh just one one uh instance 
 In fact uh her uh uh experiences were were invaluable to me 
 Uh in fact I don't know if I could have uh held up uh you know without my wife uh helping in this this in this case
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh okay
 Uh-huh
 Well maybe well as as you say the care of of grandmother or was was just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it
 Oh boy 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well then then there's almost then there's almost no no uh uh choice left to her then 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 In fact just uh just uh sit and chat with them for five minutes and and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 And then then 
 Oh yeah 
 it did 
 and I was just pr- I just praised the Lord that that we were able to uh have uh uh
