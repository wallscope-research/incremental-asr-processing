 Okay
 Um we have small children two and four
 and so we our dining is very limited 
 Oh we're past that now 
 We're a little sick of that 
 No 
 um we're more 
 like um you know like Wyatt's Cafeteria
 Yeah 
 that way 
 And the kids just love everything that's there 
 so we're pretty fortunate 
 Kind of um buffet style uh 
 so you can go in and go out 
 and the food's already served 
 and you don't have to wait 
 and it's already in front of them when you sit down 
 and things like um Souper Salads you know 
 it's again it's buffet 
 and it's already prepared 
 and just things any any eating area that you just don't have to wait an extreme amount of time
 We 
 No 
 We tried a Bennigan's one time 
 and it was terrible 
 Course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyway 
 We we waited almost forty-five minutes before everything was brought out 
 and it was we were ready to go home
 Yeah
 No 
 We fought with them for forty-five minutes
 So we we we rarely go eat in those kind of eating uh situations any more 
 But we do love to eat out 
 and um and we do it as often as we can 
 and and times that we do have baby-sitters we we try and catch um some things that we normally wouldn't do you know
 Oh um let me see uh for New Year's we went to eat at Uncle Julio's
 It's um on on Walnut and Greenville
 It's called Uncle Julio's
 Um basically Mexican food
 And it's supposed to be very similar to um uh

 It's basically the same thing seafood Cajun style
 That's in Addison off of Belt Line
