 Well uh no 
 I don- I don't get as much exercise as I as I should as or as I would like to uh uh these days 
 I 
 seems to be to easy to get busy with other things 
 Uh I have in the past uh jogged and and run 
 and every every January and every September I start out again 
 and then it tapers off 
 Uh what about you
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Well now that is that uh that's related to the the aerobic uh 
 Okay
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well uh okay 
 Now that's inside again 
 right
 But 
 Do do you like to do it wi- with other people 
 I mean like the the jazzercise would be 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 But 
 Yeah 
 right 
 Right 
 But still there are there are other people there doing the doing the same thing 
 In terms of motivation and incentive 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 uh that makes a difference doesn't it
 I I've 
 one thing 
 when when I have run and jogged uh 
 I've always enjoyed doing it by myself 
 and and kno- 
 not with the sense that it was uh uh chore or something that I was having to do 
 I I've really enjoyed just the activity 
 and uh I write software uh as far as the job 
 and so getting out and being active uh is uh uh helps out 
 The th- 
 it's 
 The ch- the chan- the change of pace and just getting out and around 
 and I find that I can often you know 
 often uh when I get around to doing it then I I feel better when I get back to work 
 and uh uh also that that it my subconscious is working on things while I'm working 
 and I I go back 
 and I've got new ideas 
 but still 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that's uh I think that's a good term d- demanding the time for yourself 
 That you've just got to you've just got to prior- 
 Right 
 Yeah
 Well good 
 well good 
 Well uh uh have you have you done any jogging 
 I tell you you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in in the uh club
