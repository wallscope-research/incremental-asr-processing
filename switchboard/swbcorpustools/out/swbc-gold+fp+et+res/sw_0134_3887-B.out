 Well I guess we're uh forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution 
 I hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars 
 and low polluting fuels are being experimented with Ethanol and other types of fuels
 I you know I assume that the major sources are cars and factories
 But I I don't know for sure 
 I just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from would 
 comes over the border from us
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes
 Um I guess there's been a lot of pressure to um do away with the C F C's in these spray bottles which has been a real problem
 Again I that's what I hear 
 and and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there's a hole in the ozone or not 
 but at last I heard it was uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially 
 Well it is scary 
 and I think it will uh continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively 
 We've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment
 I I I'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't do that 
 In Los Angeles they're apparently going to 
 they've passed laws that for habit for example people using uh barbecues *[[listen for habit> prohibit]] gasoline lawn mowers um 
 and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles 
 and it's gotten bad in Denver 
 and and uh it's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky 
 And people in this country are really wedded to their uh cars
 and our economy seems to 
 and this I think is one of the big problems
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well that makes a lot of sense 
 I mean I I hadn't thought about it that way 
 but it it 
 Yeah
 No 
 and I think 
 Yeah 
 and I think that that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it is a is an organism of sorts and that there is a a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it 
 and uh we're going to feel it 
 and I think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars
 and in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable 
 For example taxing people heavily for using their cars 
 And uh I have a little sports car that I enjoy using 
 and I know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive 
 but I think uh we're going to have to make some fundamental changes 
 and and I'm I'm not sure how long it's going to take or what it's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and houses we sell
