 Well I don't 
 I have children 
 I have little children 
 Both of my kids are under two so right now we don't have pets 
 but we've had lots of them in the past
 Uh-huh
 Well we had a dog before we moved here 
 Uh and we couldn't bring her with us 
 We came from Colorado 
 and we've had hamsters and fish and birds
 Okay 
 I've 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh 
 Yes
 Definitely 
 Well we you know 
 if it um if it were just more peaceful you know with the little ones we would definitely have a pet 
 I just think it's nice to have around 
 We had a cat that had kittens 
 So any pet that I get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered
 Because uh I did 
 That experience was awful 
 Uh-huh
 <> what you doing 
 Oh
 Well a lot of times now when you buy them from like the S P C A or from the humane societies or whatever their adoption includes their spaying
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 <> uh-huh
 Yeah
 My husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us
 Our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room 
 but our cat would sleep with us 
 and he hated that
 Uh-huh 
 He just thought that they belong 
 and when she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that
 So I guess it's probably probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat even though I love cats 
 I think it would probably be a dog 
 and it would definitely be an outdoor animal
 Uh-huh 
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh that would Greg uh 
 my husband's grandparents have a dog 
 and they just 
 it needs to be put to sleep 
 but it's grandpa's dog 
 and uh he's really getting too old to take care of it 
 But the dog messes all over the carpet 
 and my daughter is just nine months old
 and so then she crawls on the carpet 
 and oh the smell I mean it's just really awful 
 and that's that's one real drawback 
 but you know I guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough 
 Uh-huh
