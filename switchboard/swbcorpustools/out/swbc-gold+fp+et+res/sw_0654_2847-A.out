 Tell me what books you read
 Um 
 I try to avoid the 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That does cut into your reading time a lot
 Yeah
 Well my my kids are up and out of the house now 
 So you know I will uh encourage you that you do get t- a little more time to yourself later on 
 I won't say what
 Yeah
 Oh uh well I read for a living 
 Uh I'm an editor 
 And s- so I I'm at the 
 Center for Advanced Study of the Behavioral Sciences and therefore I read uh psychology sociology anthropology political science philosophy linguistics history uh
 yeah 
 and you name it 
 I've read some of it
 It really is 
 It's it's a great place to be 
 and the uh 
 it's nice to work with people uh who are not required to use your services and so therefore are grateful and not arguing y- with you about them 
 If they don't want an editor they don't come 
 Um
 No 
 We don't 
 Uh normally we don't publish uh things under our own imprint 
 Uh we have books that are written here that are then published by all sorts of different uh commercial and academic publishers and university presses
 So uh I end up sometimes reading the things that are written here all the way through sometimes just a few chapters because that's as far as they get 
 But I also get of course lots of references to neat stuff to read about
 So I'm uh I was just thinking when they told me the topic I should just I should read the uh titles of the five books that are sitting on my desk right now that I'm in the middle of
 And uh I'm reading uh WITHIN THE PLANTATION HOUSEHOLD which is a history uh sort of a sociological history of southern women black and white living on plantations *[[needs slash unit]] Uh a book called POISONS OF THE PAST which is about ergotisms that uh fungus that grows on rye
 it causes the uh uh Saint Anthony's Fire Disease where people fell into fits 
 and There is a a theory at least that a lot of people who were accused of witchcraft were actually under the influence of erga
 And a book called JOB CUES GENDER CUES which explains uh how certain professions and vocations get uh flip flopped from one gender predominance to the other 
 like uh nursing started out all men and then in the nineteenth century began to have women 
 And now it's practically all women
 And that uh 
 That's right 
 And the thing that changed that was the manual typewriter 
 It then it became you see just sort of a clerical task
 When you wrote it out in long hand you were a 
 Yes 
 You were a confidential assistant to the person
 Right 
 And then I've got a book called FASHIONS IN SCIENCE which is a sociology that explains uh why certain theories get to be popular in uh sociology And uh how difficult it is to swim against the tide if you have a different idea that isn't vatted by your peers 
 And then I have one novel that's called FIRST LIGHT 
 that's about uh archaeology the British novel 
 So it's really quite interesting 
 I haven't got too far into it yet
 Uh those are all books that are out uh published and bound now 
 But they're just things that pertain to various things I'm working on or were uh mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity 
 So I got them out of the library and decided I'd read some more in them
 So I read a lot of history and uh a few novels occasional mystery stories just for fun
 Uh-huh 
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 Oh hey 
 That's a nifty idea
 Great
 Oh I think the the boom to parents and the the shoelace department was those little Velcro tabs 
 I think that's incredibly 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 What do you think is the most promising or practical book uh of that kind you've read recently
 Um 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I knew his literary agent in Houston when she was just uh convincing him to write all this down 
 He was teaching 
 Yeah 
 I s- I saw one of those episodes on P B S 
 Uh from time to time out here we have four different P B S channels that we can get on the cable 
 And they'll have all ten of those shown back to back in the middle of the night for people can video tape them
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Huh
 Uh-huh 
 Oh yes 
 Oh 
 Oh there's some absolutely wonderful illustrated children's books 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 e- right 
 Uh well 
 Yeah 
 I read THE PUBLISHER'S WEEKLY uh which lists all the upcoming books forthcoming books 
 and uh there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful 
 But I was tickled to see that some publisher is uh reprinting the the James Thurber books for children THE WONDERFUL O and THE THIRTEEN CLOCKS that have been out of print for about oh I think about twenty years
 Well I had those for my kids 
 and they really did enjoy them 
 Oh but they were old copies then 
 I didn't buy them when my kids were little 
 And so they probably were out of print all of already when my kids were small 
 But um I was really happy to see that 
 yeah 
 I guess it's in honor of his hundredth
