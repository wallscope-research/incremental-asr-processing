 Why don't you start
 Things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that
 Are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing
 Yeah 
 I've done both 
 Uh uh my wife has picked up a couple of things saying uh boy if we could refinish that that would be a beautiful piece of furniture 
 and uh we've done it a couple of times 
 I guess that we've been fairly successful with those 
 That's uh that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it I guess
 Uh I have a a uh really nice desk A nicer desk than I could afford Which I got because my sister who worked in a hospital uh liberated it after a fire 
 and uh we stripped it all the way down and refinished it 
 and it turned out to be really nice uh a nice desk Maple top I think or or something of that sort
 Oh really
 Oh I'm jealous 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I do do things uh that might be too crude to be called woodworking 
 I've built my own deck and uh things like that
 And uh I definitely have begun to accumulate tools too 
 My I uh I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive 
 and so I do have a band saw and a router and uh things like that out in the garage 
 But I can't say I use them very often 
 They're handy uh they they come in handy at the most unusual times 
 Putting doors in is the time when I'm 
 uh I bought myself a uh template for making mortices and doors 
 and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel 
 But I've also I've also used them for building drawers where you uh for rabbeting and uh because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain 
 So I got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months I had it 
 and now I use it twice a year maybe 
 The big 
 Uh I guess it 
 The ones that what
 Uh I have never even s- I have never even looked at one closely 
 Uh the the little use that I've gotten from my router I would say uh I would spend my money on the bits 
 Uh I have a I'd guess you'd call a medium quality Craftsman router 
 and the uh 
 It's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three-eighths of an inch at a time 
 But the problem is that the uh as with 
 any any time you buy a a tool with a a as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end
 So the price of a good set of uh carbide steel uh bits is probably uh I mean a a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars 
 and uh uh if you're going to use for a lifetime I suppose it's worth it 
 Because y- e- uh 
 I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself uh they won't last 
 And I've never had the bits sharpened 
 So That's a thing to consider is to 
 Yeah 
 And they they dull after awhile 
 Especially I did some cabinets in uh ash and oak
 and uh that that wears a bit down 
 We remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen
 And I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth 
 And uh routing hardwood will uh take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast 
 So 
 Right 
 That's uh 
 And then you take the blade to the to get sharpened right 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 Well I've used mine on treated wood 
 and now all my blades need sharpening Because uh treated wood will also chew them up
