 Okay 
 so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products
 Uh-huh
 I haven't had to 
 It's uh the 
 every so often 
 I mean I I I'm almost pushing it myself 
 Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's 
 and it shrinks too much 
 and say well I should have known better 
 I mean I bought it from G I Joe's
 and it was probably made in China by slaves
 But uh they uh 
 most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway I get pretty good stuff
 I think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized
 and if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find
 It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Huh
 Yeah 
 really
 Yeah 
 I think they're beginning to 
 The the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 I know 
 Still at it hey
 Wow
 Well they got a three year lead time 
 It probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so 
 The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer
 And can you think of any other industry where in software they 
 if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out you'll get a free version in the mail s- 
 Or uh maybe I say well you know you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade
 Yeah
 And the hardware well I mean all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity 
 and the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along
 Really 
 why don't they just say almost a Mac for half the price
 They'd sell more if they were honest
 Yeah it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S base
 Uh-huh
 Apple's sort of making a s- 
 and they're ones were 
 growling consumer uh need to worry about the Mac they're getting 
 like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back 
 They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive
 Yeah 
 I have one 
 I do desktop publishing at work 
 and I have a machine at home 
 and I belong to the user's group 
 and I I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out
 But uh technically I'm not actually in the industry 
 I don't work a computer company
 I'm an abuser
 But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know keep up with the changes as they happen
 Yeah
