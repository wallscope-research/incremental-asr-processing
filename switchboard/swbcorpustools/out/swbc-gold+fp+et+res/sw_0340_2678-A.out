 Uh so Jack what type of music do you like
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I enjoy classical too 
 I never really had listened to it till I I got married
 and and my wife uh enjoys it
 So I had never listened to it bef- till then 
 but now I listen to it well whenever she does 
 And even every once in a while I put it on myself you know
 Um wh- 
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 see those those are really nice 
 I like those
 Though I I couldn't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says This is Bach you know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that you w- 
 what you like 
 How about popular music
 Um Yeah
 Yeah 
 I'm pretty much the same way 
 You know people always say Wow Th- the meanings of those words
 And I'm always meaning 
 There's wor- well you know 
 I just thought they just all sort of rhymed you know
 Right 
 yeah 
 That whenever they say it two or three times
 I'm the same way 
 Yeah 
 It's funny uh depending on where you live 
 I I I commute back and forth between Baltimore and a rural town called Salisbury which is two and a half hours away 
 and the difference in the radio with popular music is totally different you know 
 when 
 Yeah 
 because Baltimore will play more uh what might be considered m- a little bit more progressive
 And as soon as you go down to Salisbury this town that's you know uh two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever uh in a real rural Balt- uh Maryland they it turns into ber- basically classic rock
 And they don't you know 
 Yeah 
 mostly oldies
 But classic rock {D you know with 
 if you know like when the Doors movie came out you know Doors was really on the radio there you know Where you know you'd hear was- one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in Baltimore 
 but in Salisbury you woul- that's all you would hear was This is the Doors you know
 So it was sort of a funny thing
 Y- 
 Yes 
 that's 
 I'm starting to realize that 
 I never really thought about that much 
 but there is
 Yeah 
 I never I never I didn't 
 I I lived in Pittsburgh before Baltimore 
 and I didn't I never really noticed the difference when I moved to this area
 I really didn't notice at all 
 It just seemed the same
 But when I went more rural you know that it really changed
 So 
 Oh does it 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah 
 Boy that would really be beneficial
 Because you never hear the you never hear the news basically on the radio 
 I never get it
 You know and if you don't if you don't read the paper you sort of fall behind if you're in the car all the time
 Yeah 
 that's pretty good
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 On fact my uh my grandmother does that a lot because she's blind 
 or what- she's losing her sight or whatever
 But 
 yeah 
 that of in 
 I can imagine you know if you're driving cross country you know uh listening to a story 
 S- 
 lot of the classics are really on tape
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's that would be good
 Well we strayed a lot from music
 But I but I guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening So as long you're listening 
 So 
 But if you do if you do have to go something I guess we can just cut off
 Well Jack it was nice to talk to you
 A- and good luck 
 and I hope you get some more calls and make some more calls
 Bye
