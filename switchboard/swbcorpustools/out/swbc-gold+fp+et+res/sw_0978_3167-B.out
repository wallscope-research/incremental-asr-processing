 Well I uh just had a Christmas Around The World party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres
 And I fixed uh a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy
 It's uh it's like uh eight ounces of cream cheese softened 
 and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice one tablespoon worcester sauce and mix it and spread it out onto a plate 
 And 
 Uh-huh
 And then you take and uh cover that with drained crab meat mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuits crackers
 And that always goes over real well 
 and it's real easy
 It's one of the small bottles
 I don't think uh 
 Well it's about eight ounces
 It it 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it would probably make 
 well it doesn't make quite as much as you think 
 but yeah 
 spread it out because you keep the cream cheese kind of thin
 One tin Of the flake 
 Uh-huh 
 And drain it real good
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I have 
 I used it uh last Christmastime 
 Uh what did I put it in 
 I think I just served it by itself 
 There's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 That's very true
 Very true 
 I had bought a cheesecake uh 
 and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be re frozen which I felt was real nice
 Yeah
 It uh was uh Lawry's I believe or Lawler's
 And I got it 
 do you have a Sam's Wholesale Warehouse up there 
 It's real 
 Yeah 
 okay 
 that's where I picked it up 
 It comes out of Chicago 
 and they're very good cheesecakes
 Yeah
 Yes 
 yes
 And they have and they have the little papers between them
 And I think they're what about nine dollars and something
 Yes
 Yes
 Yes
 Yes 
 it is frozen
 And I thaw it 
 and then you can re freeze it 
 And 
 Uh-huh
 It was they're very good very good 
 And that's the one thing that I hate to make is desserts
 Is it
 Oh I love to eat it 
 but I don't like to make it 
 It takes time 
 and you have to rack your brain
 and time I don't have anymore 
 Uh-huh 
 It is
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 And your mess 
 Yeah 
 Right
 Right
 That's that's right
 Well I like to have mine all done anyway because then I want to I want to party too 
 I don't want to sit in the kitchen and be putting an olive on something 
 You know
