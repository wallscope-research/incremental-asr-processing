 Right 
 right 
 And then when you read about that they're spending all the money on you know these studies that have no relevance whatsoever that kind of ticks you off too
 But uh somebody somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we're paying it's not that we mind paying taxes it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government
 And I I I tend to agree with that 
 I'm not really into what they're doing per se 
 and I think there's just too many too many levels of bureaucracy 
 I think it can be can be managed by less uh less levels
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Right 
 well I think we're going to see a streamlining in the government 
 I just you know 
 I I don't know what kind of uh I don't know what what level or what how long it will take for you know our country to start the public in general to start saying Hey this is too much We're not going to pay any more You know we're not going to pay for this 
 and you're out you know 
 I think we're starting to see it a little bit now 
 but I think uh I don't know what what kind of input we're going to get from the public and how they're going to go about doing it 
 Because I think I think we're just getting taxed way too much
 I mean right now we're getting taxed probably probably around thirty-five percent or more 
 And that's that's you know that's me not making a whole lot of money
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 we got a sales tax 
 Our sales tax is like eight percent 
 and I don't know what our gas tax is 
 I think it's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon
 So I mean they're hitting us up 
 and they may not raise it you know federally as much one year 
 but then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever 
 It's just I mean you can see that you're money is just not going that far
 Right
 Right 
 well I mean you could tell just by just by how much money you have left over 
 and all of a sudden I don't know it's just it's eating me alive
