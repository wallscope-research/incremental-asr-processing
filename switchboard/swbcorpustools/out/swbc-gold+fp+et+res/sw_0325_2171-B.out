 Well uh I don't have any strong convictions about it 
 that's for sure 
 Um I know I haven't done any Peace Corps service 
 and I don't know anybody in my immediate family that has or you know has ever even thought about it 
 Do you know uh do you know anybody that's been it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's definitely up to the person uh 
 so I'd have to say that uh it you know the people who do it well some feel it's rewarding 
 I don't know you know 
 but uh I don't know how we got the subject 
 I have nothing to say about this
 Uh-huh
 Well how long you been in San Antonio
 Um okay
 Oh okay
 <> And uh you you were just up there then huh
 Oh okay
 Well that's good
 Well it sounded like I mean this is like major long term commitment like a year or six months 
 or so you're looking at the Peace Corps or sabbatical maybe 
 or you know I don't know 
 I mean but uh 
 Uh-huh
 But that that time is minuscule compared to what what they were referring to
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 they couldn't cover my hourly rate 
 I couldn't afford it
 But uh 
 Yeah 
 Africa
 Yeah 
 well I doubt that 
 but you know how it is 
 W- I I mean it would it would have to be tough going somewhere you don't know the culture usually I guess
 I think that maybe that's why some people do it is uh to see the other cultures or you know and some of that
 But uh to do that I don't know 
 I'd have to be 
 I don't know
 Uh-huh Well you know uh I know American Express 
 I'm n- I'm working at American Express now 
 and they 
 after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off like six months or something for some type of sabbatical or some you know some something like that
 And they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off
 So it is something that I think uh you know even the larger organizations will support 
 Uh it's it's really for the community [ to give you know to to give ] back to the community type of thing
 I don't know 
 it's for I think at the same it's for some people to you know help them grow in other areas
 Yeah 
 m- 
 Yeah 
 maybe a little bit in that perspective 
 but uh and a lot of people have gone in the military I mean you know when they're in the college 
 Sometimes it's to sup- help support college you know the money 
 Uh others people don't know what they want to do 
 But as far as uh you know the Peace Corps I guess I suppose there's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives 
 But I think a lot of it's you know when the- people get older they'll do something like that
 Yeah
 I I I don't
 Didn't mean to cut you off there
 I 
 Yeah or or try to make a living
 But uh 
 yeah 
 I I have no I don't know anybody that's done that either 
 So I I 
 it's interesting we got this topic because I I I don't know what I marked off to get this 
 but 
 So you had the same one huh
 Oh well Well you'll you'll get it over with here 
 How many times have you talked
 Yeah
 Oh I've done maybe four or five
 Well she just sent me the information out 
 I I got a hold of it you know 
 I just sent it back in 
 and 
 What other topics have you had
 Great 
 great
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Yeah 
 I always I use everything with my Visa 
 and I pay it all off
 So that's a good deal for me 
 I get free money for thirty days
 That's the way I use them uh
 I try I try to make sure I don't get in debt 
 So 
 I had uh 
 let's see 
 I've had fishing 
 and uh I can't remember me and I think me and Dana had football 
 Yeah 
 we did
 Yeah 
 So we talked about the Cowboys a little bit 
 And I'm out here in Phoenix 
 so we talked about Phoe- Cardinals 
 And so so that one was all right 
 And then what else did I have 
 I think I had some other uh like staying in shape or working out 
 This other guy I got this guy from New York 
 so 
 And you've probably never gardened in your life 
 Yeah 
 I don't have too much of a green thumb either 
 So 
 I do have one plant here 
 it's been hanging out for a while 
 but I think it's one of the easiest plants 
 I can't I don't know the name of it 
 but I'm not too much into
