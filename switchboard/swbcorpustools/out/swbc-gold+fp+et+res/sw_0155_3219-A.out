 Okay 
 why don't you start 
 so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon
 Oh you are
 Oh wonderful 
 well how do you dress for work
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So you're in a church there
 Uh-huh 
 Well I'm working this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool 
 and they've told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds
 and they have a lot of uh they have BIBLE lessons 
 and they have all the things during the morning 
 but they still have snack time and play time 
 so I'm going to be dressing just in casual slacks and T-shirts probably not blue jeans but little bit short of that just just tennis shoes and play clothes
 Yeah
 I'm envious 
 Well it's a beautiful day here 
 and it's in the sixties 
 but we still have a lot of hot afternoons 
 it's supposed to be eighty-five today 
 so you'll still see people 
 it it's kind of an in between change that they're in their play clothes I mean they're in their summer clothes during the afternoons because you just can't stand the sweaters 
 but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly 
 Did you
 I understand
 Well so are the people around you um dressing similar to you
 Uh-huh 
 so you don't have to you don't have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do
 Well that's good
 That's good
 Uh-huh
 Well that's wonderful 
 Well my husband has to take the bus into Dallas and doesn't return all day 
 so he has to dress 
 and he just really hates it 
 they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit 
 and even when his job is not going to be with people all day long he said it's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I think that's I think that's great 
 I think that's good
 I understand
 Well another interesting thing on the our our end here is how even in my forties how much younger I dress than my mother would have in her forties 
 and I will run around to the store in things in slacks and tennis shoes 
 and she 
 Right 
 and pearls 
 and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school
 so uh she tells me I dress young 
 but that's okay 
 Well there's not a lot more I can think of to discuss on clothing
 I guess this is what you call a natural end 
 Well we wear 
 of course like I said if my husband's going downtown he's got the whole uh you know the dress men's dress shoes 
 but for as out here just anything that the moms 
 we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and and uh tights and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids
 Yeah 
 I'm sure they are there
 Yeah 
 I'm sure they are
 That's right 
 I'm sure that true 
 It's a lot different than working in a kids preschool
 That's right 
 Well you all have a nice day there
 Thank you very much
 Bye-bye
