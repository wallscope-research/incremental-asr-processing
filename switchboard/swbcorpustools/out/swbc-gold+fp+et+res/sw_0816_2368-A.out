 Uh what kind of house do you live in
 Oh yeah 
 With with a yard and fence
 I'm in an apartment in uh Plano
 Yeah 
 they are if uh 
 kind of depends on what you're looking for 
 Mine's just a one bedroom place 
 that's uh 
 Uh it's hard for me to tell because I haven't rented in uh probably twenty twenty-five years
 and uh just 
 I'm getting back into apartment life 
 and it's 
 Yeah
 Well they vary from place to place 
 it's hard to tell you know how well they've been kept up how old they are 
 and these are probably oh one of the nicest that I found 
 and uh they're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place
 Yeah 
 it does considering that you know you- uh house payments are not a whole lot more than that
 Yeah
 Wow that's a lot for a townhouse
 But that's what happens when you get up in this area you know you got all these companies are up here
 and these 
 and I guess they know they're going to get it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 you just take off your mortgage interest
 and that's about it
 Yeah 
 I've owned uh several built several
 Well and especially around North Dallas or at least in Plano area they they basically all look alike because Fox and Jacobs 
 Isn't it 
 I can remember 
 I've only been here eight years 
 but I can remember coming to work from 
 I used to live in Wylie
 and I could see downtown Dallas 
 and now there's this brown haze over it 
 and it's moving north
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it does 
 How long have you been in this house
 Ten years
 No 
 you really don't 
 Were you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than Dallas area
 How was it 
 how were the house prices up there
 Yeah
 Wow
 Oh yeah
 well you know a lot of these people that I've talked to that are coming down from uh like what I call the back East especially from J C Penney uh are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy-five thousand dollar houses down here 
 and they've wound up getting better houses here than they had there
 so in a way I guess it works both ways
 Yeah
 That's a fact
 I guess that's true
 And they don't have to worry about yard upkeep if they don't hardly have any
 That's true 
 there's not too many basements in Texas
 Yeah 
 gosh I remember when I was little uh we didn't have a 
 I lived grew up in southern Oklahoma
 and uh people across the street had a cellar 
 and we never did 
 and it's just like Dallas area it was tornado alley up there 
 and every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street 
 and we'd go into the cellar 
 and I to this day I don't care if I go or not 
 you know if it's going to get me it's get me
 Yeah
 You ever thought about building a house
 Have you ever thought about building a house
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 especially when 
 with T I it's like anybody else you never know how long you're going to be here be in one place you know
 Yeah
 Do you work
 Do you work
 Well how do you handle 
 do you have kids
 So you got 
 he's working and working to get this big house to take care of 
 how do you manage both of those
 Yeah
 You basically can take care of everything yourself
 Yeah
 Yeah
 What about home repairs and stuff 
 do you have to do all that yourself 
 or 
 Oh you too
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Sounds like you've already got the makings for being a general contractor
 If you don't wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together
 Yeah 
 I built three houses in my life 
 and Oh they 
 the building process was a lot of fun
 but puts a lot of strain on things
 Yeah
 You bet
 Oh you bet
 Oh yeah 
 Well to some of them I guess it doesn't matter you know that maybe they've got enough coming in to take care of it
 Are they they 
 as far as they're concerned they've come to the promised land 
 you know they've got it made
 Oh yeah 
 because you're combine- uh confined by space 
 you know I had a 
 I came out of a thirty-one hundred square foot two story house
 And I had room for everything 
 in fact I had more room than knew what to do with 
 I don't know
 just seems like room stuff always expands to fill available space 
 but uh Yeah 
 you can 
 you know you lear- you adjust you figure out
 It's not as bad as I thought it was
 it's not as bad as I remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be
 Uh there seems to be more a mature crowd in uh apartments at least where I am uh even though you know there's kids all around 
 and there's there's traffic 
 and there's people running up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that 
 but still uh 
 Yeah 
 pretty much 
 and uh there's never really any 
 oh I remember in school 
 there's just 
 seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night
 You don't run into that up here I think I think because there's so many uh professional people if you want to call them that that go spend all day at work 
 and they want to come home 
 and they want some quiet
 You see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes playing ball or jogging 
 or they're doing this and that 
 and they they're trying to to unwind
 Oh yeah 
 it's a hundred and what eighty thousand something like that
 Oh yeah
 Oh you bet 
 and the thing that that gets me is uh you never really catch up you never really finish doing things
 and uh you're always paying for something
 Oh you are constantly 
 there's always something going wrong
