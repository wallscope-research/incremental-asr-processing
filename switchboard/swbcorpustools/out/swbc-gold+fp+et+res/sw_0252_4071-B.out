 I agree 
 I think taxes are high
 Oh yes 
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Right 
 Yeah 
 I I agree 
 and I think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting 
 well if you do get money back from like jobs 
 I'm still a student so uh I only work part time 
 so I I get a check back 
 so 
 from from taxes 
 but 
 Yeah 
 It is 
 but it's not much 
 So 
 No
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 There you go 
 Right 
 yeah
 I don't know 
 I 
 don't seem like they are doing much with it 
 I mean there's plans there 
 and now that they are voting and people you know getting into drug and that stuff
 They have nice plans 
 and uh but they don't always work 
 and then you know they try to raise taxes more 
 and I don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work 
 you know but taxes get raise 
 so I don't know 
 I'm not really into politics uh
 I don't really understand it
 but it's just you know 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Huh
 Yeah 
 The could be nice 
 Huh
 Right 
 yeah
 Right 
 huh
 Yeah

 there is not much out there that is fair 
 that's for sure
