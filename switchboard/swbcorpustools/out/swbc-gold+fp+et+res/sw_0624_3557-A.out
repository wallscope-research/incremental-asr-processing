 Well AIDS is a nasty terrible disease 
 and you die from it 
 So I think that uh they need to look into it 
 and it's kind of like cancer 
 I don't you know 
 how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer
 I think it'll probably be as difficult 
 Uh how about yourself
 Yeah 
 they say a million people are infected with the H I V virus 
 and uh yeah 
 I think 
 Uh in the country America 
 Yeah
 and they have millions
 I don't know 
 I've just heard it on the radio
 Sometimes you hear things that on the radio that you know could be true or couldn't be
 Uh do you feel like this is 
 I I guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research
 Do you think they should spend more
 What do you think Doug of Mister Johnson
 Magic
 Do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of other a bunch of the media
 You know I took advantage of the opportunity when you know he came out 
 I talked to my kids about it you know
 it's something that I hadn't hadn't done before
 Uh
 I'm glad that Mister Johnson's changed his tune on uh safe sex to abstinence 
 or I was glad he did that for young kids because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting
 Uh let's see 
 What are some of the other questions 
 Uh you don't uh 
 let's see 
 I don't have any friends that have the disease 
 I guess you might might not
 Is it pretty nasty
 Yeah 
 it sounds awful
 Is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly 
 and 
 And 
 Oh really
