 The question was on lawn and garden work 
 Um how do you like it
 Oh what kind do you have 
 Do they really
 Oh
 Oh and I know somebody that lives there 
 and they never mentioned that problem 
 Oh my 
 They probably just take it for granted then
 Oh yuck 
 I don't have that problem uh 
 it's 
 mine is mainly 
 we kind of have an understanding that uh I I said I'll do inside work you do outside work
 And so I get into the gardening part of it the fun part like putting in the annuals and things like that
 But I don't like I don't like it dirty 
 No 
 I don't know 
 We got the we got the question 
 and I thought oh this is going to be interesting 
 Two bits I'll get a man to talk to me because they get stuck doing it all
 But although I do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work 
 And this year we put in a new lawn in a new home 
 so um we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall 
 Today we just had a lot of rain 
 Yeah 
 so it's kind of nice 
 I don't know how yours has been
 Oh I see
 Okay 
 Well we're leaving tomorrow 
 and we're going down to New Orleans 
 and from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie 
 this is going to be a switch for us for a week going down there 
 and I think we'll probably experience some of your weather although I think they have more humidity 
 But um as far as the gardening and things like that goes I don't know uh too much too much about uh how much I really r- do enjoy it myself 
 Do you like it at all
 Well how about when you were in Colorado
 Uh-huh
 Well and then too now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly My water bill was high 
 And uh if you have that on a regular basis in Texas I think I would go with something very dry to keep it off you know
 But uh and with children um you probably don't have time anyhow to to get into it
 It's so uh okay very good
 I guess we've kind of covered our subject matter since neither one is really into gardening are we 
 Right 
 Okay
 Right
 Nice talking with you
 Uh-huh 
 bye
