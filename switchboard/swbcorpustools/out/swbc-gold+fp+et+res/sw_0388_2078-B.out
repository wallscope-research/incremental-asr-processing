 Okay
 Oh you found that out tonight
 I haven't even heard that 
 that's great 
 I think he deserves every penny of it
 But there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting
 Oh yeah
 And they play a lot they play a lot longer season too
 Yeah 
 that's exactly right
 But I think let's see 
 the teams that were there last year were <> see somebody from California 
 I don't even know who won the pennant last year
 Yeah 
 Not lately though 
 Uh-huh
 Threw it away 
 Oh gosh 
 Let's see 
 The teams that 
 I think the A's were in it last year 
 The Oakland A's and I think it was I don't think it was an all California baseball
 I played softball
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's fun 
 That's a whole different sport
 Yeah 
 let's see 
 but I think I think the Rangers need to go 
 and I think the Pirates will go 
 And uh let's see 
 <> Rangers have got a new guy this year 
 I don't even remember his name either
 Every once in a while I I like to go on the nights when there's not anybody out there not very many people out there 
 It's a lot more fun when your not fighting a crowd
 Yeah 
 B- 
 sometimes when I if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun
 Yeah
 It is 
 And do you know anything about that new stadium 
 have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there
 Yeah 
 that that huge 
 it's suppose to be a huge stadium 
 and it's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it 
 And uh they're going to try to make it a real community center out there 
 Cou- 
 That's that's in uh Texas stadium where the football players play 
 and they're never going to let liquor in there
 I know 
 but they try every year 
 and every year they get thrown out 
 It's so stupid because they let you take it in there 
 but they don't they don't allow you to sell it don't allow them to sell it there
 But uh that new stadium's going to be real nice 
 and I heard that there's uh that you can bid on that stadium 
 last night on the news I heard that they said you could you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you 
 so 
 And it's going to go to the highest bidder 
 Yeah 
 so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame
 Oh
 Oh God I stay away from them
 I bet you do
 In Plano
 Oh you are
 Oh what's he teach
 Uh-huh 
 So what do you do
 Oh you do
 Is that a tough system to be in
 Real hard
 Yeah 
 I would think it
 Yeah
 That's typical bureaucracy though
 That's that's I think it's going to be any where you go 
 it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones
 I don't know 
 sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad
 Yeah
 but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes
 You don't even know who to payoff huh 
 Yeah 
 oh how funny
 No communication whatsoever
 Yeah
 I know
 And you never see it
 That's got to be frustrating
 How long you taught taught in Dallas schools
 Ugh that's about uh ten too many
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh
 Oh well that's not bad
 But hasn't it changed a lot over the years
 Yeah
 Or working in the system
 Oh God 
 How funny
 Yeah 
 you don't know which is you don't know which is worse
 Yeah 
 I guess so 
 Yeah 
 being told what to do is worse
 So how long are we suppose to talk for
 Oh you can
 Oh I haven't ever talked that long
 Uh-huh 
 He lives in Cleveland
 Wow
 Yeah
 Huh
 Th- yours is my second one
 Did she did she did you all not talk about the topic at all
 Oh
 Oh gosh all the other 
 the one I talked about the other night was good 
 it was um about movies you know what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that
 Me too because we go all the time 
 the guy I was talking to never goes 
 he was boy it sounds like your really up on this 
 I said I see at least two a week 
 So that was real good to talk about that 
 Have you seen like uh SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
 You've got to go see that
 Yeah 
 we talked about that one too 
 And he he said he didn't think it should have gotten all those awards he thought it was too long 
 but I 
 I did too
 Yeah 
 I didn't think it was too long at all 
 Uh he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch
 The other one you need to go see is SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY
 And how old are your kids
 You probably don't want to take them to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 
 It's it's not it's not too cool for kids
 I bet they do
 Yeah 
 they want to see all the horror movies
 Yeah 
 Ninja Turtles got to have those
 Oh yeah 
 you brin- 
 that's 
 well heck that's a lot cheaper then uh taking them out to the show
 Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one ni- one time
 Yeah
 Of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything decent
 That's true
 That's true 
 We saw um HEROES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COWBOYS tonight
 It was okay 
 it was kind of slow 
 and I felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end you know 
 It just it 
 I don't know 
 it one of those movies it's not going to be around long 
 it will be a dollar movie in no time
 Not very much 
 no
 I don't have the patience to read 
 Yeah 
 Oh my Mom and Dad read all the time
 Yeah 
 sure did
 Oh really
 Who is the is the author
 Oh 
 Shoeless Joe 
 Was it like the movie
 Okay
 Right
 Huh
 I didn't 
 see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie 
 That's interesting 
 That was a good movie too
 I think so
