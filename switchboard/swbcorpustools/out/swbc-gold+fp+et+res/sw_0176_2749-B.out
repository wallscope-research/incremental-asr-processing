 Uh not at all 
 In fact I'm graduating from college in about a week
 and this past semester I've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials
 Uh I think I think uh s- the system right now you know should you know is fine 
 I think it should be by a jury 
 I don't think the judge should have I mean 
 he's just there kind of like the referee 
 Uh I don't I don't even think that it should be unanimous either Uh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Exactly
 Uh-huh 
 Uh I don't know 
 I uh 
 you you rarely hear you hear of course there's cases where someone has been put in in in uh prison uh falsely accused 
 but uh more than likely the people that are on the the jury know what they're doing 
 Uh I mean you 
 Never
 Huh Well you would think that they would get that in the uh 
 when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out 
 and I I know they automatically 
 when you go through uh when you're chosen is you're automatically like a a a professor in criminal justice or something like that 
 that you're automatically 
 no 
 they don't want you on the jury
 Exactly
 Uh-huh 
 exactly 
 Uh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I've I've never I've never even been called to jury duty
 Yeah 
 I uh <> I don't know 
 I think the I guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Ri- 
 I uh I do- I I don't think the judge should just make the decision alone
 Least with the jury you have twelve people you know that are going to decide you know 
 you're the the person's fate
 *[[ This really is part of utt1 ]] Exac- 
 judge 
 Right 
 exactly 
 Probably 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 But uh no 
 it's it's sad though that uh that the people though that 
 you you somebody's life is in twelve people's hands 
 and sometimes those twelve people could care less
 And uh or they fool the the defense in thinking that they're you know 
 because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want
 Exactly
 Uh-huh 
 Oh yeah 
 Well 
 I guess it's just that maybe people are you know upset at court you know 
 If it was if it was a a family member of theirs though that was innocent 
 and then they'd want to be on that jury
 But uh if everyone would take it I think if everyone took it seriously 
 and uh I mean something you have to do 
 *[[ This really seems to be just a continuation of B68 not an indep slash unit ]] Yeah
 I would love to be called 
 I'm ready to go 
 They just haven't called me up yet 
 It was nice talking to you
 Bye-bye
