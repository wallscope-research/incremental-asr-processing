 All righty 
 I think one of the most significant changes that have happened is that they've changed from homemaker to the work market And for several reasons 
 Probably some of that is divorce 
 and some is they're more educated than they used to be I think
 Uh I think sometimes uh leaders in government they've become more uh adroit in that area too instead of just men all the time
 We have more women in government
 And now I'll let you say something 
 Very limited
 Uh-huh 
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 I think that's right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 I really think women have so much more responsibility than you know as far as everything
 And like you said uh one women today have so many uh 
 the average today of having a a single family you know with the mother as the head you know it just really uh so commonplace nowadays 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh 
 You know isn't that funny uh because the same thing happened to us except I was twelve 
 And my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession
 and was 
 isn't that funny Uh but just that they were able to do it you know 
 and even today I think the chance for education is j- is is so much uh better for all of our girls and and boys too 
 But but the girls especially
 A lot of things 
 yeah
 Right 
 Yeah 
 And I also think that in the future that uh it's going to continue 
 We're not going to see a lax off of women in the work force
 I think they're going to stay there 
 and I think that they're going to uh uh be really responsible and and do everything just like what you said you know make make it the grade and and make it so women can be the top people in their in their field
 Oh I think so
 Right
 Right
 Exactly
 Exactly
 That's right 
 And I think that is happening more and more
 I think it's just going to take a little bit longer
 Well great 
 okay
 Good to talk to you Sally
 Thanks
 Bye-bye
