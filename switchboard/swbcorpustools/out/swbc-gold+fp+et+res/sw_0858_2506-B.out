 We talking from from dents in the holes
 I understand 
 we've got I've got a daughter
 Kids are hard on houses
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Uh we live in a mobile home 
 and that's probably not typical America 
 but 
 it's 
 what we have 
 it's all we can afford
 And uh seems like we're always working on it as I'm sure it is with your house
 Yeah

 So you know just like yours ours is always you know 
 we're 
 something else goes wrong always you know

 What division are you in
 Oh
 It's not a hobby you know 
 it's something to do 
 I get to here about Texas again a bit and get to talk to people all over the country 
 you know that I've talked to someone in Maryland I believe it was
 It's interesting isn't it
 You know the gal I talked to in Maryland didn't own a car 
 she's never traveled anywhere 
 she's never been anywhere 
 she you know 
 I talked about one of the biggest problems in the United States being our roads 
 and she didn't understand 
 She doesn't drive
 Uh she uh lives on campus 
 she's a college student 
 Buses and and uh public transportation
 Her her parents live by the public transportation
 Well it would be nice 
 but I kind of like the freedom too don't you
 Right
 If it's anything like uh 
 Dallas always has been 
 no one wants to be at downtown Dallas much
 Is the crime rate still bad
 Huh
 Huh
 Yeah
 Huh that's terrible
 So Garland how nice is it now 
 it's been a while since I've been there
 Yes 
 it has
 Well yeah 
 it is
 Where you from
 Kilgore 
 I know where Kilgore is
 I'm I'm originally from Lubbock
 Yeah
 Seemed like the thing to do at the time
 Oh I love it the mountains 
 I love the mountains
 uh back to the topic
 it seems that uh more and more people are not owning traditional homes these days
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 uh everyone says you know 
 when I bought this several years ago when our local economy was good everyone said no no you're crazy to buy a mobile home
 But now it seems that uh with the local economy bad and T I 
 and strange it seems that uh 
 Oh they're doing some back pedaling
 No 
 I'm renting at the time 
 so 
 Gosh
 Yeah
 Well mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one
 Ours is wood s- ours is wood sided 
 and it has a traditional V top roof 
 and uh it's nine hundred and eighty square foot 
 What two bedroom one bath rooms are nice sized 
 Well you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into two bedrooms one bath
 it's it's comfy
 Yes
 I don't know whether it is or not 
 It was already setup when we bought it
 Oh yeah 
 it's wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere 
 and uh you know so it's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be
 Oh our payments are like two twenty
 Fifteen
 And uh what
 Yeah 
 oh yes 
 A mobile home's a heck of a lot cheaper 
 and well actually whenever we got ours we picked it up used you know three or four years used and uh Well yeah 
 it did
 No 
 no 
 no 
 what I meant not in quality 
 what I meant was four years equity costs five hundred dollars
 So you know there's not that much time left on the loan 
 and 
 I don't know
 Uh to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for 
 You know it's like me to pickup and move somewhere else somewhere else is easy
 Sure
 Sure 
 absolutely
 Oh absolutely 
 When I you know when you talk about the deal like I got yeah yeah it would be cheaper 
 Uh especially if it were a paid move or something 
 You know there's some paid moves occasionally
 I don't know 
 but they did 
 when I when I moved up here 
 so they might want to move away
 Uh six or seven
 Uh a little bit little bit 
 mostly I just love walking in the mountains driving in the mountains
 Oh that's exciting
