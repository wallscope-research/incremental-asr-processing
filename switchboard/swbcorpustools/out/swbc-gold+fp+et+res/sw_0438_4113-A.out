 Uh so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I agree uh with with both of those things 
 but uh do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh the only prob- the only problem I see with term limitations uh is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that there's a very lar- you know there there is a learning curve and that you know you d- can't just send someone off to Washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective uh Congress person 
 Uh I think I think there really is a there's a lot they need to learn you know when you get there
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh the other the other thing that uh bothers me about our system is just that uh in for for in in in Congress the amount of power any any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there 
 so it's you know for you know uh 
 so unless you have actual you know across the board s- uh limitations the uh you know the idea of 
 well we're going to just we're 
 I'm I'm just going to you know vote vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work 
 you know it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh Uh-huh
 Uh-huh <>
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well I mean l- 
 t- 
 I don't see why it makes a big difference the C I A because you know officially they don't do they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
