 Well Sid 
 have you established what kind of requirements you are looking for for your next vehicle
 Okay 
 Well I I tend to be more methodical I guess 
 Uh I determine first of all what I'm going to use the vehicle for whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a a personal mover Uh where it's going to be driven you know what types of uh driving I'm going to be doing on it primarily highway or or local mileage more often 
 And uh hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that I tend to drive cars for about ten years and a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles
 So I'm I'm real picky 
 I- if you are going to keep something that long you know you better get something that you wanted to begin with and that you are going to like for a long time
 Sure 
 Well it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways also then
 That's true 
 Uh do you have more than than one vehicle in your fleet 
 Uh do you have a family fleet 
 or 
 Well that may be 
 They Chrysler made some really good old engines back then 
 like the the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine
 Yeah 
 At the moment I've got uh Cadillac Cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a uh reasonably new Plymouth Voyager 
 It's only a a couple of years old 
 But that's the second one of of those that we've had 
 and that's the the family travel vehicle 
 You know not only does it do all the the uh carpooling around during the week 
 but it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in 
 I think that what I'm getting ready to get next is probably a Suburban unless they drastically change the the vehicle a lot 
 Uh I'm just getting tired of when I do get hung up in traffic not being able to determine what the problem is and and come to some resolution of whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit and that kind of stuff Just because I can't see you know 
 I'm to my Cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that I can't see past any vehicle that's in front of me
