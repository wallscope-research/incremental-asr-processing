 Well normally when we go on vacation we go home to Colorado
 Really 
 Yeah 
 Colorado Springs is where we're from
 How funny
 Really
 We live up up uh Lake in the Broadmoor area
 that's where my fam- my in-laws are
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 as of you can't even ski there anymore
 Yeah 
 they closed it down
 Uh-huh
 they don't have enough money to keep it going 
 it doesn't doesn't pay 
 So 
 Well you know well now I don't know 
 Now Colorado Springs is real accessible to Lake Breckenridge
 it's only a couple of hours away 
 And uh so it's it might not be too bad if you want to go skiing somewhere else 
 But you can't can't ski up there any more
 Oh I'd like to go on vacation 
 I c- my husband and I want to go to Florida to go to Disney World 
 but we have two little ones that are under two right now 
 so we want to wait until they're a little bit older to do that 
 and 
 Oh
 Well how fun
 Oh yeah
 Oh I bet
 Wow 
 well that sounds pretty Yeah that sounds pretty good
 And it was all a big package deal where you just pay one price and get everything
 Really
 Wow
 Oh what a deal
 Great
 Well that's great
 Oh
 Yeah 
 I bet 
 That sounds like the way I'd want to do it I think
 Oh well we like to ski of course 
 so we spend so much time with our families uh and seeing our friends 
 because we moved to Texas about two years ago So when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do
 so we don't we don't get a lot of time to just vacation 
 We did um last year though go to San Antonio for Memorial Day which was fun just to get to kind of walk around and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing 
 Uh but you know other other than that with with both my kids being under two it's real hard to do any any kind of events that uh don't don't require as much
 Yeah 
 That's [ funny + *[[needs slash because A asks what was said before B repeats word "funny"]] funny ] 
 you should mention that 
 I just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it
 Uh-huh
 Oh do you live where do you 
 what state are you in
 Oh you're in Texas
 So am I
 I'm in Garland
 Yeah
 I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or something the other day
 Yeah 
 so I guess they get people from all over
 Yeah
