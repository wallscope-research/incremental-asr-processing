 Well there's been a lot of publicity lately about that new Nancy Reagan book out by uh Kitty Kelly the unauthorized biography 
 Are you interested in that at all
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Well I the reason why I was thinking about looking at it is because it's supposed to 
 I'm not a fan of Nancy Reagan 
 and so it's supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it 
 And I thought just purely for entertainment I might enjoy that 
 But I I wouldn't want to go out and buy it like you know the hard back copy of it
 But I might check
 Really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 In biographies 
 Well I uh I have read some biographies 
 I prefer to read 
 if I read a biography it's mostly because maybe I have to uh you know 
 back when I was in school I had to have information about that person or um preparing some kind of lesson 
 and I need to have more information about people 
 But I I do like to read some biographies 
 but that one just sounded like gossipy 
 And I wouldn't want to sit down and just read it cover to cover but flip through just for just to get a good laugh
 Uh-huh
 Was it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 A while 
 Uh-hum 
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Well I like the classics too 
 Uh I think that there's a lot of books out now that are kind of garbage books 
 And I well I don't prefer to read a lot of the things like you might find at uh well like at a Target or a supermarket or something where they have a bunch of books out paperback type books 
 Usually I I'm going to the book store for a particular reason uh
 Yes 
 Yes 
 and and uh I buy some of the not self-improvement books but uh self-help books 
 like we just bought a new house 
 so I bought a couple of books about how to buy a house and what to look for you know And or how to repair this or repair that in your own home 
 I bought that for my husband 
 And or how to how to do something books you know for reference 
 And uh and those are really helpful I think in helping um 
 well you know like some w- symptoms medical symptoms like when how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not type books which I use as reference and have been real handy 
 But purely just for enjoyment 
 I I had a major in English and linguistics 
 and so I ha- have a lot of books in my home that I can read from the classics 
 and I do enjoy those quite a bit 
 And um so I tend to for reading just day to day uh you <> know I have a particular book I'm looking for 
 or I just enjoy uh you know the newspaper magazine
 It's handy
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Light reading 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Well I think that's good because you do have to use your mind and imagine up the circumstances and things 
 It's not like uh most television where you you know you just you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but still understand what was going on
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Not too much 
 Not too much 
 Well that's right 
 Well I think it is good to to read books and + and because even if it's like you say it's light reading you are still getting some uh mental exercise 
 Right 
 That's right
 That's good
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 I think so 
 Well I guess I'd better close now so I can 
 Uh Well I I was 
 I'm home now full time
 But uh so yeah 
 we're we think books are important around here
 Well you have a good day
 Stay out of the rain
 Bye-bye
