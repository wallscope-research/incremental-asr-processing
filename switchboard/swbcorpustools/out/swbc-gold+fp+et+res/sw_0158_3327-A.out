 Do you repair your own car
 Well I tell you what that's y- count your blessings because uh it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves
 Well that's why I don't do as much as I'd like
 Because they are I mean they've got they've gotten complicated haven't they 
 Uh-huh
 Is that right
 Yeah 
 I I agree 
 About all I ever 
 I never was too mechanically inclined 
 but I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and 
 Course they don't use uh points anymore
 But Uh they do still use plugs
 And uh now brakes I've always done a lot of you know changing brakes
 And I used to do I could always do the alternator you know and starter
 I don't anymore 
 but I have on a lot a lot of times
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 It probably slipped loose didn't it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Oh
 Y- 
 well it really wasn't quite s- as bad as you thought was it was it 
 Well it was a lot of money 
 but 
 You had to have the help didn't you
 Yeah 
 Well do you still do much work on them then
 Disposal is a problem
 That's true
 That's true
 Right 
 that that 
 I've I've quit doing that myself
 And but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil you know
 And uh but it

 I guess i- 
 that 
 and the main reason that it's it's quick
