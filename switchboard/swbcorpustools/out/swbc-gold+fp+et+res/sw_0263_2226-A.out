 Uh books
 Mainly I read the Bible these days
 Good that's great to hear 
 Uh and Christian literature 
 Uh I've kind of 
 I used to read a lot of uh novels 
 but it seems as though if you really want to set a t- side time to read the Bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading
 And I I been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible in my heart 
 and he really has 
 It's getting to where a just really want to read it

 And it's like uh uh usually about a family of uh archaeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into like uh uh digging in old ruins and running across like uh the old gods and things
 Yeah 
 it is 
 It's real exciting
 And it also teaches them spiritual warfare you know 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Well it's hard for me
