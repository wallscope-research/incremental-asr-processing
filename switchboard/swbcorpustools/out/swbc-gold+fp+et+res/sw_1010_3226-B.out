 I say yes
 Yes 
 Mother lives in Florida 
 and there are in her subdivision there are fifty percent Canadians who won't give up their Canadian citizenship because of the health insurance
 It's wonderful
 Oh 
 Well 
 Well even if that's 
 so you know really when you look at it they have full coverage 
 they have H M O which you know after you get used to it it's not too bad 
 and uh everything is covered
 and we have so many people in the United States that we spend 
 well in my family alone we spent four thousand dollars in July on medical bills
 insurance didn't cover a penny 
 Yeah
 Yes 
 it is horrible
 Yeah 
 but 
 Uh if you're healthy it's fine 
 but I had two kids in the hospital in July
 Yeah 
 but you know Richardson School District has the H M O
 and ninety percent of the doctors you would choose are on that list
 Yeah
 McCullum is
 McCullum is
 Uh-huh
 Well but that's that's a screw up in an appointment you know 
 I'm going back to the days when I was pregnant
 and I had two doctors 
 and one was my favorite personality wise
 but when I delivered Ronnie he was not on call
 the other guy delivered him
 you know and that 
 and you know if um I go to Townsend 
 he's got a new partner 
 I go to both of them now 
 You know I have no choice because when I want to go if Dr Howe or whatever his name is is on duty I go to him
 Well no 
 we need to cut some of our spendings cut some of the fat off the top and whittle it down to the rest of us
 No
 No
 Yeah
 But you known Ronnie in Austin went to a program and went to a social worker
 and at the same token there is something 
 because he can get his pills for two dollars when I'm paying fifteen on my medical insurance
 and he can get free medical care but he has to go to the city hospital instead of seeing David and so again you know 
 we went through it Ronnie's home tonight 
 and we talked about it and said you know is it worth it 
 Yeah 
 you know he pays forty-five dollars a month for his prescriptions where he could pay six dollars
 So there are programs you know if you get on Medicare or Medicaid or one of those
 Yeah
 That's what I read
