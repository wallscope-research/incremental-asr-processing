 <> I've heard some about Saturns 
 I don't know a lot about them 
 I haven't been over uh to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight's paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the I guess the Japanese cars 
 *[[comment on trans delete line]] Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Um Yeah 
 I've heard a lot of people like them 
 Uh yet I don't know wh- whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point 
 I'm kind of 
 my card and uh desires tend to be pretty picky 
 and so uh 
 Well let's see 
 I li- I like cars that are designed with with human beings in mind
 and that's not just the driver and the passenger 
 but that's the person who's working on it 
 cause I do al- almost all my own maintenance and uh those types of things 
 And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in uh finding a ca- car anymore that's that's fairly easy for me to work on it's just not very eas- it's not very 
 almost unlikely at this point
 And uh yo- 
 Ooh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well I've got an eighty-three Saab
 And I find that for a normal you know everyday things It's really very easy to work on 
 and so uh you know I'm kind of spoiled 
 I used to have a Chevy
 With a three fifty in it
 And uh I really liked working on it Uh cause it was pretty easy too 
 It was about a nineteen seventy 
 So I'm kind of uh biased in that 
 and you know I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore
 And that's kind of that's that's probably one thing I'd look at 
 I think another thing I'd look at is safety
 Huh 
 That's a real nice car I think
 I've driven some uh Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips Uh as rental cars 
 And I've always been very impressed with the Taurus 
 It's a really nice car 
 I think it's very it's a stylish car both inside and out 
 It's comfortable to drive 
 Uh reasonable performance 
 and this is out in California where where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore
 Uh I've been real impressed with that 
 Yo- 
 and I didn't realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh I think that That's excellent 
 That's excellent because 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Sure 
 Those are 
 yeah 
 that that would be a good deal to go with 
 Okay 
 Uh-huh 
 What do you what do you looking for in in those 
 What what attracts you to the Saturns 
 Or or of course we've already talked you know 
 the Taurus is safe 
 But wh- what kind of things are you looking for 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Okay
