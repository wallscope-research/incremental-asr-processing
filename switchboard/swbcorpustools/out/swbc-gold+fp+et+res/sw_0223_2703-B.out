 Okay 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 I'm a big baseball fan too
 E- 
 well I like 
 I teach school 
 and so during the school year I just don't have time to read 
 And I you know I would love to to be able to read more because I I enjoy it so much 
 But with correcting papers and and I two o- kids of my own I just don't have time 
 But in the summer I try to read a lot
 And and of course being a woman I like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot 
 I just 
 I really enjoy that because it's kind of a a getaway type thing
 So I I read a lot of that 
 But I also love sports 
 And uh uh I I don't have time to read in 
 but I do read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED i- during the the year because my son gets that 
 And uh but uh I don't read a lot of nonfiction 
 and I really should because there's so many self-improvement books out right now that would would be benefit me greatly 
 but I just don't 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Oh do you
 Uh-huh 
 Oh my word
 Yeah 
 It's i- 
 some of those books are real tough to get into 
 but after you get into them they're really good
 But it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so
 Yeah
 It's right 
 that's right 
 I find though that if when I find an author 
 uh and you don't read a lot of fiction you said 
 But when I find 
 Do you
 When I find an author I really like I try to read everything they write Because you you get used to their style and you really enjoy it
 Uh-huh 
 I've heard of him
 Is that right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books about science fiction 
 I think that's unbelievable
 Oh does he really
 Oh <>
 Is that right
 Is that right
 Uh-huh 
 Well I I've never read anything of his 
 but I've heard about him 
 But wouldn't you think he would 
 does he get some royalties from that hopefully 
 Well I would think he would 
 Oh I'm sure he is 
 I'm sure he is 
 But sometimes the more you get the more you want too 
 so 
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 Oh right 
 right 
 right 
 I in fact I'm a sports fan period
 We 
 I mean th- that's why I like to read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED so much 
 because there's everything in it
 Oh 
 So you're probably uh a Baltimore fan right an Oriole fan
 Is that right
 Boston 
 Oh well that's good too
 I'm I'm sure you do 
 Well I'm a Ranger fan simply because I live here
 But I I was uh 
 I'm not from here 
 I'm originally from Ohio 
 so I've always followed the Tigers Because you know I was I was born and raised in Toledo 
 Yeah 
 Oh I love the Mud Hens 
 They're great 
 I love the name 
 and there was a b- really big article on the Mud Hens in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED last year
 Did you
 Yeah 
 I li- 
 I really enjoy that team 
 I we used to go there all the time 
 I used to live in Iowa too 
 and they have the Iowa Oaks 
 And we used to go go to their games all the time 
 And 
 I know I know they don't 
 Oh they must they must have changed then Because it used well 
 I haven't lived there for l- 
 I've been here for like twelve years now 
 so And I haven't been back to Des Moines in a long time 
 But we used to always go to their games 
 and it was kind of fun 
 It's almost uh more fun than going to a major league game 
 I don't know 
 I just really enjoy the farm teams 
 Yes 
 it is 
 It's not quite so serious you know
 That's for sure 
 that's for sure
 Is that right
 Is that right 
 Well how like how much is an Oriole game
 Oh gosh 
 See it's higher than the Rangers
 Oh yeah 
 A- 
 the food here is outrageous 
 But uh you can get a good seat for uh well 
 it used to be three dollars 
 But I think it's gone up to fo- four dollars this year
 But you know it's in the bleachers way out in the you know in center field 
 but it's still nice
 You still can see well 
 And uh we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets you know box seats or something then we usually sit out there
 Box seats run from oh like eight dollars to twelve dollars
 Oh so it'll go up
 Uh-huh
 Oh oh
 Uh that's yeah that's a bummer
 Well see baseball here though is the cheapest game in town Because the Cowboys 
 it's out- it's outrageous to go to the Cowboy game 
 And the Mavericks are t- 
 it's high too
 So baseball's cheap compared to other games
 Well that didn't go s- over now 
 They they they decided you know George Bush who who's the main owner of the Rangers decided that uh they'd stay in Arlington 
 So Arlington's going to build a stadium a bigger one
 So we're going to they're going to stay there Which is fine because Arlington's got a lot of things to offer 
 And and that was their main main money making you know deal for the city 
 And it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away
 Because everything 
 there's Six Flags right by the stadium there's a Wet 'n Wild 
 and and it you know that's 
 all the tourists come there
 And and they 
 it would have been devastated 
 they would have collapsed 
 So I'm kind of glad they're staying there Because it's right in the middle of Fort Worth-Dallas 
 and you know 
 Yeah 
 We you know we I like it there 
 And I think Dallas has enough to offer that they don't have to hog everything 
 So I'm glad that they're staying in Arlington
 And it's takes us maybe uh we- well thirty-five to forty minutes to get there from Plano which is not too bad at all
 Yeah
 So 
 Is that right
 Uh-huh
 Oh gosh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Well not really 
 Now my son does 
 I have I have a son that just turned sixteen
 and he reads everything he gets he gets his get his hands on 
 He's reading a Dick Vitelle book right now because he's a real big Dick Vitelle fan
 He's a basketball fan because he he plays for the high school he goes to 
 and uh just loves D- Dick Vitelle which not many people do 
 So but he's reading it 
 and he's r- 
 and he says He's so interesting Mom 
 You just can't believe all the things he's done
 And he's really enjoying that 
 And I 
 and he said Mom you need to read it after I get finished 
 So maybe I will
 I never heard that one
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I'll have to tell my son about that 
 I'm sure he'd like it
 Oh that would be good
