 Well uh this is this is about drug testing right
 Well uh I'm I'm certainly under the uh uh the influence of the idea that that the government needs to have less control on what uh what the citizens do 
 although I do see this as a uh something that definitely needs to be taken care of 
 Whether that whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or the the hands of the hands of the government is a you know a a different question I think as far as I'm concerned 
 I- 
 in in other words I am fa- in favor of drug contro- or or or drug testing 
 Uh I was drug tested when I came to my job here at T I 
 [ [ Yet but ] + but ] at the same time I don't think uh that should be governed by by the government uh per se 
 I think it should be more by the private institution 
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Sure
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I I agree with you 
 I you know I would even think that uh uh I could in theory take that a l- a you know a step further and say anybody in any job you know if the corporation felt like uh b- b- 
 and this is why I mean uh drugs are the biggest problem I think to face America today 
 I mean i- th- it's what drives crime 
 it's what drives uh uh any sort of of uh uh pain and discomfort in the world or in America I think is some- is somewhat uh uh driven by drugs 
 and I think that uh were corporations and uh private industry to take uh take command in this situation that maybe maybe we might have some some control over that 
 We you know 
 if you can't work then you can't be a little bit harder to take take drugs or whatever 
 I don't know
 Course that might up crime you know when uh people go in and steal your television and ste- and sell it just because they can't they can't work anymore you know
 Definitely 
 you you're definitely right 
 That uh you can't you can't have it any other way
 Uh you know whether whether in in the case that you brought up you know whether uh you know w- 
 if it's a policeman and he's working with uh the public and he has a and has a gun in his holster or or even you know if it's a guy at McDonald's cooking a burger I think they're dangerous in either situation
 Uh I 
 what what do you think uh 
 what percentage of of corporations and uh private industry do you think use uh drug testing
 Oh really
 Uh-huh
 Right
 What kind of work are you in
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 and did they give you drug testing
 Oh
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Oh so are they going to uh begin spontaneous uh drug testing
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 What do you think about uh you know 
 something that kind of concerns me is uh y- you know you and I are tested for for whatever work we happen to do 
 Do you think there should be drug testing for political officials
 Yeah 
 I do too
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Sure 
 sure 
 yeah
 I would agree with you 
 I I can't see I can't see how we can expect the you know uh uh people working in the in in America to uh to put any trust into our political officials if they don't you know uh 
 just doesn't make sense to have them i- to to worry about legislation unless they're doing that themselves
