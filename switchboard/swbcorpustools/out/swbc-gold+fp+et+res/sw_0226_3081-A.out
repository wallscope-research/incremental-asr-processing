 Okay 
 well I I I guess if I was having a dinner party I depending on the number of people I might cook a like a brisket or a roast or a maybe a chicken dish
 and um I guess I usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a a potato dish 
 and we usually serve fresh fruit and uh then make a dessert
 So that makes 
 Well that sounds good
 That sounds good
 Bread do you have bread to go with it
 Gosh
 Oh well lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds
 I've heard you know I've heard a lot of people say it the short cut on the cooking for lasagna 
 they they've told me that they go to Sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna
 So 
 Did you
 Well I I know people that have have served it 
 and they say gosh if you have company coming when you don't want to be always in the kitchen it's easy 
 and she said it's they said it's good
 So that that's always sounds good to me um
 I feel like I feel like I'm in the kitchen cooking a lot
 I cook guess I cook a seems like I cook a lot of dinners oh not always for company just for just for family
 So feels like I'm often in the kitchen
 But a time consuming place
 Yeah 
 right 
 right 
 so 
 I don't know 
 what that is 
 No 
 I don't know what that is
 Okay
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Right 
 Do you like to make your own guacamole
 Yeah 
 we we don't make it very often I guess 
 but uh 
 Oh do they
 Gosh
 Gosh
 Oh that's good 
 that's good 
 or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich
 Oh well we made I made guacamole that I would take to a pool party across the street the other day 
 and and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad
 Well I don't know 
 I guess they don't have it at home
 They must they just said they never had it at home 
 So I I was concerned that I thought oh taking this you know taking this as a dip I thought gosh you know sometimes when we have it at home it it turns dark on the top so quickly 
 so I just 
 Oh does that help
 Okay 
 well 
 Well I'll have to remember that 
 Well I just I that day I just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top 
 and it really stayed longer than I ever thought it would 
 so 
 I thought maybe that was the trick
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 so Oh well I guess we bought a lot of 
 we've been buying turkey lately instead of beef 
 so 
 even though you know 
 the ground turkey it's the meat is softer 
 and I 
 everybody seems to like it 
 So Sometimes it seems to be cheaper too 
 so we often buy it
 we buy it
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 so we bought that 
 or we bought the the filets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets 
 and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference unless you tell them
 Or in 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Less cho- less cholesterol Yeah 
 right 
 right 
 Well I guess that's probably all we need to do for tonight
 I always like dessert 
 Right 
 right
 that's always good
 Probably probably the only family recipe that we we make and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake 
 and we take a recipe from my grandmother you know
 it's probably fairly typical cream cheese and egg and sugar and the insides of a
