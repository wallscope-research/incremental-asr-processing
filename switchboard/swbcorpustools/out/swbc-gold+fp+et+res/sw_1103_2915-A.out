 Well I think we pay too much in taxes
 How about you
 Excuse me
 Yeah 
 that's what I think too 
 I don't know how you feel um 
 we moved here from another state 
 We lived here before went out and came back 
 and that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax
 And what you find out is there's one evil is the same as the other 
 Here you don't there's no occupational tax 
 but it's a heavy sales tax
 So they get you coming and going
 Yeah 
 it's really I know it's just um 
 Yeah 
 it is 
 I was shocked 
 I went 
 we bought a new washer 
 and the man said and that's eight percent 
 I said eight percent What 
 So it's really kind of sad 
 yeah 
 And then I don't know how you know in terms of when you all do your federal 
 but it just seems like if you're strictly middle income it seems like you get hit the worst
 Is that what you think
 Doesn't seem quite fair does it
 Because they have the money to shelter things 
 and I don't know somehow get a huh <> 
 Oh I thought you were going to say something
 They somehow seem to get around these 
 the things that we can't you know 
 that make don't make that kind of money 
 I don't know
 Uh-huh
 I know 
 and just somehow it doesn't seem you know 
 and then I you 
 mean you look at like uh that country singer uh what's his name Willie Nelson
 I was reading about him in the paper and I said Well you know he knew he was making money 
 *[[slash error; two utts]] Some he didn't look that stupid 
 Why didn't he pay his taxes You know
 *[[listen]] In a way it's almost like he had so much debt that uh filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know 
 So Do you file federal or joint income tax 
 [ or do you + *[[slash error]] And do you ] feel like you get hit by you know too much
 Uh-huh 
 And we right now we don't own any property 
 We lease 
 So we're in the same 
 we don't have children 
 so we're in the same kind of 
 it's not as bad as being single and divorced 
 but it's sort of like if you have like X point five children and earn you know you kind of get hit with you know 
 I I mean it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage because 
 doesn't that sound stupid
 But I mean there's actually less tax implication if I don't work full time compared to what my husband does you know
 *[[are the final "you knows" tags]] So it's kind of hard
 Excuse me
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah
 otherwise you're just you know 
 and if you have kids you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or something 
 Oh it is
 Oh my
 Well that's not too bad
 Uh-huh
 Oh my goodness
 <> Yeah 
 I guess that's my call 
 I guess I better go 
 Okay 
 well it was nice talking to you
 Uh-huh 
 bye-bye
