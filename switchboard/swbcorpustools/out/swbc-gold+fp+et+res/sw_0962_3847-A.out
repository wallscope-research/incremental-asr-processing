 I pushed it
 So what do you you in your lawn 
 Do you do it yourself 
 or do you hire someone to do it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 right
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well we do our own out here uh you know mow it ourselves and everything 
 but uh our water supply right now is bad 
 We need rain badly 
 Uh we can water here in Patterson I can water on Tuesdays Thursdays Saturday and Sunday four days a week
 So 
 It was this last summer 
 yeah
 Uh now if it we don't get some rain they might limit it to not even four times you know
 but uh yeah 
 we do our law- our you know mowing ourselves and everything 
 and I do our planting of bulbs and things where I can have some spring flowers
 and uh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 We have quite a few roses 
 I just uh we in fact we just pruned them way down 
 and I just had to replace one of them 
 so I just bought that yesterday 
 and I'll probably go outside today and plant that
 But um I like to have the roses where I can have cut flowers all year long
 I even had uh roses on my table for Christmas dinner which was really pretty you know 
 But um other than the roses I don't have too many flowers 
 I plant gladiolas
 and those are always pretty 
 but they get so tall 
 and they they bend over so fast you know
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh 
 well is it that one of those Amaryllis
 No 
 huh
 Oh okay
 Uh-huh

 Do you have a big yard
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 right 
 right 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well that makes it nice
 Well it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool 
 but we don't have one you know 
 but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know
 but we just we just have dogs and um and grass you know the cement work and a little play set we made for a garden 
 So we do have a garden you know
 It's just a small one you know 
 but we had lots of tomatoes and uh zucchini
 it's amazing what you can get out of a little 
 you know it's probably about twenty by I don't know twenty by six something like that 
 and it's amazing what you can you know how many plants you can plant in there
 but it was nice 
 Few cucumbers
 Uh-huh
