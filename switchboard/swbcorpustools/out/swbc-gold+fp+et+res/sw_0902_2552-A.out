 Well Brent I've been um I kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because I thought uh if it it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school
 And I thought it was a good sacrifice to make because um it was important to me to to spend some time with kids 
 I know that when I was in school and getting my degree at the same time my husband was it was really hard on our family because I would he would come home 
 and I would leave
 and then when I would come home 
 and he would leave 
 and um so I think one day one of our kids said you know 
 someone came home 
 and they said well when is dad leaving or something 
 It was like that they thought that's the way life was that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time 
 And so I think um it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family 
 So there's one or two nights a week we have a 
 on Monday nights we set aside time where it's called uh family home evening 
 and we stay home that evening all of us 
 and we do things together
 Yes
 Oh you are
 Yes 
 and 
 So you do that 
 and right and then we try to do a family activity on Saturday usually in the morning
 Right 
 and then you know sometimes we try to do our lesson on Sunday night and then our activity or something on Monday 
 but We're it's real important to us to spend time together
 I have two
 Uh-huh
 I have a girl and a boy 
 and the boy's five 
 he's in kindergarten 
 and the girl is four 
 She'll be in kindergarten next year
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh Uh-huh
 They are a handful
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well no 
 and it's it's just not um it's not as stable for the kids
 and they everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now 
 But uh it's yeah 
 Well it's also important I think um for my husband 
 I I try to go out of my way to to plan things that he can do with the kids because since I am home with them and so I get a lot of time with them he needs to have um some time with them 
 So he when he comes home he um you know it's his job at night He puts the kids to bed
 and he reads to them
 and he spends about an hour doing that 
 and that's that's pretty good quality time with them 
 and um but it's hard for him on Saturdays 
 He he wants Right he wants to run out and get things done 
 and so um I try to say well why don't you go fly kites 
 or why don't you do something 
 And if I have something in mind then he he remembers that that's what he wants to do
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Well that's right 
 But I do think um you know like the current trends are that um the family unit is devaluated 
 It's not nearly as important 
 We find that you know back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems the first place they went to was their family
 And families took care of themselves 
 and um but now you know people don't they don't support each other that way
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 and 
 Right 
 right
 And it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make because you know I you know I have interests that too 
 and it is hard to make uh those interests not be as a major part of my life
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 It is temporary 
 It in the middle of it it seems like a long time
 but you're right 
 it is temporary 
 Well I see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids 
 and and in spite of 
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 That's true
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well it is the hardest thing I've ever done as much as you'd go out 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's good
 Uh-huh
 No
 Yeah 
 I think so 
 I think it's an investment in your future even if it's purely not not religious 
 You can at least say that it's important to our country that our family unit stays strong
 Yes
