 Well uh yeah 
 I I'm employed by a company that does do uh random drug testing 
 and I've got some very definite uh opinions about it Uh you know which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from from when they when they announced it But uh developed a little more I guess but haven't changed that much 
 What about you 
 Are you uh in- involved at all
 Yes
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 It uh that's that's mine 
 It it you know 
 I I go back 
 it to me no matter how much the th- our company claims it's not a constitutional issue That because this is uh between a company and an employee it is not it is not a government 
 it's not 
 the Constitution doesn't apply 
 But I it it seems to me that it still should 
 I I our company's doing it because they're a uh government contractor 
 Uh and so it's it's required for certain + some form some form of drug program is required ] to get the government contracts 
 and I'd I'd *[[slash error]] Yes 
 Okay 
 An- and our company has taken that and gone all the way 
 Say 
 okay uh 
 first off we don't we don't have enough courage to uh pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage uh because that would offend them uh if they if they weren't 
 So we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even 
 Uh and and uh 
 then uh 
 but and they 
 so it's a a complete random testing 
 w- well it's random in the sense that you don't know when 
 It is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested
 Uh and uh you know I I sit at a terminal and and write software all day 
 It it uh certainly has no life threatening uh capabilities uh you know in in my job 
 And and uh yes 
 I I agree that there are there are uh jobs that are definitely life threatening 
 and and and th- there needs to be a line drawn somewhere at rea- reasonable and proper 
 I- you know 
 Well 
 Yeah 
 I that that I that I will give credit to to our our company for in that that I think there's there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of of uh of drugs 
 And e- e- essentially the first thing is t- is on the order of paper in the urine and uh or some you know 
 it's not quite that simple 
 but it's fairly simple
 Coarse kind of test 
 And then there's a a much more uh uh refined test uh uh spectrography or whatever it's called The chemo- chemotography uh to determine exactly what the what the things are 
 And uh 
 No 
 I I've been with this company for uh for sixteen years now
 And uh 
 No 
 And it and it and it has it has you know 
 they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody 
 And I uh at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't you don't know 
 But on the other hand uh someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test
