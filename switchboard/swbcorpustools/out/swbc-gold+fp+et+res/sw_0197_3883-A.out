 So how do you just figure 
 Wow

 Well um I'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I was working at now 
 Um when I was a teacher um in Utah I would generally wear um dresses and heels and things like that
 and even when it um rained and snowed I just braved it 
 and I wore heels anyway 
 And 
 I know 
 it might kill you to go up and walk up to the door 
 but you're going to look nice for the kids 
 Oh oh yeah 
 Well I need all the height I can get 
 Oh yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 we too Um 
 if it was real- it looked really dangerous then I would wear boots 
 but then I would change um into heels as soon as I got to my desk 
 So um 
 Oh
 Oh
 Sure

 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Huh Well um 
 Yeah um

 not

 but I never wore jeans because um I thought that was too casual 
 For
