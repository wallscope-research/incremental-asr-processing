 There we go
 Yes and no 
 Income tax no 
 I uh I look at it this way uh you've got to pay for the privilege of living here
 But uh being a uh a rec vehicle owner 
 well in fact I live in a motor home 
 I'm a ful- what they call a full timer 
 and uh it burns gas like crazy 
 I only get seven miles to the gallon 
 I really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes 
 and they call it uh uh 
 what's the word they use 
 anyway a a luxury tax
 They ga- add it on on to tires and gasoline cigarettes liquor 
 It doesn't bother me any because I've quit drinking 
 and I quit smoking 
 So that doesn't bother me 
 but I don't think it's fair
 It's too um um it's attacking just certain people
 Even with the gasoline tax
 No 
 Uh fifty years ago the automobile was a luxury 
 but it's a necessity today 
 and uh as hard as they try to get these public transit things going I have never seen nor heard of one that really got of the ground Or that accomplish what they set out to com- to accomplish 
 What are your feelings on it
 Yeah 
 That that's that's so true 
 I mean they say well you voice your opinion uh uh uh on election day
 No 
 you don't 
 Look what happened on the last presidential election 
 read my lips
 And what happened they turned around and double crossed us
 So uh I mean you can't believe what you hear
 Oh
 Uh yes
 I agree 
 and and uh I I also think we extend too much help to other uh countries 
 we need enough help here in this country
 They're still people starving people here 
 *[[They're> There're]] why should we help starving people somewhere else
 Absolutely 
 Now I can't wait for uh 
 I I could just picture wha- what's going to happen here in the not to distant future 
 We keep hearing well we're going to receive uh eight billion dollars from Japan for the uh uh-huh the the the big war over there in the Mideast
 And uh so many billions of dollars here and there and everything 
 and uh the next thing you know we'll be turning around just like we did to Poland 
 and say well just forget it
 Oh definitely
 Well another thing now they keep decontrolling different things 
 First it was the airlines then it was banks and and uh um savings association and whatnot
 Exactly 
 And the same with the airlines back in the days when they were uh controlled and and uh Transcontinental or um um Interstate uh Trucking 
 I mean as soon as the federal government gave up control on all that they just went to hell in a hand basket
 Prices went sky high 
 Then in in the case of airlines of course they became highly competitive 
 and they cut each others throats until they're they reach the point where they're cutting their own throat 
 And uh well of course that's getting away from taxes isn't it 
 th- that's government controlled 
 But uh 
 Oh by the time you get through with the uh the penalties
 Uh I agree 
 I think the I R S is uh just too powerful 
 There should be some sort of a control on it 
 And they should be a little more humane
 Uh the uh typical bureaucratic I guess That's that's one of my pet peeves 
 I came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the the budget
 Very simple 
 Give uh uh uh government employees the average number of uh holidays as the uh private industry
 I mean you think about it now 
 they they get about sixteen holidays a year
 It sure is 
 And I think here at TI we get what is it nine or ten
 Well I remember uh uh 
 thinking I think it was the last time I did hear that we get about the average 
 Maybe even a little more a day or so more than the average
 But uh government is ridiculous
 Just think of the money they could save 
 I mean they're they're paying out this money anyway
 Why not get the work out of the people
 And well anyway that would of course eventually come back to taxes 
 But uh as far as income tax is concerned I can't complain too much about it 
 Uh I'm single 
 I have no uh dependents or anything 
 my children are all grown 
 and they're out worrying about their own income taxes
 Uh very true 
 That's 
 And then they tell you to uh well invest it in uh is it I R As or something 
 and and when you turn When you turn sixty-five why then you pay the tax on it 
 and the tax is a lot less
 But in the mean time you've got your money tide up in a low relatively low interest bearing investment 
 I mean it's not making ten fifteen percent like a business is today
 Uh me I'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it
 Well you well do you do you need some help spending yours
 Oh uh-huh 
 Well that's my problem too 
 I'm I'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that's going to get paid
 Uh-huh
 Uh let me ask you something 
 Did you get a catalog or something from these people
 You did
 I've everybody I've talked to has received one 
 but I haven't gotten mine
 Um well anyway Ellen it was nice talking to you
 And uh until next time
 Bye-bye
