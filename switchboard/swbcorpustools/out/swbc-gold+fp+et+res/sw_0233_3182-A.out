 Do you have any hobbies
 What are yours
 Ooh how great
 Oh uh ceramic painting
 The china more
 How did you ever get into that 
 That sounds so interesting
 How marvel- 
 I 
 Now do you do it just for yourself 
 or do you do it to give as gifts 
 or do you actually sell it
 Oh that sounds mar- 
 now do you work outside of the home
 You've just retired
 Oh oh what a great hobby 
 I 
 Don't retire
 Well see I don't 
 I never uh returned to work for the p- 
 I have stayed home for about the last nine years
 We've transferred around 
 and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake uh on Lake Erie 
 So the lake life appealed to me 
 and my husband's working 
 and he left it up to me if I worked or not
 So in my spare time I love to sew 
 There aren't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing 
 but I do make all my own clothes 
 and we recently purchased a new home 
 so I enjoy doing my uh toppers for my window applications and things like that 
 But uh just when I thought I really enjoyed my hobby yours sounds great 
 That is excellent
 We're in the sub- I'm in the suburb of Cleveland 
 and I'm about uh fifteen miles probably from downtown Cleveland something like that 
 And Cleveland is located right on Lake Erie 
 and prior to this we were fifty miles west from here 
 So we were right on the lake 
 And Cleveland isn't all as bad as what you've heard 
 And you do find people uh into the crafts and the things that uh various things for spare time 
 but I have never heard and I have actually never run into anyone into the china painting 
 and I'm just intrigued with it
 Right 
 where you're getting into the delicate work
 Now do you where did you first get your lessons from
 Through a uh an adult ed or strictly a china type
 Oh how marvelous
 Oh and it's so nice
 It must be so nice for you now that you're retired
 Oh isn't that great 
 And you'll probably really uh re- regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a a class again
