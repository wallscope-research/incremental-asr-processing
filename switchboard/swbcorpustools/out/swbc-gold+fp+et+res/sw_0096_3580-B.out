 Yeah 
 I I agree
 it's definitely new frontier stuff
 I I I worked on some of it at T I once upon a time 
 Yeah
 Well actually I'm I I'm quite versed lately 
 I get on a computer network all the time 
 and people are talking about about the current space program all the time 
 They're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that you know are just like science fiction you know 
 it's like they take off you know 
 and then they land with the with the you know 
 the afterburners are going you know not like space shuttle landing you know gliding down but straight down to the landing pad
 Yeah 
 it's called V C X or something like that 
 Also called Delta Clipper which is a decent name for something like that
 Oh yeah
 I think I would 
 I think that'd be neat
 Well you know I had a car uh uh a tire come off of a car 
 so you know I like I know what it's like to 
 Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home 
 Yeah 
 they're talking about doing that again too
 Uh-huh

 Yeah 
 and they're going to put 
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah

 it's it's it's something definitely that uh you know 
 it's it's uh got the extra little oomph of interest
 Uh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I wish uh 
 like uh Boeing or McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy uh a space shuttle sooner or later and just make it you know purely commercial
 and they'd go up you know and do things 
 and 
 Oh
 No 
 it's still probably going 
 but I don't know whether it it research will go on
 Oh yeah
 Well they're they're going to be cutting back so much on just you know the number of troops we've got in Europe and the number of troops we have here
 But uh Russia's still going to have missiles 
 they're still going to be subs and things
 Yeah
 Latest I heard it was just going to be Russia that Russia itself that was going to have them
 At least that was you know that's what everybody says 
 Oh yeah 
 yeah 
 we want only Russia to have them
 And now they're saying Yeah 
 yeah 
 you're a republic 
 you don't want those 
 you don't want those 
 Uh-huh
 One hopes
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
