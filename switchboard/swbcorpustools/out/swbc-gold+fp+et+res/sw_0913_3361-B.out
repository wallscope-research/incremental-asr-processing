 Well 
 Uh I'll tell you 
 I I watched what went on um with the TWENTY TWENTY show I don't know if you saw that a few days ago that that talked about nursing homes 
 and actually they specifically talked about some in the area where I am here in Texas 
 and 
 Pardon
 Well I 
 no 
 I'm not familiar with those homes per se
 but um they were in the area where I live uh 
 and it was really revealing to see some of the you know the things that go on I guess in some of these homes 
 so I would definitely you know want to really check things out and uh go 
 I guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that to to make sure that you went daily you know and made sure that they were cared for 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Well actually I have that kind of situation because my mother lives with me 
 and she's eighty-seven
 and uh from the time that we were tiny she said you know I want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home
 So I know how she feels about it 
 You know if I uh if I ever had to put her there I think uh it would be probably when I just could not handle it any more you know if I she got to the point where she was totally bedridden and and I mean I just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed 
 I think that would be the 
 Uh I wouldn't say any more than usual
 I think it's very hard for her um to be waited upon so to speak 
 I mean I think it's hard for her to have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to
 Yeah 
 I think that's very true
 Um on the other hand it takes on almost a a switch of a mother child relationship
 Uh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's as you say lived on a farm for sixty years 
 and then go to something like that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Yeah
