 Recently I can't really say recently 
 But I think about uh about a year ago uh I bought a product from some company down at uh in Atlanta Georgia 
 I believe it was one of these uh one of these uh mixers These like these juice machines 
 and uh the uh the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked you know perfectly okay 
 but I found that uh it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh after 
 even despite you know diligent washing it it got rusty after about uh three weeks of use 
 And I don't think it was my fault because i- I you know I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it 
 but uh it was really uh it was 
 I had to send it back after like you know the third week because I realized it was like it was not 
 something was very very wrong with the blade 
 Uh what about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 *[[slash error]] Well at least your talking to somebody who counts 
 *[[slash error and your should be you're]] Uh-huh 
 Right
 Right 
 right 
 I find 
 up here in the northeast we have uh well w- we have these mail order companies like L L Bean 
 and uh they are famous for I guess having really top-notch service 
 They've got uh 
 I mean I've I've I I have friends and family who order from them because you can you can literally I've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half 
 and even after like eighteen months of you know reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition 
 and they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore 
 Uh they'll they'll actually do things like this 
 I mean they're really they they go- bend over backwards service wise for you 
 I've uh I've found also a lot of companies nowadays have they have eight hundred numbers you can call 
 I guess if if you call the e- any eight hundred number uh if you you can call up e- any eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get uh the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies 
 And um actually I've tried that with a few companies lately 
 And they've most of them have been pretty good 
 but I I was 
 one reason why I like I buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that uh if you buy through Bean or though 
 uh I guess Bean's one of Bean's big competitors is Land's End out in uh I guess it's Wisconsin somewhere 
 They they are uh they're very good about uh insur- 
 like the customer is always right 
 and you know no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding 
 and uh they usually get you know they they make things are they ma- make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise
 Uh-huh
 *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] Well I think I guess nowadays with the uh with the economy the way it is I guess 
 there was a there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are uh you know 
 things are getting rough out there 
 there's a lot of you know 
 the morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn like you know
