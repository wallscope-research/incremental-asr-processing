 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I do work
 Uh and 
 but I work at a manufacturing plant 
 so I wear a lot of blue jeans and T-shirts
 But occasionally I have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress and high heel shoes 
 and I feel really uncomfortable doing that 
 and in the plant so uh it's it's a problem for me
 But normally I just wear blue jeans and a T-shirt
 Very very comfortable 
 I like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right 
 Well I have plenty of suits and dress clothes because I'm like you when I first started working uh I have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match and that kind of stuff 
 but now that I you know work in the manufacturing plant then it's just it's so much more difficult for me to to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that
 Uh but occasionally I have to because uh part of my job is teaching and training 
 and uh so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal garb 
 Than your normal garb 
 But I'm like you too uh I moved from Ohio down to here
 and I had mostly polyesters and wools and winter clothes and buying all these cotton clothes 
 and then of course you have to iron them all the time
 That's really 
 that's been a problem for me
 Right 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 That's true that's true
 Well I know I was just now uh uh putting away a lot of my winter clothes
 and I was going through here 
 and I was thinking I haven't worn this in three years
 And because it's a wool skirt 
 and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it
 And I have five or six wool skirts
 so I was thinking well maybe you know I need to think about getting rid of them 
 but no I folded it up neatly and put it away maybe next year 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 I know I agree with you 
 *[[ 2 slash units ]] Well I know last year uh well this past winter it wasn't that cold
 But the previous winter we had more uh cold weather where I was able to actually wear your double and triple layerings of uh clothes yeah like you would when you're up north 
 So that's really interesting
 Yes 
 yes 
 yes 
 and they're all one hundred percent cotton 
 and 
 Yes 
 yes 
 I know 
 So I uh I have my ironing board sitting out all the time *[[ Looks like this should be the end of a slash unit not continue in B's next turn ]] I never put mine away 
 *[[ See note above ]] It is it is
 That's true 
 and and I've been looking at these uh uh like in Home Depot where you can go and they've got that ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the uh uh what the the the door
 And uh 
 and then you can ha- actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall you know to have it permanently attached 
 and that's what I'm thinking I'm going to have to do because mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom 
 and it's just it's just an eyesore I think with all the 
 Uh-uh 
 uh-uh
 No 
 I've been thinking about putting the ironing board in the closet and and running you know a line in there for my iron so I could do it in there 
 and I wouldn't have to have that eyesore 
 Yeah
 So I have a big closet
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 I no longer do that weekly thing because I have so many 
 and I'm like you I the night before or that day I will iron whatever it is that we need 
 and that's it
 Because it's too many 
 hundred percent cotton
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Right 
 Oh I know I know
 No 
 no 
 of course not 
 No 
 that uh that would be too simple
 Absolutely not 
 That's right
 Uh-huh 
 absolutely absolutely
 Oh
 That's right 
 That's right you do you do 
 *[[ More than 1 slash unit ]] So uh 
 but yeah 
 I uh I know several of my girlfriends though we uh we all keep our ironing boards out and just uh an ever present thing in our household 
 so 
 There you go
 Things that need to be mended things that have to get ironed
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 That's true
 Oh well it was nice talking with you
 Okay 
 take care 
 Uh-huh 
 bye-bye
