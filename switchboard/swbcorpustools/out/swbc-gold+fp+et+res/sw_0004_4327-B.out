 Ou- ou- our judicial system is in such total chaos
 I think what they need to do is they need to somehow take the money out of it 
 I mean when you have a man that's signed a a a statement saying he's guilty 
 we have a a family called All day family 
 They were all murdered
 All the people signed confessions 
 they went to a trial by jury 
 They been trying these people now for twenty-two years ever since I was a child
 And what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done 
 has nothing to do with justice whatsoever 
 Uh that's true 
 I I I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself
 I I hold it in the utmost contempt
 The uh d- my favorite is the police department 
 they're not aimed at the criminal 
 The judicial system is aimed at the citizens 
 because you and I we have work schedules 
 we can be called at work 
 we have Social Security numbers 
 they can trace us down 
 we have telephones 
 then we have checkbooks 
 Criminals have none of these things 
 They're real difficult to catch 
 and if they do catch them they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas us we write a check
 So where do you think they target their efforts
 They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals
 You know that's a 
 I've nailed the problem down 
 but I 
 Yeah 
 I'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about 
 I think to begin with you would h- you would have 
 like here in Atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical 
 yet you go out on the streets 
 and they're giving speeding tickets
 I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from 
 Now I firmly believe in that 
 because when you get the most heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney
 And here's this bum that didn't have a job
 and he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford
 Who's paying for that
 Yeah 
 and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it 
 Yeah 
 well that's another problem 
 I think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it 
 I mean they're they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever 
 and with that type person running it I mean you you could expect that you
