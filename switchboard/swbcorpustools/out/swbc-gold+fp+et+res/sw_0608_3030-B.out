 Uh-huh
 Great
 Oh that's nice
 Right 
 right
 No
 How often do you meet
 Oh yes 
 yes
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh 
 Well that's much more reasonable 
 I was involved in a a club like that for um that you know where we tried to really do gourmet uh meals
 And uh we we were a little bit too frequent I think
 I don't remember if we were once a month 
 or anyway it was it was difficult 
 By the time we went around it was uh four couples 
 so uh by the time we got around uh to each of us and it was time again we were almost tired you know Um partly because um wh- gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining 
 It's too rich
 And so i- we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day
 Um so uh we we kind of 
 and then one of the couples uh moved 
 and so we sort of didn't didn't continue it 
 but um and I must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time then you you don't have as much time for uh regular entertaining 
 but um uh uh when when we entertain I usually try to find something that will be um kind of h- good for everybody 
 and that's that sometimes means you can't do gourmet because depending on who your guests are
 Oh yeah 
 well one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all
 Uh so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese
 Uh well I take that back 
 Uh she can't eat some cream cheese 
 But that that really limits
 um
 Oh yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh wow
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Sounds wonderful
 Oh sure I do too
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Sure 
 Well my um daughter is graduating uh Sunday 
 and so we're having a uh few people in Sunday afternoon 
 And I did a cop out on to it 
 I'm buying cold cuts 
 Well I have to make a cake 
 and I have to make hors d'oeuvres 
 and I have to make dessert 
 so I figured for the main thing it's going to be sandwiches
 Uh so oh I'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on 
 But I can't do it you know working full-time 
 and it's just too much
 Those people that try to do everything
 Yeah 
 Ugh 
 Wouldn't that be nice 
 Yeah 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh they do 
 I- it's very difficult to purchase um items that are as good as what you can make yourself
 Um in spite of uh 
 or if you if you do buy it it's extremely expensive 
 In fact uh I just got back from a shopping trip to purch- purchase the cold cuts 
 and I I bought turkey and pastrami and and barbecued ham at a an Amish market near here
 And I've never been there before And found that there's uh individual vendors 
 and the foods are wonderful 
 And one of the uh the um vendors had cakes All sorts of wonderful cakes Uh they fresh str- strawberry cheesecake now and and so on
 And it's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake Um which is really not such a bad price 
 I decided I I just couldn't quite make myself um buy it because I do make cheesecake 
 and somehow I didn't want to do that because it 
 but I was very tempted because it looked wonderful 
 and the- they had black forest cherry cake and all those things
 That ar- but those are homemade 
 They are not um commercial bakery made 
 And in that they are made in their homes um 
 so it it's kind of interesting uh 
 it's out there if you want to pay the price 
 but 
 Right
 just smelling the air 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 We like hot food too 
 so 
 Right 
 You don't sound like you're from Texas originally though
 I thought I thought that there was a slight difference in accent
 Right
 I'll bet
 Did um do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy 
 or is it always complicat-
