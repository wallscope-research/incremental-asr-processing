 So have you done any painting projects lately
 Oh really
 What kind of painting was it
 Uh-huh 
 it was it 
 Yeah
 Oh uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh well what kind of paint did you use for the um bookends
 Uh-huh
 So you can't use oil on wood
 Oh so you had to go around with paint all over you temporarily anyway 
 Oh 
 Oh is is that what you usually use in the house is latex
 Um
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I heard about that 
 I guess a friend of mine had a uh well 
 she she just started up a day care center 
 and uh the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff
 so uh she had that done 
 But uh 
 Well um so to speak I had to paint this uh the inside of this warehouse thing *[[ I would have put a slash after the answer "so to speak" ]] that you keep some um farm equipment in
 and um what I had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer 
 and uh I had this big five gallon jug 
 and it was like paint thinner 
 I mean I you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner
 but uh you just took a roller and put it on there 
 and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed 
 So 
 Yeah 
 it was 
 it used all of it 
 I guess it was about three hundred yards worth 
 So Well I guess it worked out 
 It was pretty easy actually
 Well what about the trim in your house 
 Did you have to do that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 Did you have uh one coat or two
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that would be really time uh a time saver
 Uh-huh
 Oh me I would have had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges
 and and then I'd have probably rolled it on 
 I'd it would have taken me forever
 Yeah 
 well the first time it'd probably would have taken me forever 
 so 
 Well how long did it take you all
 Uh-huh
 So there was two of you all
 Well that's easy enough
 Um
 I think I could probably do it uh as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then I could do it
 Uh-huh
