 Well have you ever served on a jury
 Well I was called 
 and then I was not chosen
 Oh really
 Well uh could you give me an example of a case where you think that
 Well I mean I think 
 are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more uh tangible 
 or 
 Well do you think that that in a civil case if there was majority rule that it would be easy for someone to be set up
 No 
 I'm not
 Well I mean I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served
 Say 
 but uh 
 and I also think just like you were talking about before why you were chosen to be on a jury that uh the just the process of picking jurors is not always objective
