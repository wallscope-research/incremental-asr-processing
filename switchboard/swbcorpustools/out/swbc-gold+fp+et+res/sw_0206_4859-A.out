 Okay 
 Uh generally I get uh you know most of my news uh in the you know weekly magazines like TIME NEWSWEEK and and uh U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT With with occasional smatterings of of uh you know THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and of course the local paper
 But uh my my only complaint is I really don't enough time to to look at the articles every day and and go through a paper you know exhaust the details 
 So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines
 Well yes 
 I I well I I don't think I have the time to really become a student in every article
 And and so I I I like the weekly magazines uh because i- it gives me you know the high points of what's going on
 Uh but many times uh you know the the local uh the local news kind of suffers you know 
 But here I am you know cheek by jowl with our nation's capital 
 and 
 Yeah 
 Yes 
 E- exactly 
 Well when when the capital gang always talk about the people inside the beltway I'm saying to myself hey guys I'm inside the beltway 
 But uh i- it turns out that uh that that the C N N is I think is great And for for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events 
 but generally they're they're they're more sound bitish you know kind of thing 
 and and I don't really uh you know I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient uh you know dose of news that way
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Well the MERCURY and the and the and the CHRONICLE are the only things that are really can stand up there
 Uh Redwood City 
 I use to work at Anteks 
 Anteks Amdahl and places like that
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I I've I enjoy 
 see they have uh we have two the both C SPANS here 
 But but really the th- on the public T V you know MACNEIL LEHRER is one is an hour's program that I always 
 if if I watch any news program it will be MACNEIL LEHRER And and occasionally C SPAN 
 I I like a I saw the uh the uh the the tapes that were that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust 
 was the whole thing was was run on that 
 and and and a- also they have the uh the uh uh PARLIAMENT'S QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD 
 It 
 when wh- when it first uh you know when it first tuned in on that I you know 
 it's one that's 
 I think it was somebody was just scarcely just just ripping the hell out of someo- another person 
 And I 
 and everybody was you know making noise in the background 
 And then *[[needs slash mark]] Yeah 
 Here's this dude in a wig 
 and I said to myself it's another Monty Python that I didn't know about 
 And then and then up jumps Margaret Thatcher off her green bench 
 and I said oh it's Parliament 
 Yeah 
 So I I thought to myself I can't wait 
 I'm going over to to Britain in mid you know in mid-May 
 I I I'm going to uh you know a- you know apr- approach my uh you know 
 this is how I discovered you know the que- the Prime Minister's you know question and answer period you know 
 P-
