 Right
 Yeah
 Where where do you usually go
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 We are uh we have not had a vacation in several years 
 so be our first chance in awhile uh 
 we are going to go to uh Destin Florida which is a very nice beach area if you are not familiar with it
 Oh it's it's gorgeous 
 Uh we used to go quite a bit uh before I moved out here 
 We were closer and uh used to go almost every summer uh and rent a condo there on the beach 
 Uh there's quite a few uh there's a lot of development of of condominiums there on the beach front
 And uh so they have uh they are very very large condos 
 And they have quite a few rooms and uh so we we will usually rent one for about a week or so 
 And 
 go down
 Oh
 Yes 
 it's uh it's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water and a lot of nice waves usually uh
 enough enough to make it 
 I am sorry
 Uh there's not as many sea shells along there uh 
 that's the only thing that they really do not 
 they have some but not not so much
 Um if you go further down uh you will usually find some but not right in there 
 Uh I do not know why it is 
 but uh it just 
 it seems not it seems not to have as many there right there 
 But uh we we enjoy it uh 
 it's 
 the place where we stay is we usually stay at the same place every year 
 and they are like I say right on the beach 
 So 
 It's a place called Jetty East uh J E T T Y E A S T 
 and it's uh called that because it's at the very end of uh a jetty there which is uh sort of at the end of this little little point 
 and uh it's a at the very end 
 it's the last set of condominiums there 
 and it's uh it's very nice Uh 
 it's not very expensive uh 
 you can 
 I think we are going to go with another couple and their kids 
 And uh they have a we have a uh I think it's three bedroom or two bedroom uh condominium which will sleep I do not know quite a few about six or eight And uh cause it's got you know pull out couches and all that 
 and uh I think it's going to cost us per couple about three hundred dollars for the week
 Yeah 
 it really is 
 because uh the uh you know it has got its own kitchen full size kitchen and everything 
 And this one I think has two baths 
 and it's 
 the one we got is on the on the beach side 
 So 
 We have got a beautiful view and balcony 
 and uh just 
 you know it's really a nice stay Uh 
 in fact we stayed there on our honeymoon 
 we I had won a trip to the Bahamas but did not get to take it on our honeymoon time 
 so we instead went there uh and loved it just as much as as if we had gone to the Bahamas 
 We in fact we stayed an extra day or so because we liked 
 the uh the particular ro- uh uh uh suite we had gotten was very nice 
 and so we decided to stay
 But uh it's a pretty nice place 
 you will need to try to go and stay there sometime
 It's a little far from here 
 but uh 
 Yeah 
 we are 
 We are 
 it will take uh a day and a half to get there probably
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Uh what does what does that mean alternate
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 I see
 Kind of scattering the vacation out throughout the year
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Okay
 Okay
 So long
 Bye-bye
