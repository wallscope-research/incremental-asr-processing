 Right 
 I I I actually I live in the city
 and uh I guess it is a concern of mine uh you know for my own safety
 Well that's right 
 Uh *[[slash error]] Uh I think it is bad in certain areas 
 *[[sv]] however I think the area that I live in it's not uh the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city
 I think it seems that there's certain areas where uh the crime is focused uh
 Well I think it's what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility 
 and uh they've had some impact but not a tremendous amount 
 and probably um they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing I think 
 Yeah
 You know particularly in some of the housing projects uh you know that's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused
 and they've got to do more than just having having cops there 
 They've got to kind of change the way people think about it
 Um well I've been to 
 I'd say it's it's probably in the top top ten in terms of crime 
 Um it's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example 
 Probably not not as bad as Detroit
 No
 Yeah 
 that seems to be true 
 Um yeah 
 if you've ever been to like New York City 
 and you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed
 It's that obvious
 Yeah 
 that's true
 With a big stick 
 or
 Right
 Sure
 Right 
 don't don't walk down a an alley 
 or don't get 
 just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation
 but yeah 
 there are times when you can't avoid all that
 and and then you're kind of on your own 
 Uh no 
 The only thing I've ever had was I've had my wallet lifted
 but that was in a more of a a setting where there was a number of people around 
 and I kind of got 
 I was much younger at the time
 and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off so I didn't know who had it
 I've had that happen 
 but that's that's about it
 Oh yeah 
 Um
 Really 
 well I've had my 
 Uh-huh 
 I've had my car stolen 
 so maybe that counts
 Yeah
 Oh no 
 that was in the northern p- um up near Cumberland Mall area
 It's actually Cobb County 
 but it is Atlanta
 and uh there's a lot of car thefts in that area
 Right
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 mine was just it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage 
 but they didn't they didn't strip it
 so I got it back
 Yeah 
 than most
 Right
 It was about three grand to put everything together 
 They cracked the steering column of course to steal the car
 Yeah 
 you got to you crack the steering column 
 and you pull the 
 there's a pin in there that you can pull on these G M cars
 and you can start it up basically pretty easily
 Well after I found mine I had to I had this
