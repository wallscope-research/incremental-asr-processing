 Well actually I don't think they're out of line 
 De- Devil's advocate possibly 
 but it you are trying to avoid paying taxes 
 and whe- whether or not you agree with that law i- you're still circumventing it 
 You are legal in in your circumvention of that law
 Really I I I don't think that's a valid argument 
 I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax 
 Um s- s- naturally some some things you just can't find in your local K-Mart or or uh Bryn Mawr stereo dealer 
 Uh but th- th- th- then why not pay pay the sales tax 
 Corporations have to 
 why should an individual just because it's just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax
 Yes 
 I I'll agree it it's not your responsibility 
 but b- is it also legal for you to do that 
 W- w- fr- from what I understand from v- v- various net readings i- i- it the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes uh in into place in the next few years 
 It is it is a lost revenue stream right now 
 and states c- can use all the revenue they can get 
 With some with something like that d- do your arguments still apply
 Which is exactly what businesses do at the present
 And I I I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having having to pay sales tax on it
 That's my understanding of the way uh the way it works 
 Usually the the person ordering doesn't pay 
 But the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay 
 And there r- there are s- some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that
 I- 
 No 
 Businesses uh if purchasing things mail order 
 if if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see these this great deal on forty-six mother boards uh from from say Utah 
 Um I I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax 
 My a- accounting department will at the end of the month 
 I think that i- i- I think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania 
 And I know they work that way in uh say here in D C
 Yeah
 That's true 
 I- i- a r- a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh I I forgot that 
 There there is no well defined mechanism at all 
 and and that it is a a l- loss I I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism ju- just to do just that in or- in order to gain the revenue that's being lost 
 Uh I mean I I don't know if I agree with that 
 But it but
