 All right 
 Last thing I saw was um I think uh SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY with Julia Roberts
 My husband didn't like it that much 
 I thought it was okay 
 It was a little strange you know 
 this woman supposedly is um being mentally abused by her husband you know 
 he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house 
 and she figures out this way to um to leave him secretly 
 You know she fakes her death kind of thing 
 and he tracks her down 
 So the the end scenes are are kind of suspenseful you know when she realizes he's in the house you know after her 
 but uh kind of had the feeling along that uh 
 why didn't she just tell him to straighten up
 You know why didn't she just tell hi- 
 Hey look bucko 
 you don't get away with this nonsense /
 But anyhow um what have you seen
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 So this is where the people have been kind of <> W- 
 I don't a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma for a long time 
 And the drugs let them come back
 Oh 
 Um
 Well how bad were the side effects
 Oh
 Oh 
 Um
 Um
 Um
 Well how about KINDERGARTEN COP
 You know Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be uh a bit of a variety actor you know 
 At first he was just a big muscle man
 But he's kind of branching out
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Well there was a movie out 
 it's been on cable 
 I get cable 
 and there's this thing with uh Danny De Vito called TWINS/
 I thought that was just great
 I even like some I mean some of the original stuff 
 like I like THE TERMINATOR 
 At first you know it was kind of strange
 but I still like watching him in THE TERMINATOR And and some of the other things 
 Um TOTAL RECALL last year I thought was really good last summer
 Guess it didn't last too long at the box office
 but I thought it was pretty good
 And 
 Um
 Um
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and I I have some 
 one person at work I know gets really into those goofy horror flicks
 and I just keep telling her how can you do that 
 And I told her when she had her her little girl 
 I said now you better get out of the habit of watching those 
 You shouldn't be watching them with your little girl
 and she says her little girl's into it now
 And she wat- she watches these really gross things you know like THE NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and The you know that kind of junk
 I don't go for that at all
 I remember when I was real little I we all went to some kind of scary movie 
 and it was like this ho- big house had a basement 
 and there was all these weird things going on in the basement you know 
 and I was scared to death of our house had a basement for years/
 You know 
 and I got a lot of really weird ideas from that goofy movie
 You know they tell you that kids can you know be impressed by all that stuff 
 and it's true
 I I had a lot of things that I I 
 nobody told me that it was all fake 
 I was just sitting there watching it going <> Oh jeez 
 But I think a lot of kids it's funny get the same kind of fears like there's somebody under the bed
 Where do we get that from
 Um How old are they
 Oh 
 but I remember I was with a friend of mine had uh three kids 
 and the little boy must have been oh maybe about ten 
 And we rented CHARLOTTE'S WEB 
 Okay
 And he just bawled at the end and just <> uh she's not going to die
 And we were trying to say Kenny it's okay 
 and he didn't want to listen to it
 He just was beside himself you know 
 this is supposed to be a nice children's movie CHARLOTTE'S WEB 
 He just couldn't stand it that Charlotte was going to die at the end/
 Oh yeah 
 <> She's so nice 
 she can't die 
 Oh it was jus- 
 Oh
 You too
 Yeah
 this is kind of neat 
 I haven't ever initiated a call 
 I've just been called you know by the switchboard 
 and uh well the first week I think a lot more people were doing it 
 But I normally get a call like every other day
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Um How weird 
 I don't know 
 and they they do have a variety of topics 
 My first one was the toughest
 it was something like discuss pollution
 It was discuss air pollution causes of it and cures 
 I was going oh well 
 Uh-huh
 Say well I know it takes a fishing pole and some bait and some water 
 All right 
 Bye-bye
