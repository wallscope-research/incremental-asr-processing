 Uh-huh 
 I have a home
 Not really 
 we have a small backyard and small front yard
 but uh uh I do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding 
 and he mows the lawn because the lawn mower is too heavy 
 That's another story
 And uh and uh I do the edging and stuff like that 
 but uh it doesn't take us that long because our our yard is so small
 But uh I try and do as much you know flowering as I can and that kind of stuff The seasonal things
 But uh I think we have one of the nicest yards in the in the neighborhood 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 That's true
 I don't 
 No 
 he does that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh Oh God
 Yeah 
 Don't blame you <>
 Yeah
 Huh okay 
 we don't have that many bushes to put them on 
 Uh our our yard is very uh narrow
 and so we have some bushes but we don't have too many 
 but we have a nice tree in the front 
 and uh we have people that an association that comes and mows everybody's front yard
 and uh they keep hitting it the tree with the lawn mower
 You know every time you do that it uh kind of kills the tree for a while
 And so that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again
 And we started mowing our own lawn
 because they were doing that 
 And so anyways I have a nice full tree now 
 and and we put we fill it with lights and that kind of thing
 So 
 And they would uh they also edged 
 when they would edge in into the shrubbery and oh gosh it was getting really bad 
 so we 
 Yeah 
 because it's an association fee
 Yes
 it's like seventy a month
 Yeah 
 and I don't like 
 I I just get really upset every time I make that check out
 But uh 
 They take care of the uh landscape 
 because we live in a cul-de-sac 
 and there is a island in the middle
 so they care of that 
 and there is a pool and they take care of the pool
 and and there is a pond 
 they take care of the pond in the park area and that kind of thing
 And uh so you're basically paying oh 
 and the sprinkler system that 
 that 
 our yard doesn't have a sprinkler system but the island does 
 and uh certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems 
 and and so that way if someone moves out the entire neighborhood is mowed and watered and that kind of thing you know
 So 
 Well it it it went up what we pay
 And that's the bad thing 
 I just hope it doesn't go up any more 
 because we just can't afford it anymore 
 I don't know what to do if you can't afford it 
 So uh but they're 
 that's what they do 
 They take care of basically the front yards and unless you don't want them to do it
 They 
 o- only in like in the common areas and in the island
 But they don't do it in your yard
 Right 
 uh-huh 
 yeah 
 so we've added bushes and and shrubbery too
 I know
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's what we did when we first moved in too
 Just rearranged some things 
 Oh
 Oh really
 Oh
 Oh yeah
 Oh
 That's true 
 so gosh 
 you did it manually
 Oh
 Oh gosh
 I bet
 Yeah 
 that's a good investment there
 Oh
 Oh
