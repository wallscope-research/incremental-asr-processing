 Well you know you know last night I was listening to the uh ten o'clock news
 And for the first five to seven minutes of a news broadcast all they were talking about was the number of shootings the number of drug deals that were going on and crime 
 and and it's so depressing just to even listen to the news anymore
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I did too 
 I remember us- I used to work at uh Kentucky Fried Chicken
 And and I just couldn't believe um you know that 
 now I would hate to work at a fast food restaurant or even have my children work in one
 And uh because of uh the crime 
 that they would um kill people just for the few couple hundred dollars that they would have in there uh in their cash drawer 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Oh I understand what your talking about 
 So yeah 
 I have uh uh you know a real problem uh 
 even though I live further out in the suburbs the crime follows you anywhere
 it it doesn't matter if you live in a small town or if you live in a small town or if you live in a large city like this
 Um so but I just think about the all the different ways that we have to protect ourselves from 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 So I don't know um you know 
 it's asking about what kind of steps we can take um uh you know just as citizens to try and um uh protect ourselves 
 I know I have uh um home security system
 Plus I have the uh the special lights on on the outside 
 And I have 
 Yeah 
 that uh 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 By themselves 
 if you if there's some kind of movement then they'll automatically come on Um 
 but I mean it's just I'm constantly think about keeping us safe and protected verses um 
 Two 
 Two
 One of each
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 No 
 no 
 there teenagers now
 Yeah 
 Oh wow
 Yeah
 That's a problem 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It's different 
 yeah
 living down here 
 Now now the nice thing uh 
 I feel a little bit more comfort since we're so close together like this Um 
 I I feel like that there's going to be uh less crime 
 or your neighbors going to be watching out for you um because it's it's practically it's in their backyard too
 Oh goodness
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh my goodness
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh goodness
 Someone did
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I know that it's a real problem 
 It doesn't matter where you are anymore
 It's uh more of a matter of what you the steps that you do to keep yourself safe 
 and um so that's that's why I try and uh do 
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh
 Really
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 You know I was going home the other day 
 and I saw um a guy who who looked like he was breaking into a window
 and I thought gee whiz you know I don't know if he's really doing that or not or if he's th- he's the person who lives there Uh 
 you know and and I was thinking well I need to call the police when I get back home 
 and because it was about oh about four or five blocks from where we live 
 and uh and I thought no you know because I wouldn't know if that was really a robber or not because it was in broad daylight 
 But anymore you know the crime happens in daylight as it does in in night
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Half that time
 wow 
 I mean that's so scary
 So scary you you think you've got yourself all locked in and safe 
 and and uh somebody could break in uh 
 oh I have a dog
 that's the one thing that I like
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 So that's ano- uh 
 we have a little dog now 
 but he is just as vicious as is you know if you bu- 
 And loud 
 yeah 
 and I thought that uh you know we'd have to have a big dog 
 but we doesn't need a big dog 
 We got this little bitty dog that uh 
 part Dachshunds and part Cocker Spaniel
 And he um ease very protective
 yeah 
 Very protective
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Yeah

 Right
 Oh wow gosh 
 Well it was nice talking to you
 Okay 
 Okay
