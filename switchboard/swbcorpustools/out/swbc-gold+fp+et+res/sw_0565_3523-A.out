 We're set
 What changes do you feel have happened
 Right
 Increases each year doesn't it
 It increases each year I think
 Well and I think women have kind of had uh in the past the real subservient role
 And uh 
 Well we do to some degree
 but uh uh I think it's not as much as it was
 I And especially I think with women increasingly working they're going to have to demand more from men
 Because there is just i- impossible to keep up on everything else
 Have more of an active role in taking care of children more of an active role in taking care of the home
 Right
 Well you know there is a lot of companies that won't give mat- women maternity leave for that very reason
 Uh in fact I know the school districts down here you they don't have maternity leave 
 Uh you simply have to take accumulate your sick leave And take your sick leave
 And I don't know uh if bigger company companies do 
 but when I was employed with the school district I didn't have maternity leave either 
 and that was the reason 
 because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men 
 but So uh 
 Yeah 
 it is
 You have to save all of your uh vacation time
 You do 
 You have to save all your vacation time 
 and that's usually how it's uh happened 
 but uh 
 What do you see uh changing in the future
 Right 
 and and top level 
 Maybe top level
 That would be kind of nice 
 That's right 
 that's right 
 Yeah
 I think that's probably good 
 A little more integration
 And uh maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners 
 and 
 I think 
 Right
 Right
 No 
 I don't either 
 I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal 
 We just function differently 
 And uh I'm not capable of lifting what uh a man can lift and you know that type of that type of thing 
 but uh one of the big changes uh they're doing in Salt Lake is uh 
 and they're probably 
 I'm sure in Dallas since you're big places a lot more women are uh working right out of their home with their P C's or with their lap computers or whatever
 I think that 
 Right
 Right 
 You only have to check in with the office once or twice a week 
 and 
 Course they're talking about uh that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that 
 so uh it would be kind of exciting in some ways to to see a little bit more of that 
 and some ways it might be kind of scary
 Think anybody could do it 
 but Anyway 
 Right
 Right 
 but then you know there is the process of selection 
 Would you have to give them the brand 
 and uh *[[slash error]] You know when you shop you usually compare the prices 
 and would be nice though
