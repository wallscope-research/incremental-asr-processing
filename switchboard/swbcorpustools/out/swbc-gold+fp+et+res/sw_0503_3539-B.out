 Okay
 There is 
 well I am a school teacher
 And us 
 there is uh uh girl that went through our school district I teach in Highland Park who uh does aerobics at the Y C A and I say Y the Y W C A 
 <> turn that off please 
 I am recording <> 
 My husband just turned on something noisy
 Any way uh she comes to the school 
 and there are a group of teachers 
 and we exercise regularly and uh for an hour 
 and we do it twice a week
 And uh we do uh aerobics for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes 
 and then we do stretching and toning and cool down for another thirty minutes 
 So it is an hour 
 And then my husband and I take uh ten mile walks uh as often as possible
 And uh not on the nights that I do aerobics 
 but if if he wants to he jogs 
 but I uh I we take the fast walks 
 and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house
 And so we we take it seriously 
 We enjoy doing it
 I enjoy my group at school 
 It is a lot more fun to exercise with somebody than is is to do it by yourself
 Oh oh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh I understand that
 I have never been able to do it before
 Well I and too I just make myself 
 I get up at five thirty 
 and I am at school at seven thirty
 School is not over until uh four
 and our class 
 but it is in the building
 that is the big difference 
 because there are other people around that uh 
 you had better hurry 
 Go get dressed 
 You know there is motivation around there 
 and then uh we we can change right there in the building 
 I don't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere
 And I just go 
 and we uh exercise 
 And until then you know I have belonged to exercise clubs 
 and oh I have gone to uh oh like uh oh these gyms you know that the like in Plano and Richardson and uh where they offer the uh rec centers really where they offer aerobics 
 and I have done that before but it has always had to be late at night after I have got home and after dinner 
 and you are just kind of going Ugh
 And I have tried it immediately after school 
 like try to get some place and exercise from five to six 
 but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late
 It is 
 It is really hard with our life style when you work to
 Uh-huh
 I have twenty-five minutes for lunch
 That is out for me
 No 
 I don't think so
 But uh and they are nice because if we are running late it usually uh 
 if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late they kind of wait on us 
 You know cause they know we are in the building and coming Where as at uh another place you are paying a lot more money 
 and uh it does going to start whether you are there or not 
 So this has worked out real nicely 
 In fact she charges us two dollars a session
 Huh-uh 
 So it's it's 
 we like pay her for six weeks at a time cause that is like a unit in uh uh school uh report card period 
 and so it is like twenty-four dollars every six weeks
 Huh-uh
 You are not kidding 
 I know 
 We belonged uh for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year
 I mean we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership
 and at first we used it 
 and then it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth
 And they offered lots of things 
 but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to
 So we decided to forget that
 That was just a waste of our our money
 Oh no
 Uh-huh
 It does make you feel better 
 The hard thing is getting going
 And if you have somebody who will do it with you 
 like for a long time my husband didn't want to walk cause he wants to uh jog
 but he decided that uh maybe uh you know
