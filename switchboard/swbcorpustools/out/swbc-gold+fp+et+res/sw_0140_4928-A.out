 Well my exercise program consists of uh you know 
 it's it's a opportunity to stay alive really Instead of you know wasting my my the you know the trying to exist on the latency of my youth the good health of my youth 
 I'm 
 and what I like to do is I like to stretch out 
 and I like to run uh m- 
 I'm I like to run get my heartbeat up 
 I like to run about oh about two two and a half miles 
 And then I like to work out on uh on the uh the Bailey Life C- Cycle machines up here at the at the Holiday Spa 
 And and I I think that you know 
 I've had a regiment now for about you know ten fifteen years of of doing that 
 and uh and I I kind of think it's uh it's a lot of work
 but I think it's uh it's a lot of work 
 but I think it's uh it's the uh the amount of effort that's required to uh to stay healthy you know 
 I have a sedentary job 
 and uh unless you do something like that y- you're going to get sick
 Well I uh two years ago I started having trouble with my knee 
 And uh you know I've got you know 
 I figured well it'll go away 
 Well I s- you know I'm I've had to reduce my program reduce my program 
 and I've gained fifteen pounds
 And so uh you know it's e- you know 
 I need to get back into swimming you know instead of running 
 If I can't swim or I can't run I should be able to swim 
 Well I'm such a terrible swimmer 
 and I I I really feel I can I can dedicate about an hour an hour and fifteen minutes f- to this effort 
 But if it gets longer than that I I i- it I start not doing anything
 And so so I got a real problem in that regard 
 Uh it 
 do 
 you obviously are are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it
 Well it's it's always a chore 
 I mean I started doing this when I was about thirty-five
 and now I'm fifty-five
 And uh you know I I know that in I just know that I'm going to get blown away with some some piece of nonsense 
 Y- you know some health related thing is going to blow me away 
 That's the same way 
 I got too much weight on right now 
 I need to lose fifty pounds you know 
 I need to lose at least twenty you know 
 But uh you know it's it's just uh I'm busy 
 I'm doing a lot of traveling 
 and uh it it creates a problem uh you know when you're on the road
 What sort of uh uh what other programs other than say running 
 Have you have you ever done anything at all
 Uh-huh
 club what club are you with
 What club were you with
 Oh Okay 
 So you're you're down you're downtown 
 Okay 
 Yeah 
 You're down there on you know twentieth and eighteenth and F G 
 Oh 
 Well I'd uh 
 well there's a there's a Holiday Spa down there on on K street I think Something like that 
 But uh I I go to the Holiday Spa here in Alexandria 
 and that's pretty good 
 But you know evening time it gets pretty busy 
 But generally you know I can I can get in and get a program you know
 But uh you know I I need to I need to rededicate myself to uh to doing this 
 and uh I got a problem uh you know ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it 
 I mean I've been doing this for fifteen twenty years
 And you know and I'm I know I'm going to get I know it's going to bite me in the ass 
 and so I I really don't want to want to uh you know back off on it
 Well no 
 When you're young you you can abuse your your all your systems 
 and you can recover
 Uh when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away And just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye you know 
 And uh and so the object
