 Yes 
 I have four cats
 Well they range from let's see about a year and a half to nine years old
 Yes
 Oh okay 
 you get so attached to them
 Oh
 Oh no
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 uh-huh
 Yes 
 I understand
 Oh no 
 I understand 
 we uh we've gone through the same things with ours 
 we've had you know they've been ill 
 I mean I take off work to take care of my cats you know 
 my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy
 And then we had a baby 
 and its like all right who comes first the cat or the baby
 And and then when we go to sleep at night you know it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us
 It's like all right whose corners is this one
 Oh uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh
 Oh no
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 that's it 
 Right 
 traumatized for life here
 Oh yeah 
 we've 
 all four of ours are house cats
 We started out with two with two outdoor cats 
 but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them
 Oh well he lived through it 
 oh I couldn't believe it 
 We went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills
 The the cat almost died 
 and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat 
 oh he loves life now
 And he's like oh thank you so much
 I know 
 we wondered about that 
 But uh oh that was a traumatic experience for us too
 Uh well uh from what we can tell it was a pellet gun 
 and then he started chasing him with a bull whip
 Oh yes 
 absolutely nuts 
 But uh luckily enough you know we found the cat in time and uh rushed him to the vet 
 and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery 
 and tod- 
 I mean he started off as a stray 
 and then we did all this for him 
 But oh he's been a wonderful cat
 Oh yes 
 But uh we wouldn't ha- we wouldn't have them 
 I mean I don't see us without pets without cats
 There's just uh there's this they just fill this void
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Oh no
 Right 
 and you worry about oh who's taking care of them
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 well I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night 
 We we- I had one that had we had we had to put to sleep he got so sick
 And uh well I fell in love with this uh it's a Chinchilla Persian and uh brought him home 
 and oh my husband just died
 It was like we can't take it back 
 you've got we've got to keep it now
 Uh-huh

 Oh we just uh just love them
 They uh you know get to feeling so lovey and dovey 
 and they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest 
 and it's like oh your claws need trimming
 Oh yes 
 yes
 Oh it just drives us nuts
 Um yeah
 They really are 
 The cats are so independent 
 and they have so much more personality than a dog
 And but oh they're so much fun to watch them play
 Yes
 Oh we've got 
 well the two that were outside they're like brothers 
 I mean I've never seen two cats so close
 And uh they uh will get to playing chase through the house
 and it is hysterical I mean 
 and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit 
 It's like this train
 I mean it sounds like a train 
 We have wooden floors 
 and so it just sort of echoes through the house 
 Oh no

 And she's so ugly
 Yes

 She's she's the oldest one and but uh very possessive
 I mean it's like nobody messes with her mamma
 And uh I mean it comes bedtime
 and she's right there

 It will be
 Oh goodness 
 You get so attached to them
 My mother has dogs 
 and I'm like no
 This is nothing like cats
 Right 
 I'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person no it wouldn't have worked
 Oh that's one of the requirements I asked him 
 I said now you do like cats right 
 We don't li-
