 Okay
 Well I I think it's a pretty good idea 
 I think they should either do that or or afford some time to the military or or helping elderly people
 I I you know I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help 
 and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home 
 and I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea 
 and or the military for a year or two wouldn't be bad for 
 I think it teaches kids how to grow 
 How about yourself
 Yeah 
 I've I've 
 that's really great 
 I I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent two excellent organizations
 You know kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that
 and they don't follow it at all you know 
 There are very few Scouts go on and become Eagle Scouts 
 And and I don't know what the high rank is for the gals 
 but 
 Oh 
 Senior 
 okay 
 So there's not uh 
 Yeah 
 they they lose interest
 and then when they young young adults there's even less interest there 
 They're more for I g- 
 Not not 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 you're absolutely right 
 I think it's a really a good thing 
 I I like to see 
 of course there's you know third world countries that can use all kind of help 
 But I think we ought to start right here at home 
 I'm you know 
 No 
 it it 
 I think that yeah I think that we need to really address what we've done here 
 and and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook
 Well it's been really good 
 We talked about this for a few minutes 
 and uh hopefully we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday 
 but I I don't really have too much more to say on this topic I guess
 It we I guess we both agree that it's a good thing that they should do sometime
 Well you take care 
 and and enjoy the day
 Thank you ma'am 
 Bye-bye
