 Okay 
 um now we're supposed to talk about social activities 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 I think um well I guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation 
 I think your generation is um 
 what do I say uh 
 uh they're + they're they're polite 
 they have more respect for other people just in in general I think and just just towards people and property 
 and um I I guess they would would be more conservative some of them I guess
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes I agree with 
 Uh-huh
 Well Well do you think that that maybe 
 I mean uh I've heard different you know like um like 
 I know my mom and like other ladies they complain because they think that um the women now are too busy with their own personal life and career that they really don't have time for their kids
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh my gosh just a baby
 Oh my gosh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well um um well I think the education like our education has um increased dramatically 
 but then I think also that we're forgetting like basic things like we should know
 like I I think well um in the morals and values of like my generation for the most for most people are totally different from the morals and valleys um values of like per se your generation 
 But I think as we get older it gets to your you know what I mean 
 I think the kids now are are I would say louder now until after they reach like twenty-five 
 and then I think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 because I think we're given more now whereas you had to work for everything 
 and kids nowadays are just given so much that they really don't have to work 
 and you know and they they don't have any intent to go working until they have to
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I don't know because I know I don't watch while I'm up here at school I don't watch hardly any T V 
 Like Thursday night I like to sit down and watch a few shows 
 but I 
 No 
 I don't watch that 
 I used to 
 but I don't any more
 But all 
 I mean there are even though there's a few up here we call them couch potatoes 
 they love to sit in front of the T V 
 I 
 but for the most part I will I will 
 well I live in an all girls dorm 
 but for the most part we're all between the ages of eighteen and like twenty-one
 and there isn't really a lot of T V watching
 They're either hitting the books or something else 
 I don't know what 
 but I know oh well I guess they have their crowds like during the soap operas you know like in between classes or something
 but I can't say that there's really that many people that like sit in front of the T V all day
 Uh-huh 
 but then um like I know this girl 
 She's doing her student teaching 
 or she's just working like within the school 
 and um yesterday she was at the kindergarten 
 and there's this little boy 
 he like didn't want to do anything 
 and he said I'm not doing this 
 I don't like it 
 and he sat at his desk with two pencils in his hand and pretend like he's playing Nintendo you know 
 so uh I don't know how 
 I mean I never really watched that a lot of T V when I was younger 
 but my parents really didn't allow us to watch that much T V 
 so I don't know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well we watch a lot of I guess we watched a lot of T V in the Winter time 
 but in the Summer like right now my mom well like she doesn't let us watch T V until like eight o'clock at night you know
 Well like my younger brothers and sisters at home 
 Like when it starts getting nice outside in the Summer and everything she'll she makes us go outside 
 even now when I go home for the Summer she makes us go outside 
 and we're allowed to come in and watch T V until it's dark because she doesn't like the T V herself
 and if it was up to her we wouldn't have one 
 So you know she feels that kids are too dependent on it also
 Um
 What about in our work ethics
 I 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Yeah
 Well I really can't think of anything else
 It was nice talking to you too
