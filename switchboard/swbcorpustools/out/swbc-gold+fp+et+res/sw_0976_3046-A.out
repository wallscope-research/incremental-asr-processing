 Good morning
 My name is Jean
 Oh where you from Tina
 Oh Garland Texas 
 I'm in Pennsylvania
 Really 
 Do you work for Texas Instruments
 Uh-huh
 Most of them do 
 Now I don't have anybody that works for T I 
 but uh my son works for a computer company the National Institute of s- s- something 
 I don't know what 
 So I guess we're supposed to talk about foods today
 Yes 
 uh-huh
 You ready
 Okay 
 Uh foods like you would for a dinner party or something like that
 Well I don't know 
 my brother lives down East of us down there 
 and I don't think they ate all that much different 
 Uh I think as long as you plan your basic foods 
 course for a dinner party you fancy things up a little bit more
 Uh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 and it's not as good as if it's fresh
 Uh-huh
 Is that right
 Yeah
 well they probably were trying to do the best they could
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well they do in the summertime 
 I think that tea is big in the summertime mostly
 Of course you have warmer weather most of the time
 So uh 
 Yeah 
 So I 
 Is that right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 More like covered dishes for those type of dinners
 Well I don't know 
 just about anything 
 Yeah 
 we we really uh use most anything 
 I uh I think like parties and that though are 
 well like we had a dinner party here here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party 
 But basically we tried you know included all the basic uh foods that you are supposed to have in a meal 
 Your uh bread family and your 
 or least what it used to be the regular menu was followed and ham and bake potatoes uh
 uh something from each each area that you're supposed to choose from
 And uh we we we ourselves are into the wok cooking 
 you know they been advertising that 
 and we've really been enjoying those uh meals
 They have a lot of vegetable to them 
 and uh they really are very good
 Is he a meat and potato person
 Well all our family is is gone 
 They are out on their own
 And uh It it's much different 
 and uh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well my husband didn't like that 
 so we us kids 
 we had five children 
 and we ate that when he he wasn't going to be home for supper
 that's what we had 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh yeah
 Oh those always go good
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh really
 Well maybe that's good the way way the things are going
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers and that 
 and it is easier to chew
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 We don't really have uh you know entertain too much
 I don't know if you do or not 
 but we we don't a whole lot 
 we're more once in a while but mostly family activities
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well that's good
 Yeah 
 we do a lot of that take things to church 
 and our homemakers meet at the church also 
 and uh that's what we do mostly most of the time for that
 So you don't really include any certain food groups 
 you just bring what you like 
 Sometimes you have all desserts 
 sometimes you have all vegetables 
 Yeah
 But it doesn't happen very often 
 usually you get a pretty wide variety 
 and you can you can have pretty good meals from one of those
 Oh those are fun
 Uh-huh
 Uh uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh 
 Oh
 Was there enough to go around 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's kind of irresponsible and does upset you because they are grown adults usually 
 and you know they know better
 Even if they can't do it they can always maybe get somebody else to cook 
 Right 
 Right
 They said that we could share we share a recipe 
 but I'm up at my daughter's 
 I don't even have any of my recipes with me
 Uh you know 
 Oh
 Oh great
 They are ready to go
 Well we probably have we talked long enough 
 I 
 Okay 
 so I'll let 
 Oh same here 
 You have a good day
 Uh-huh
 Bye-bye
