 I did for years 
 I don't have enough family left to have them
 But 
 Well I come from a family that was very large in Bell County
 and and my grandfather came to Bell County on a covered wagon and had ten children 
 and so sometimes we would have a reunion with that group
 And then sometimes we would go to Arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group you know
 Yeah 
 it was a lot of fun
 Uh-huh
 Um now we would have group like that in Arkansas
 We'd have two hundred and fifty or three hundred
 Well so many of us came from a long way that we we'd usually at a motel 
 and we bought food there
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well it's something I really miss because I had twenty-seven first cousins
 and you know we were very close family 
 but our father's generation was enough older than I 
 my father would be a hundred now that they're all dead 
 and in fact many of my first cousins are dead
 and of course they have their own families and grandchildren and all that 
 so we really very rarely all of us get together
 and and we're a long way away 
 and and the younger generation the next like my cousin's children I don't know very well you know
 But it 
 so it's 
 I doubt that that will come to be again 
 but as long as my oldest aunt lived we we got together once a year
 Well and and folks have gotten so mobile 
 I mean like I have a son and a daughter and two nephews that are grown and a brother who has a new marriage and a younger son 
 but my brother and his wife live in Nevada my daughter lives in Colorado one of my nephews lives in New York City one nephew lives in Memphis and my son lives here 
 but I think it's very unlikely we'll have a family reunion you know
 Yeah 
 and I'm divorced 
 and really only immediate family I have left is my my 
 I have a son and a daughter
 But my family's really all dead
 But it was great pleasure while we did it you know 
 Uh-huh
 Does it bother you if your children are not interested in it
 Does it bother you if your children are not interested in it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well what kinds of things do you do to try to get your children interested 
 Just talk to them about it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
