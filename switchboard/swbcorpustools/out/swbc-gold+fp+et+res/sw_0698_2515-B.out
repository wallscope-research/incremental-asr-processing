 All right
 No 
 we probably should 
 but we haven't 
 So why don't you explain to me some good tips about what you've done which you've found useful and workable
 Uh-huh
 Um okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Hm
 Uh-huh
 What do you do for the surprise things that you don't necessarily plan for 
 the you know are sometimes several hundred dollars like uh tires for the car or car repair of some sort or like a a dental bill or something that you're not prepared for
 Oh
 Do you kind of continue call this like a part of savings account or a different savings account 
 or 
 Oh
 Oh okay
 Hm
 Okay 
 then so like your pay what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that you know will cover all of the expenses kind of thing
 Or like what what percent do you then save or something
 Hm okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Okay
 Checking account a lot uh not so much credit cards 
 Now several years back I used to use ch- uh charge cards and you know all the time kind of thinking oh well it's on sale you know it must be a good deal There have been times that I have been bad about the credit cards 
 and so pretty much now uh we don't use them too much 
 If we travel or something yeah But you know Standard we usually don't 
 Or if it it is a purchase uh then it's paid off when the bill comes 
 You know so it isn't any extended uh 
 it may be that I picked up something at the store 
 but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then 
 so it's not any you know uh build up on the charge cards at all
 And but that hasn't always been the case 
 So I'm kind of 
 I feel at least better now that I have finally gotten some of those things uh you know in the past 
 and I don't have you know big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards because that interest rate just is a killer
 Yeah 
 well I've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow 
 But uh pretty much when I always I go to the grocery store or something I just always write checks
 Hm
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh we are in the process of trying to buy a house 
 do you know how did your budget work 
 or did you have a budget to uh get your down payment going to get a house
 Huh
 Oh okay
 Okay uh 
 yeah 
 I just keep thinking all the time 
 I mean it it's really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your you know your priority at least mine is to save for the house 
 But then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment 
 You feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime
 Uh-huh
 Well I know 
 but there are times when I sit there and I think wow you know we make X amount of money and where is it 
 I mean you look around 
 and you go where is it 
 you you haven't made uh big purchases 
 and that's the easier thing to see 
 if you can see a big purchase and you go okay well this is the year that we bought the couch or the T V or something like that 
 But all those just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door 
 and there's big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries and stuff 
 That you don't have tangible I mean the perishable kind of things that's gone used and gone 
 Oh
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
