 Okay 
 All right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I work for the University of New Hampshire 
 and uh our benefits package isn't uh isn't quite as good in some ways Uh you know 
 overall I'm satisfied with it 
 We don't have the vision care 
 we do have the health care and the uh and the medi- or the dental 
 Uh
 No 
 I work in I'm a on the professional administrative and technical staff 
 and I effectively I run the telephone switch at uh at the University of New Hampshire
 Uh so the uh the benefits 
 uh probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the uh the uh very generous vacation time and sick time
 We get fifteen days a year sick time 
 and uh we get twenty-four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty-four days a year uh time off
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I think uh the the health care of course is an important and has to be the single most important benefit
 and uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh you know 
 I'm I'm a little disturbed about that 
 but I think that's a national trend 
 and I don't know that uh I don't know what the solution is to it 
 It's bigger than just the benefits part
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh yeah
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending 
 and and the cost between them is very is very little 
 I think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan
 But it pays uh a substantial amount 
 I mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free
 and uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses
 Uh yes 
 it is 
 The benefits plan is different for operating for what we call operating staff which are considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which I belong to
 but the main 
 I think the the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan 
 But the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued
 Uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's you know based on how long they've worked there 
 That determines how much uh vacation time they get
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 College programs belong to this T I A A uh C R E F retirement fund
 Right 
 and in the case of the University of New Hampshire uh
