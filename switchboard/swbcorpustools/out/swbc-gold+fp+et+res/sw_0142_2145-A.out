 You want to start
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I agree uh 
 the equality of uh the roles now between the sexes I guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war especially compared with uh the Vietnam war 
 and you see women going off to wars as well as men
 Uh I have wondered why they allowed or let you know both the father and mother go uh 
 and the children are left without either parent 
 Now to me that's kind of a drawback 
 But uh I guess it's a price you pay 
 And I also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the uh uh day care centers
 Well uh from what I understand there's been studies that uh these children are uh more rebellious 
 Uh they term it as more uh creative But uh that they uh are much more contentious 
 So I I don't I I guess we'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up you know in a uh kind of a uh community rather than a home
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 So they 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 What do you mean
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 That's strange
 A nanny sort of
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 That's right 
 that's right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 To come in and live with them
 To come in and live with them
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 And then you might have more control over uh the the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center
 I know the day care centers are not cheap either 
 You know they're 
 Uh well no
 I just know I know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it 
 They have to go with the a single uh wh- I mean a baby-sitter more more or less
 But I think it's like about sixty dollars a week for two children if I'm not mistaken 
 And you have to pay that whether you're on vacation you know and taking care of the children or if the children are at home at home sick 
 I mean that is you know just a a rate that you have to pay 
 and uh 
 Uh <> I think I really don't have a vision 
 Yeah 
 I I I think that they will be more in the work place because uh the door's open
 And uh it's just human nature to walk through an open door 
 So and I would be glad to see that 
 I hope I don't see a lot more single moms 
 but i- it seems in my experience I'm running across single women all the time
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 It's awful
 Yeah <>
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well I think we've done it 
 Thank you very much
 It's been interesting
 Okay
 Bye
