 Yeah 
 oh definitely 
 Seems like 
 Yeah 
 I think that uh we probably will have to have have to uh have a state income tax because uh Texans don't approve of such things as lotteries uh well I I come here from New York 
 and New York had a state lottery
 and it really raised a lot of money for the for the state
 Uh although we 
 in New York we had to pay a state and a city uh tax 
 And it was really a great relief when I got to Texas that I didn't have to pay that city income tax though
 Right
 It sure does ma- make a difference
 Uh-huh 
 Do you live in Dallas
 Oh you do
 Oh I do too
 Okay 
 and then you know too that um taxes are are less like if you live in Mesquite
 You know some people will go shopping in Mesquite at the malls out there uh
 Uh-huh
 Eight point five
 Uh-huh
 Is it the s- 
 is it uh less in Collin County than it is in Dallas County
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it sure did 
 and then once you could deduct at least some of that um off off your income tax
 and you can't do that anymore
 It really hit me yesterday I had uh air conditioning service for my car done 
 And I had a little little uh coupon special that was twenty-two dollars for um air conditioning service where they uh checked it and ch- recharged it and put one one pound of freon in 
 and if you needed another pound of freon they ga- 
 it it was like seven dollars and something 
 And then with the with the twenty-two dollars and the seven something it all came out to I I ended up paying like thirty-four dollars
 And I couldn't believe it and the tax you know really hits you *[[ both kinds of slash error; Should be 2 slash units I think ]] Uh-huh 
 And then *[[ slash error]] Oh it's been I've been here for nine years
 *[[slash error]] Really where did you come from
 Oh uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well uh I did visit uh Michigan I visited Kalamazoo once 
 My sister used to live there
 Uh-huh
 That's true I tell you what hit me the first year I was here uh Christmas eve in New York there used to be stores open the department stores wouldn't close uh *[[ There seem to be several slash units in this turn that were not parsed that way ]] well I'd say they closed maybe eight or nine o'clock department stores on Christmas eve
 But uh there were stores that you could go to uh you know like discount stores and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to/
 and you could shop until like twelve or one o'clock that night 
 and that was like that was really the only night they were open that late 
 but it was Christmas eve
 And when I came to Dallas I thought I was going to do that Christmas eve 
 and I couldn't find hardly anything open after five o'clock in the afternoon
 An I was oh I was I really I really was stuck 
 And I think Target was the one that stayed open later than any anybody else 
 And uh I was able to pick up a few things in there 
 but boy I was I was really shocked
 And then another shock I had well when I went to um to buy a slice of pizza and found out that I had to buy the whole pie
 Yeah 
 now 
 but they 
 back then they didn't
 When I first came no 
 Anyway 
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and talk a talking about alcohol and beer look at the taxes on that and the taxes on a package of of cigarettes 
 I used to smoke you know
 and uh that would have been enough to to make me me give them up 
 The price of them now 
 but I gave them up a couple years ago because I had some sinus problems
 Well 
 Well they're like two 
 or I I believe they're hitting two dollars a pack now
 A little bit a little bit more in some places
 Uh well I believe it's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton *[[ slash error ]] I think it's maybe thirteen or something
 Um because I remember we went to to Oklahoma to th- this bingo place This Choctaw Bingo uh a couple weeks ago 
 and somebody that went with me bought a carton for uh ten dollars and something 
 and they really thought they were getting a big discount
 Well because it's you know the Indians I don't think they pay tax
 In in Oklahoma
 And uh it was a Indian well it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the Indians there
 Although I didn't see very many Indian people in there 
 There were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's it's the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth
 I won a dollar 
 Yeah 
 I had fun uh a couple on the bus won some money 
 One one guy won t-
