 Uh pretty good actually 
 I work for Hewlett Packard 
 and they have uh a pretty good uh benefits package 
 In fact they're they're kind of known uh for having good benefits 
 The pay isn't fabulous 
 although I saw a survey recently 
 and I'm actually making just about as much as you know I'm m- making actually over average over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me
 I've got a Bachelor's in electrical engineering 
 so 
 And I'm not like a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff
 Uh anyway the our benefits are pretty good 
 We've got stock purchase program and a 
 that that's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is kind of a a pain 
 but uh there's a four O one K plan uh for uh sheltering some taxable income
 Uh there's 
 I've been with them for seven years
 Yeah
 And the best thing and a lot of the stuff the best thing is like four years or five years it's pretty soon you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything 
 so uh it's not t- 
 but there's full uh th- there's several medical plans to choose from uh that cover pretty much everything 
 I don't get sick that often 
 so I don't pay much of it 
 b- and I pay five dollars every time I visit the the hospital that you know for a checkup or whatever
 Uh they don't cover eyes though 
 and I I have contact lenses 
 so that's kind of a pain
 But you know I I can live 
 Oh yeah 
 yeah
 Right
 And 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and and the dental plan is fabulous 
 The dental plan I pay absolutely nothing because uh 
 I I guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that
 but that's not the case 
 so I guess nothing 
 It's fabulous 
 Uh the 
 what about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 one of the things with my company is that they've uh got a reputation for a lot of job security 
 and uh there's a lot of different things that they do lot of different divisions even this area in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do 
 so there's 
 I myself have moved around quite a bit within the company
 and it's and I and I haven't had to move my residence to do that 
 You know I still live in San Jose 
 and 
 Yeah 
 it 
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 In fact I know a guy who works at Andover who used to work who I used to work with out here
 and he moved his family back east a few years ago to to take that position 
 Kind of interesting 
 Uh a- anyhow
