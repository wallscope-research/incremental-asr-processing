 Well I don't really like that very much
 What was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff
 Oh
 Oh yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Well that that's not really good 
 I don't know 
 I guess that's an invasion of privacy 
 I'm not sure that that's an everyday thing though at least not for you know an individual
 Something that I feel is a is a pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that's really so common that it's accepted as the norm now is the op- the open office concept
 Uh-huh 
 where they have the you know the little partition dividers throughout a a large room 
 and and people have little cubicles 
 Well that's all fine and good 
 but you don't really have any privacy at all
 Right
 Yeah
 And and it's not it's not just that 
 it's uh the whole thing about you know if if you're trying to concentrate well it's rather hard 
 sometimes it's almost impossible to do because um you know you're uh you're time you're space is is not your own space
 And I work in a situation like that 
 and I I really kind of have a problem with that
 Oh yeah 
 Is there anybody who doesn't
 Um
 Yeah
 Um
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I don't I don't think that's that's quite right either
 Yeah
 Hum what do you think could be done about it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 It really is 
 It's 
 something that something that I've just had a a dealing with is like a credit bureau
 Well they take they take my name which is a very common name 
 and my last name is even more common
 and they <> they check that name against uh their list 
 and they find several 
 And without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all they just report everything under that name
 They don't they don't even check my Social Security number
 And companies are paying them good money to report accurately 
 and they're not 
 they're so lazy 
 They're just not doing it 
 I mean they just find your name 
 and they match it up
 You know and that just drives me crazy because they're 
 and then they want 
 then you know to get it removed they say well you know you have to write this write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them you know 
 and then it takes three weeks and all 
 And I'm like baloney
 You messed it up 
 you fix it
 No 
 what I've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report
 like uh uh recently I was reported as having J C Penney accounts 
 and I don't 
 So I called J C Penney 
 and I said uh I just wanted to let you know that the credit agency you're using is incorrectly reporting the information that you're providing to them 
 And they say uh-huh because they really don't want to pay for a service that's not being done properly either
 So then they can call the credit bureau and say hey you know we're paying you good money to report this properly 
 and you're not doing your job
 So that's what I've taken to doing lately 
 and it seems to work pretty well so far
 Not that I can think of
 Yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 I probably better let you get back to work
 Okay
 All rightie
 Bye-bye
