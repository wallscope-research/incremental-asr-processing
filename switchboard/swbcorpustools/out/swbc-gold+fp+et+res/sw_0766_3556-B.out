 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well okay uh 
 most of most of the uh commercial television these days I'm just a little bit sick of 
 Uh in fact I don't watch hardly any uh television at all with uh my other activities 
 Uh between my family and my church et cetera et cetera well I don't have time I hardly any time to sit down and watch the news 
 Now I do watch the Discover channel and some on channel thirteen 
 but uh aside from aside from that I pretty well uh turn it off
 Uh-huh
 I don't blame you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I well it 
 sometimes if if it's real good 
 like there's more there's been more than one evening that I've uh caught uh every animal show that evening on uh on the Discover channel
 And uh because they're uh they're they're you know they're documentaries and they're 
 Oh you bet 
 in fact I'm glad that it's part of our uh basic cable package
 But uh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh oh me too
 Hello 
 Well they they who- they whooped up on them
 Uh-huh 
 and they're in the playoffs 
 and I'm not sure that the Eagles are not
 I did
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Did you know everybody or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson 
 but uh he's uh he's brought the pokes uh from a a one and something team to uh playoffs in what three years now
 Uh-huh 
 well it's uh you know it was the time for the passing of the guard I mean
 And I think Tom knew it
 So uh 
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 and I wouldn't I wouldn't have blamed him one bit because 
 yeah 
 but see nobody remembers him as a loser because he's too he's too far he's far too much of a gentleman and a and a practicing Christian to uh to ever be thought of as anything but a lo- you know but a winner 
 Yeah
 Oh he is 
 he is
 because he has to like himself before he can like other people Uh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Oh he will
 Right 
 Well nobody's going to forget Tom Landry
 Shoot come now 
 I mean I'd not a 
 you betcha 
 I'm not a native Texan by birth 
 but uh I guess if I uh length of length of time I'm in the state now is what after you're here twenty years you're considered native
 Well let's see 
 I came down March of sixty-nine went to work for T and I
