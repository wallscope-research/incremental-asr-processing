 Uh on Rutherford
 It's uh corner of New York uh just west of Mayfield
 Uh 
 Oh okay
 Oh they're they're little ones 
 Oh
 Let's see we're on government whether we think it's honest or can be 
 I I don't think under the way the system is right now it is
 The ultimate power ultimately re- corrupts
 I don't know if there is enough money that you could pay them just you know X amount of money to keep them honest 
 I just I just don't uh 
 Right 
 We had uh here in Oklahoma we had a few years ago a major uh corruption on on our county commissioners
 and there were several counties uh including the one I was in that lost every one of their county commissioners 
 and I mean it was to the point of not just losing their job but going to jail
 Oh they were taking kickbacks
 Yeah 
 Just a little here a little there
 Major amount here a major amount there 
 But I think there was something like you know thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail
 Uh that's that's small scale 
 I don't know you know 
 I really don't know what could be done Uh 
 That's right
 The cover-ups and 
 I uh I don't know 
 I just uh I'd like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests
 I think that's what upsets me worse than that they're getting a little you know uh on the side that that it seems that when they get up there it's it's what if I vote your way what it'll do for me rather than this is the way my constituents want it
 run 
 Maybe 
 and then you think well if it was longer terms then they would never have to try to please the people at home 
 I don't think that they anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government
 Well I wonder if they really were or if we just really didn't
