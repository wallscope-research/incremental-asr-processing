 Well I'd encourage it
 It's a good general e- ed- education for a a bachelor's degree
 And obviously and obviously it's where they don't have a any post graduate program there 
 but you get a an excellent wide uh basis of topics 
 You know you get a good broad education out of it
 You don't they don't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors but maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there
 Uh
 Well the for some people it's good because they maybe they need a little discipline need a little reining in at that that stage in their life 
 Uh other people 
 it uh it's uh suffocating
 you know you kind of choke on it
 uh it it depends on the person on the individual 
 but uh the one factor I think more than anything else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just the the cost of how much you're going to pay no matter where you go to school
 And if you've been in for twelve years I'm sure you've you've got a your share of student loans that uh you're probably going to be paying off or have been 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's good
 Oh y- I mean I know people that graduated or that I went to high school with that went to civilian colleges 
 and they they've got twenty thirty thousand dollar debts 
 I mean you could have uh 
 Yeah
 Exactly
 It's it's staggering when you think that just here in central New York is uh 
 Hamilton College is just a few miles south of you know maybe about twenty miles to the south from where I am
 and uh they're looking for twenty-two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now
 A year
 At just a small 
 I mean they they they are s- it is a select college
 Oh yeah 
 But you're talking incredible tuitions now
 I don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot 
 Very few I would imagine
 But uh I get 
 I just couldn't ima- 
 I mean it's more money that I make in a year 
 so 
 You know it you know 
 me being one person with a above the median income for New York state you know 
 I'm a s- I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now 
 and uh I 
 even as a somebody making twice what I was making how could you put half of that into to your child's education 
 and then just when they make made make it to the college years it's 
 My God I can't imagine
 Yes
 Or it's also a good environment 
 it may be good for someone who already has self discipline who has a certain amount of leadership quality in their own that 
 And that 
 yeah 
 the s- 
 it's the same
 It can benefit different people different ways
 But uh you know I I agree with that because I see people that I know f- again from high school that I still keep in touch with that didn't go to college 
 and they do the same old things they did in high school and*[[needs slash because following utt by B repeats utt of A; is not necessarily the intended end of this utt]] Same patterns of behavior same uh same socializing same exact crowd that they hang with 
 and it's like it's like frozen time you know
 It is 
 It really is that they haven't found anything anything better that uh 
 or their their experiences haven't been broadened at all to to you know you know 
 it's it's a it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions 
 and you hear all these different sides of the story that you never thought of
 and uh that's another big thing I think people get out of college is the appreciation for different point differing points of view you know or different opinions
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 yeah
 Oh I 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well your education's a lot what you make of it too 
 so 
 Yeah
 Well I I've seen more graduates from M I T 
 and that 
 being 
 I work in a in a labora- an Air Force laboratory 
 and so we've got a lot of uh M I T graduates that are in there 
 and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that I think I've ever run into
 Even even more so uh like military academy grads are a strange lot too 
 I I mean I have to ad- confess to that
 Yeah 
 and they have their own quirks and tolerances and you know certain things that don't bother us at all that would drive other people nuts 
 and then certain things that 
 ways things we do 
 the way we do it that drive other people nuts that 
 But these M I T grads are off in their absolute own world 
 It it's a 
 I I have more re- I have a lot of respect for M I T master's and doctorate uh degrees 
 but they're undergrads are like 
 I I'm amazed at at that's a lot of them even graduated
 But uh I don't know
 Right
 Right
 Nope
 Yeah
 No
 It's interesting that you mention 
 and I didn't think about that before when you were talking 
 but the service academies have all all the faculty uh for the most part is is military with a few exchange instruct- professors from other schools 
 But uh having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there uh is investing in the Air Force 
 and it 
 or the the military itself it's the future officer corps 
 and so I hear hor- horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors 
 they could never get extra help
 For me any time I needed extra help any time of the day I had all my instructors home phone numbers
 and could call them 
 you go to their office anytime 
 I had some instructors that uh would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends when I was having trouble with something 
 and 
 No 
 no 
 and that 
 No
 Right 
 right 
 Publish first 
 and the 
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's there's a lot of factors that people don't ever ever consider in in their selection of a college 
 and uh I don't know 
 maybe I wonder if if they enter these conversations that people have been having uh
