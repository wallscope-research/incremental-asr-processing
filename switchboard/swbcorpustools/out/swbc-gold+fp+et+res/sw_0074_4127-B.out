 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 do you use a computer
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 mine is really simple because I got all our bills paid off when uh he was a Marine 
 he went to Saudi Arabia 
 and while he was gone I got all of our bills paid off 
 so really the only bills I have is rent utilities insurance you know 
 so they come in 
 I pay them 
 and that's it you know 
 that's about the extent of it you know 
 I don't really have this major budget or anything 
 I just really I'm real thrifty 
 I take care of you know two children and me and uh just real careful with the money you know What little we have 
 so that's what I do
 No
 Uh-uh 
 You know I mean I I I've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt you know 
 you buy something on credit 
 and you pay twice as much for it when you get done You know 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 I don't have too many I don't have too many weaknesses 
 but I found out a credit card was one of them You know 
 it's so much easy easier you know if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person
 it's like oh it's on sale 
 let's go grab it you know 
 so uh and if you don't have the money then use a credit card 
 so I got rid of them credit cards You know 
 Yeah 
 that was my weakness 
 It wasn't bad 
 I mean I didn't have like thousands of dollars you know and like that 
 just I just learned that that wasn't for me you know
 So but I self-employed you know 
 I have my own little cleaning business type thing 
 so uh I keep 
 No 
 it's not hard 
 I just keep it in a notebook and write down what I've made and uh you know what it's going to have to go for that month 
 and you know it's not that not that hard Not at all
 So I always do my own income tax you know
 Do you
 Huh
 R- 
 all you got to do is read a book I mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go 
 I mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to 
 it's dumb 
 I guess if you had some really complicated stuff 
 but I don't 
 so I don't mess with it
 But I don't use a calculator either you know 
 I don't I don't have that mu- that many you know things to add up 
 so 
 Oh yeah
 And we have a 
 I bank at N C N B here 
 and they have a number that you can call in 
 and I always call in and like once every other week or so 
 and I will uh check off what checks have cleared 
 and 
 Do you do that
 You do too
 And I always check them off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because I always want to know exactly what I have you know
 I do that real often 
 I do that 
 so anyway
