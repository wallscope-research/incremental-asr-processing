 Oh uh-huh
 Well no 
 would they 
 no
 Well both of mine are boys 
 They're eight and eleven
 and they're into sports
 I mean as a matter of fact that's what we're doing tonight 
 Baseball has started
 Oh oh yes 
 we start here at uh five
 Up until 
 it's coach pitch until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in May 
 So he's going to be with uh regular pitching
 and my eleven year old of course you know is pitching
 Uh-huh
 But yes 
 we're into baseball 
 and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball 
 We even have peewee basketball here
 So there's always something
 Both 
 If we're not doing sports we go somewhere
 Oh yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 No 
 usually in the summer time
 Different places every year 
 We 
 No 
 Uh-huh 
 You know I've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often 
 and that must be the thing 
 They really hadn't either 
 They went to the Memorial you know 
 when they go it's on business
 it's not really just to getting to sight see
 Oh I bet it is too 
 Uh-huh
 Oh now my husband and I we go different places 
 But our child- but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close
 Oh yes 
 yes 
 yes 
 Oh 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Oh yes 
 but we try you know I try 
 my husband also we're involved in everything our kids does
 because uh my dad died you know when I was less than a year old
 so I always just had a mother 
 So I always thought when I have kids you know I really want to be involved with them
 Material things 
 yes 
 that is 
 yes
 Uh-huh
 Best friends now
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 you have to
 I mean you honestly do 
 Now I have friends that I love to death 
 but and they have children 
 but their children does anything 
 we have to take them and you know to do it 
 And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while 
 because you're saying Well I work full time too you know 
 Yeah 
 oh yeah
 Problem 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I agree with you very much so 
 Now we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college 
 and we knew time wise or and money wise too
 would it would not have been a good idea to had them then
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 That's right 
 but you can't take this money with us though
 that's how I keep looking at it
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 if you cou- if you can 
 yeah
 Yeah
 What are you learning to be
 What degree I mean what are you wanting to do after you get out of college
 Oh that's 
 my husband's into uh computers
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 And you don't want to
 No 
 no
 Oh
 Oh
 Then you'll never leave
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Well maybe something will open up for you
 Uh-huh
 Well may-
