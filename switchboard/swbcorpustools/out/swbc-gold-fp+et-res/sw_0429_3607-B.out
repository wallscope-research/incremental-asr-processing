 Well done a little repair on the shingles on the roof recently 
 We've had a lot of wind around here
 Yes 
 It looks like I'm going to have to get up there again because we may have a leak
 We've been getting quite a bit maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio 
 but well I'm right 
 Plano's just north of Dallas
 and there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas that are under water right now I guess 
 I saw on the news
 Well we're north and about I don't know eighty to a hundred miles south of the Oklahoma line I guess
 we did have a little bit of rain yesterday 
 So far we haven't had any today 
 And I suppose that means I should be getting up there to look at that shingle 
 but I had something else planned today 
 so I guess I'll let it go awhile
 They're 
 no 
 they're wood shake
 Yeah 
 No 
 I 
 as a matter of fact we've never had a leak actually yet 
 Now this 
 we just bought the house last year 
 and just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles 
 So I've just recently had to start looking at it myself
 So it's a small problem so far 
 but I guess you just have to keep on top of it 
 What kind of roof do you have
 then you don't have to do too much with it 
 Uh-huh
 it's pretty steep 
 parts of it are steeper than others
 Well you wear shoes with good traction and try to remember where you are at all times 
 And remember to yell Geronimo if all else fails
 It's actually just twelve years old now
 Yeah 
 it 
 this part of the country 
 actually they say that when the house is fifteen it's already old 
 but just take good care of it
 Thing is 
 the main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some squirming I call it of the foundation 
 We're just on a concrete slab you know
 but the soil right under this is a clay 
 and it 
 Well depending on it's moisture content it either swells up or shrinks 
 and of course the soil right under the slab retains it's moisture a lot longer
 and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from drooping
 but anytime there's a change in the weather like the temperature drastic changes in temperature or in moisture you get little spider web cracks all around windows and doors
 Well usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped 
 and then you patch them up 
 well it's all drywall
 I think with 
 yeah 
 right
 But somehow or other that does manage to show these little cracks 
 I don't know quite how that works 
 Maybe it isn't drywall 
 I don't really know
 Yeah 
 I think it is
 I expect that's what it is 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that's the way this is done 
 Fortunately we haven't had any real big holes in it yet 
 so I 
 Yes 
 well the previous owner had a major problem with it because probably a variety of things 
 His neighbor used
