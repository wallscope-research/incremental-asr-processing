 Okay 
 right now we're living in 
 well it's me my wife and two young boys 
 And right now we're in I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home Which you might call it 
 So we don't have a big yard 
 but when my wife and I first moved in it was just the two of us 
 So it was enough
 and it's I guess what they call a story and a half 
 Because it's not a full two story Where you know everything on top is on bottom 
 So it's got real high ceilings on half the house 
 and the other half is just standard sized ceilings
 And it's about a five year old house now
 It's pretty nice 
 Unfortunately the builder who built it went out of business already 
 Yeah 
 It was a 
 Landmark is the one who built it
 Yeah
 That's true
 Exactly what happened to them
 that's nice
 really
 Are you doing it yourself
 Wow
 that's nice
 I see
 
 Yeah 
 That's great
 R- 
 is that so 
 I didn't know that 
 Well that sounds kind of dumb
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 
 That's right 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Uh-huh 
 That's good
 Yeah 
 How big a lot do you got it on
 Wow 
 That's nice 
 That's real nice
 Oh
 God 
 That's pretty good
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 that's pretty good
 Uh-huh
 you don't plan on putting any of that in
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Yeah 
 That's pretty good
 Yeah
 Wow
 My wife would love that 
 She loves lots of windows
 That's great
 Is it a single story
 I see
 Uh-huh
 I see
 Oh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's kind of like a Victorian style
 Yeah 
 I've always liked that 
 The 
 you know we don't have much yard 
 but I built a small deck in the back
 But you know I see these magazines where you know dig your own deck
 I kind of wish I had them those size property and one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck
