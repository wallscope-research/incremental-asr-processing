 to Williams College in Massachusetts And that he was trying to decide between University of Pennsylvania and Williams 
 and it was a very difficult choice 
 and *[[slash unit]] No 
 *[[should be nn slash bug]] but that's one of the reasons why he chose Williams that it has solid liberal arts *[[end of slash unit]] About two thousand
 *[[should be indep slash unit See B8]] Very excited 
 yes *[[should be ny; looks like a slash unit to me ]] I have another son who's at their chief rival Amherst College
 *[[should be independent slash unit See B12 utt2]] Well they're really very strong academic rather than you know big sports
 We're outside of Washington in Maryland 
 How about you
 Uh-huh 
 do you have children in 
 Okay 
 Well I 
 one of the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job
 but what you can't learn on a job is a good solid well-rounded education
 That's right you know 
 the Renaissance man
 and if you get that you can 
 and if you do well you can learn a job
 That's exactly right
 That's right
 So the advice we gave to them was number one visit the colleges that you're thinking about describe first of all the size school that you might be interested in
 do you want to go away 
 how far from home do you want to be
 What do you want in a college 
 Now my son is a national level competitive swimmer
 so he wanted to swim in school 
 but he did not want to be in a swim factory
 That's right 
 that's the University of Texas at Austin or Stanford or something like that so he didn't even consider those
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 He is very very strong academically 
 yeah 
 so we've just 
 but you know he had to look to see what kind of environment he liked 
 and yet he did wind up having to make a choice 
 He did apply to a large you know large group
 It's got about nine thousand undergraduate
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yes 
 but it does have the under you know 
 that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school so that the the college of arts and sciences is you know I guess about four thousand
 At Pennsylvania
 Williams is an undergraduate school only
 and it's a total of two thousand
 Yeah 
 so he knew the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which is fifteen hundred
 and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew that he liked the environment
 but he did go on college visits 
 and he liked 
 Yes 
 yes
 it's large 
 and both boys had decided no that they did not want that
 it's 
 so you 
 Uh-huh
 And did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner
 No 
 but we've been there when whose gone up there 
 it 
 we went 
 and he was you know impressed by the clean air 
 and he met the students at both schools 
 and he liked them
 Uh-huh
 That's it
 The thing is if a person really knows very early on that they want to go in a technical field then it's probably good you know to apply to a school with a good technical program 
 but if you're going into 
 if you know engineering is the thing then you've got to at least take engineering
 That's right 
 Uh-huh
 No 
 he didn't apply to any school further 
 the furthest away was Bowdoin in Maine which is about twelve hours
 Yeah 
 that was the furthest and then Kenyon in Ohio which was about six and a half hours 
 and Williams is about seven
 Yeah 
 so well I mean he so it wasn't 
 he you know 
 then the University of Pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train 
 and then Bucknell in mid-state Pennsylvania
 Yeah 
 and he will 
 and it came down I mean as he came 
 he's been talking to them 
 and he came down 
 and one of the things that he said is he went to Pennsylvania this weekend 
 and he had an absolutely marvelous time
 he had a great time 
 but then he said you know it was such a good time that I almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun
 and he said it almost back- 
 I think it backfired
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Of course that period too was probably difficult
 But I did 
 my advice to him was that he had to really decide what he wanted out of college 
 He had to look at himself 
 in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it he could probably slip 
 and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school where especially in a Kenyon or a Williams where you see the professors around town all the time you skip class in the morning and they see you
 That's 
 yeah 
 yeah
 And a swim coach is going to be right on top of you 
 and he will know the professors in a small 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 That's right 
 that's right
 and it's just the personal contact where if you need help 
 he had 
 I told him to look to yourself 
 Are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says I've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred that you're really going to look him up
 but if it's a class of fifteen and you need help you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures
 and even though they may break it up into smaller groups Penn is known for having graduate assistance teaching 
 They have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups
 he made the decision I'd say about an hour and a half ago 
 Yeah 
 I mean that's so funny I mean 
 and in fact he had just an hour before that two recent graduates from Kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him
 I mean and they were really nice 
 but he said that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know 
 but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better
 Yeah 
 yeah
 My other son is just as happy as a bed bug
 He 
 the moment he knew he decided early on that Amherst was the school 
 He's a classical guitarist
 and he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate for classical guitar 
 but he decided he was going to go to the smaller now and then graduate school later
 Well my older boy's real happy 
 and he's minoring in English 
 and he had thought about economics 
 and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't 
 he's going to be a junior 
 He'll be he's finishing his sophomore year so he's double majoring
 Well you know see the advice we give is to not limit yourself especially this you know go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two
 Yeah
 Well one of the things we said is that they should pick the college 
 this was our advice too irrespective of the cost That somehow we would manage
 Well we place a real high priority on education in our family
 good 
 that's wonderful
 that's great
 That's right 
 that's exactly
