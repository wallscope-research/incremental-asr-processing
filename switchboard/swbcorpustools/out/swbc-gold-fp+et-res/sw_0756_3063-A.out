 we are to discuss air pollution and what we think the causes are/
 And I probably would target industry as being number one polluter
 Well vehicles 
 and 
 yes
 Right 
 because there's a lot of commercial vehicles out there especially the big rigs like the busses and the big eighteen wheelers and so forth
 I think one of them would probably generate enough for three cars
 But that's not 
 and I think it can be resolved if they really let go with the technology that they have at their hand 
 and they haven't released it yet
 I think there's a lot of hold back because of priorities that they have you know
 and it's 
 You have some children
 okay 
 do you watch children 
 or do you 
 Uh-huh
 Well that's interesting
 is there anything 
 Well temporarily they do
 Then we get out of that phase soon enough
 yes
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 sure
 Uh-huh 
 Well I know in Michigan the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it 
 and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air
 And of course now 
 No 
 and when they 
 and you bury it 
 and it's not gone either because it has untold ramifications
 And it gets into people you know which is the most important resource that we have is people 
 and they're destroying us 
 they really are
 So I think the cockroach will evolve safely 
 So they say 
 Yes 
 but there's not enough
 And we need expert cooperation
 Yeah 
 Education of the people is primary I would think
 and we're hard to teach
 We are hard to teach
 Absolutely 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Absolutely 
 yes 
 of course we would like to see it accelerated because of the critical nature of it
 the learning of it and the 
 just to think that way we have to be in that thought pattern and able to motivate ourselves to do what is right for the atmosphere
 I think we're all contributors 
 I mean every human being that lives is a contributor to pollution 
 so we just <> 
 Uh-huh
 Well hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past That the time frame for cleaning up our air and our land you know which we get our nutrients from 
 You know I mean everything goes back to the land
 So it's just very critical I think at this point to get that through to the people and get us educated
 Uh-huh
 I don't know if they offer classes in the grade school subjecting 
 In science 
 okay
 What grade level would that be 
 Would that be perhaps the first grade level which would be 
 Well I mean are they starting though with the children that are so 
 their little minds are like sponges 
 and they can really relate to that
 Target stores
 okay
 Okay
 I see
 <> Uh-huh 
 help fight the pollution
 that's wonderful
 Well I'm sure that perhaps they're the leaders you know 
 and others will pick up on their example and carry it further
 You know because thoughts are 
 <> Uh-huh
