 Okay 
 Well why don't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask you what do you 
 Yes 
 I do
 my gosh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 Right
 My mother-in-law finally 
 They had to make a family decision 
 There's seven children in my husband's family 
 and fortunately four of them live in the same home town 
 and she has Alzheimer's 
 It was getting where she was getting dangerous I mean letting strangers in and things like this 
 but they were very fortunate 
 It's a small town 
 and she happens to room with one of the doctor's mother's 
 and then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time 
 but she really doesn't 
 Nobody thought she would adjust 
 but she has adjusted beautifully
 But then I am also facing my father who is very sick 
 and my mother and father reside in Colorado 
 She's been taking care of him 
 I don't know how much longer this can last 
 and at that point because he requires round the clock 
 He can't do anything without her 
 He doesn't know when to take his medicine 
 and it's really sad 
 and I have thought if something would happen to my mother for 
 my brother's are not interested in helping me 
 so I would have to move him down here 
 That way 
 I want to see the nursing home If I have to put him into one 
 You know where I can go see it 
 I'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado 
 And 
 Yes 
 And some of them are limited care too where people can do 
 like they have apartment styles 
 but that wouldn't work for him 
 I think he is beyond that 
 Where if you need help you can get it 
 but basically people kind of have a small apartment 
 and doctor's are available if they need them
 And allows 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well the only problem with these are that they are very expensive 
 Of course I guess all nursing homes there is 
 but 
 Right
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 I 
 yeah 
 and I think a lot of people who do it now 
 In Colorado it's interesting 
 I talked to my mother 
 They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home 
 And my mother could make it on that 
 What she probably would do is disburse the money to me 
 and then I would send it back to her 
 so that's what would happen
 Yeah 
 It's unfortunate 
 Right
 Yeah 
 It's frightening 
 And I guess I don't know how old you are 
 I'm forty-six 
 You know we're the generation moving into this 
 and I don't know how our kids are going to take care of us You know
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 I also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise 
 and he's still living at home 
 and I don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are
 And so it's kind of 
 you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations 
 but something will have to change as more and more of us get older 
 luckily if we could be like your grandmother you know I would love to live to a hundred and two if I were okay 
 But you see these people in their seventies 
 yeah 
 most aren't 
 That's the problem
 That's incredible
