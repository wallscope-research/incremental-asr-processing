 Now is it Stacy
 Angie 
 I'm sorry
 Well now so if you were going to have a dinner party what would you make
 That sounds good
 Now what is the steamed shellfish you said
 And what would that be like a clam or 
 Okay
 So if you have a dinner party and you're going to serve seafood for supper what type of hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal
 Like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or 
 Probably not nachos and dip 
 And would it be appropriate to drink when you have the hors d'oeuvres
 Okay 
 And then when you serve the meal what type of wine would you have with seafood
 That would be my guess
 And then dessert 
 Something sweet
 You must like chocolate
 Well let's see 
 Usually when we have a dinner party I like to grill
 So we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some dip some cheese 
 One of our favorites is to take some let's see Philadelphia cream cheese I think is that what comes in those little blocks And pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and wash them and cool them and then dump them in the sauce and then take crackers 
 and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese 
 and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail 
 And then I like to barbecue like steaks or pork chops 
 And then lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them and a salad 
 and then I don't know what we usually have for dessert 
 Cake sometimes 
 but that's what we would do for a dinner party I guess
 But that's more for like when friends come over
 Traditional 
 yeah
 I wouldn't be the big snotty kind
 Huh-uh
 well do you work in a setting where you are in the food business
 Is it in Dallas
 Okay 
 all right 
 So you graduated from which high school
 Trinity 
 okay 
 And that's a public school or private
 okay 
 I have to get to know this area a little better I guess 
 well is your father's cafe one that you could cater out of
 and he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably
 Well let's see 
 what else for catering 
 that would be good
 And you could actually go with a chicken if you wanted to
