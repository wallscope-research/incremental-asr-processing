 Well are you a fisher person are you
 Great 
 What kind of fishing do you do
 In California
 Oh
 Well what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Well I don't blame you 
 I grew up in Nebraska and grew up cat fishing in the Little Blue River 
 and then we moved to South Dakota and did a lot of Walleye fishing on the Missouri River 
 and now that we are down here I think a lot of people do some bass fishing and strip bass fishing 
 but I am sort of a catfish man at heart
 Yep 
 Yeah 
 they do
 Oh
 Yeah
 yeah 
 I like to fish 
 The only problem is I just moved to Texas 
 so it's been a little over a year now 
 but I am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here 
 and I really I haven't gone fishing for about two years now
 and it's driving me crazy 
 but one of these days I will go over to Lake Lewisville or what is it Lake Ray Hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while 
 Well yeah 
 sure
 Well mo- 
 Yeah 
 Most of the time if we catch something we'll take it home and eat it 
 and you're right 
 I mean I like to fish for trout 
 and they are really good fighters 
 but if I went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing I would order if I had a choice of fish on the menu
 Yeah
 Well so do you just skin your catfish 
 or do you fillet them out 
 how do you 
 Do you
 Okay
 Yeah
 No
 Well that's how we do it too 
 although we use to set some trout lines out 
 and we've caught you know fourteen fifteen pound catfish 
 and sometimes those are good to do on a barbecue grill and just leave the skin on and do it with butter on tin foil
 and then the skin just basically scrapes right off 
 and wer- 
 and it really tastes pretty good
 There 
 Yeah
 Well I am hoping one of these days I'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on a rod and reel 
 but so far it's just been on the trout lines 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 And well up in South Dakota in the Missouri River there we've tied into a few northern pike 
 and they really 
 in 
 when the water is cold they are very slow moving fish 
 but in the summer time they'll give you a run for your money
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 In Nebraska
 yeah 
 Most of the time we just fished in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in
 And a lot of them ended up being close to the river 
 so if the river every flooded you know then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits
 and so we would do a lot of fishing there too 
 but South Dakota didn't really have much for
