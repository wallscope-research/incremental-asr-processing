 How do you feel about the Viet Nam war
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I saw that as well
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well were you ever in Viet Nam 
 or 
 I was much too young 
 I was born in sixty-seven 
 so 
 you know well both my brothers were draft age 
 but neither of them wound up going over which I think they were very happy for
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well so well do you feel that it was worth what we did over there
 Okay
 I mean do you think the investment in lives and money was worth it
 I totally agree with that 
 what effects do you think it's had on our country
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I think you know that's pretty typical of the entire involvement over you know that nothing was really addressed 
 you know it was never 
 we announced that we were going to war
 it was such a gradual and subtle you know you know increasement of force that
 I vaguely remember we had a spy ship torpedoed or something
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 so do you think that like for example like in this past war in the Persian Gulf war you see it seemed to me that Bush was going to extraordinary lengths to you know prepare the country for war
 Yeah
 Okay
 I wasn't really keeping count 
 But I guess 
 good-bye 
 Bye
