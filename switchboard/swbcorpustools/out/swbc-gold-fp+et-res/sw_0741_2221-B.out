 Well you know they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers
 but you know it's pretty hard to try let's say the man down the street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people 
 like the juries that I've served on are businessmen
 Okay 
 now they don't understand that you know maybe he needed fifty dollars
 so he held up the seven eleven
 *[[Seven Eleven]] Okay 
 they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars all the time 
 so you know I think that a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket 
 you know you can't really do it ethnically you know 
 but you could probably get it a little closer 
 But then there's another thing that I disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six 
 and sometimes you have a jury of twelve
 And I don't know why they do that 
 Do you have any reason 
 do you know of any reason why they do that
 Okay 
 see <>
 Okay <>
 I don't know much about the Grand Jury 
 How do you feel about the 
 in Texas I noticed since I've been here twelve years that they break up the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial
 Well we know there's a few out there
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's 
 Yeah 
 would be pretty hard 
 Well you know I don't think that if I was the criminal that I would like the judge passing sentence on me 
 If the jury found me guilty then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be 
 And I think it's 
 not only that it's a waste of our money 
 We have to have a trial for this person 
 then two weeks down the road we have to excuse me set a sentencing date so now we're back in court again 
 and that's more money spent
 No
 And it's not working either
 It seems that we have more and more repeat offenders
 I know 
 I don't know how you all are there where you're at 
 but where we're at now our jails are overcrowded 
 We just built a brand new one two years ago
 And it's overcrowded
 So now they start turning them loose
 They turn them loose
 Yeah
 Well it seems the way it's been working here's 
 Go ahead 
 *[[ LISTEN are utterances 1 and 2 really from the same speaker ]] It seems the way it's been working here is they let those out that have spent two or three years out of their five to twenty sentence or five to life
 Yeah 
 that 
 Yeah 
 and They keep 
 Yeah
 All right
 All right
 Yeah 
 it would allow *[[ slash error ]] Yeah 
 instead of being completely penned up
 And that way it would give you know 
 the probation department and parole department they've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in Lubbock
 And that would give you know 
 at least they don't have to drive all over town trying to find one guy or trying to see six or seven people
 Sometimes it's pretty messed up 
 isn't it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well see 
 and there's another thing about the justice system that I don't like
 and there's a lot of people that tell me that maybe my thoughts are wrong 
 I came from California
 and when you're in jail they take you out just like they do in Alabama or anywhere else what they call a chain gang
 And they clean the city parks
 And they clean the city streets 
 But you know we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day 
 and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner
 and I know 
 yeah
 but I know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock that don't make that much
 And you know they're not doing anything to support themselves while they're there
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well Uh-huh 
 See now 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 but at least that way they would be helping pay for their own
 And something else that I would like to see is victim reimbursement you know because they you know like you say these guys are in jail 
 and they're working 
 they're getting paid 
 but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from or beat to death 
 or 
 has nothing you know 
 our victims are victimized period 
 and the law has no regulations to deal with that
 they know how to deal with the penal system 
 and they know how to deal with the criminal 
 but they don't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens I guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect
 But it's 
 but I sure don't 
 I strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself
 There that 
 Yeah 
 because well see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime
 the jury gets to see the whole trial as does the judge 
 but you know if they figure there's maybe litigating circumstances or something like that whereas maybe the judge just doesn't care you committed this crime 
 so I'm just going to throw the book at you
 Whereas the jury may have a little shall we say sympathy you know 
 he did this 
 but you know why did he do this
 is there a basis for it
 Yeah 
 in some cases where the judge says okay I'll give you you know two to three years 
 and 
 Yeah
 Well they have a stronger debate too because there's twelve people there 
 They have to decide whether or not he's guilty 
 and then they can sit at the same time and decide what his punishment would be
 and you'd have more than one person's input on it
 And you know we're supposed to be and I quote in a democratic society
 So you know if you can find me guilty then you ought to be able to pass sentence
 And a lot of jurors 
 not that I know of 
 but you know a lot of jurors may just sit there and say yeah he's guilty 
 but I don't have to deal with it from here you know 
 so the judge takes care of all of that
 Yeah 
 it would
 yeah 
 serving on the jury you'd have to be a definitely more responsible person
