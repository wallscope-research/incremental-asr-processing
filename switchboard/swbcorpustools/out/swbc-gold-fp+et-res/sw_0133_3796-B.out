 You know what 
 I watched a little bit of the Bulls game 
 and I had to leave 
 in fact I think the Bulls were ahead when I left 
 Who won the game
 Is that right
 Uh-huh
 Wow don't they have the best record now
 *[[ Shouldn't the "Wow" be an independent slash unit ]] Yeah
 Wow
 they do 
 and they you know 
 I think by relieving some of the pressure off of 
 Michael Jordan really helped them out 
 You know they don't have to rely on him to score you know thirty or forty points at every game 
 so 
 I know 
 I'm 
 yeah 
 [ I saw the w- + I saw just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors Dallas game
 They look good
 Yeah 
 now I haven't kept up with what was going on with the 
 Uh-huh
 Good move
 Yeah
 I think Boston's in first 
 you know I haven't kept up with any of the other teams 
 I'm so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks you know
 man 
 That 
 well yeah 
 but I mean just this whole year has been just disastrous for them 
 and you know I think they're going for an all time record of how many you know losses in a row they can pull out
 It's unbelievable
 
 Well actually the Dallas area here pulls for Dallas 
 San Antonio pulls for San Antonio 
 and Houston pulls for the Rockets
 There really 
 I mean not a whole lot You know 
 I mean you find them to be pretty loyal with the local teams
 you know I guess it's kind of like there in the Bay area you know you don't find a whole lot of Sacramento fans
 Really isn't 
 uh-uh
 it's about the same distance from here to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento
 So yeah it's not really a local you know 
 he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio 
 and I mean they have got a great club You know
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that always makes a big difference
 So 
 Yeah
 And you know you know I used to think that one player really doesn't make a club 
 but it really does you know
 You get somebody like Magic 
 and you can see the decline in that team
 Once he left you know it's not the same team 
 There's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for
 yeah 
 Who won that Portland game
