 I think one of the thing that I notice a lot 
 I know it's touching social changes 
 but to me what becomes socially acceptable 
 and I don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction 
 but I notice things on T V being open more I believe 
 they portray things on T V obviously that they never would have years ago 
 you know and specifically nudity things like that 
 I don't know 
 I've said several times to my husband that I feel like gee in ten years they'll have just full nudity on T V 
 and nobody will think anything of it 
 and to me that's surprising 
 To me that's a big change to accept it 
 and it comes across I think subtly you know a little at a time to where you get so used to seeing a little change that you know when they go one step further you don't notice it that much 
 That's one of the biggest ones I've seen
 What about you
 Uh-huh
 I tend to agree with you 
 and I think there's a lot of that 
 yeah 
 we have become lawsuit happy 
 Any little thing it's like let's see what I can get 
 Don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from you know the era we went through that was like you know hey if it makes you happy do it 
 You know kind of like disregard to others 
 do what makes you happy 
 and yes 
 we should take care of ourselves you know 
 and we should see to our own lives but not to a total disregard of others 
 I don't know 
 I think it's come to that a lot 
 I see it a lot in my daughter 
 I have a four year old
 And hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through 
 but whenever something happens it's you made me hit that 
 you made me do this 
 and so I try to tell her everything isn't always somebody else's fault 
 You know you have to watch where you're going 
 and so it's what you just said kind of hits home to me just through her 
 So I think you're right 
 in your opinion good or bad or both
 I do too 
 I think part of that 
 I don't know 
 I think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling like in terms of their self confidence their self worth you know I can do something 
 I can be somebody you know 
 if I put my mind to it I can accomplish things too 
 And I think that's good 
 but you know maybe I think when that was first trying come about with you know what we know as the women's lib movement
 I think it was too extreme 
 I think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too you know 
 and I think there's definite roles 
 and I think you know part of the break up of the family maybe it's because of the social changes 
 I don't know 
 the fact that during their early changes where you know women did maybe speak out I was going to say come more out of themselves 
 but speak out 
 I think a lot of men were threatened by that 
 I think now less men are you know because they're used to it 
 it's around them 
 but I don't know 
 I don't know why the families are breaking up 
 I think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions because it's like they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is going to work 
 They go in and say well hey you know I'll stick with it while it's good 
 and then I'll get out 
 And I think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment
