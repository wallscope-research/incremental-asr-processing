 I think life 
 now I grew up on a farm 
 I don't 
 what kind 
 did you grow up in the farm
 Uh-huh 
 I see well little bit different
 I think though it was much slower and much more self-contained
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 unreal by comparison
 Yeah 
 I think that's right
 I can remember as a child you know nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where I wanted to go
 it didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me 
 they were 
 No 
 no
 It's not all that long ago is it 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 we were living in New Jersey twenty years ago
 In Allendale 
 And I use to have to go over to Patterson when those riots were going on sometimes 
 I don't know though 
 it's kind of hard to really know because of 
 though the news media had those riots kind of blown up out of proportion 
 because I went there many times 
 and 
 I never saw a riot Did you 
 That's what 
 yeah 
 well 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 I think that's true 
 I think that's true 
 I think the other thing is that we have taken some rather drastic turns in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when I'm number one you know and worrying about self and not seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family
 and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged closeness of families and support for young people the kind of support that they need to help them take care of the things 
 if you don't have some kind of basic believe or something down inside of you then it's very difficult to have anything to turn to when you've got something facing you like that
 Uh-huh 
 Like 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 Yeah 
 That's right 
 that's right
 No 
 That's right 
 Oh 
 No 
 there's so much more then that 
 it starts very much deeper then that 
 I think that too 
 I see some flickers of good directions turning
 but whether they're soon enough and fast enough I don't know 
 it's just 
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that's right
 Right 
 And there's so many people on the lower end of those who are going to be the drop outs and the poor and the homeless and whatnot
 Yeah 
 that's just another 
 Yeah 
 It really is 
 it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think of the jobs that is out there to be done in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be
 not that I really think that they were perfect ten twenty or thirty years ago 
 but 
 yeah 
 just the volume makes a big difference
 as mother you know I use to think sometimes it's not so much the kids 
 it's just the volume of it to try to keep all wash done and all the things done you know and everything
 Right 
 Right and children's lives were simpler because mother was there 
 somebody was there
 and when there's nobody there 
 I always thought too that you know people worrying about going to work when their children are little 
 and I think that's sad if they have to because they miss so much 
 but I believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go work was when they were teenagers
 Right 
 it's not so much that they come to you every minute 
 but it's that you are there when they need you
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yes 
 I think that's true 
 Yeah 
 that's 
 Yeah 
 Well 
 But that helps a lot
 I have a daughter who just had a second job 
 she needed to work 
 and he opted to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so she would be able to interact with them
 and so I 
 you know good kind of experience as well 
 but 
 I think that's really important 
 I don't think people realize how important it is
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I think that's right 
 what was your name again
 Linda
 Okay
 Well I think probably that we've just about 
 I'm going to change the world 
 but 
 Yes 
 it's nice talking to you too
 Bye now
