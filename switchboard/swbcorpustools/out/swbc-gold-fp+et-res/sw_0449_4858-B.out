 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I was just in high school I guess when it ended
 Ended up being 
 I was in the last lottery
 And I was glad it was over by then
 I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there 
 Just because you know we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like 
 You know we 
 those people that I know 
 I work with several that were over there 
 and for some of them it was just kind of I don't know not so much a holiday 
 I guess that's how they tend to talk about it But that they just kind of lived out in the woods 
 and ever now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles 
 and then they'd come back 
 and you know 
 But that they weren't really allowed to do anything 
 I 
 to me it seems like we only went halfway If even halfway
 *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 *[[slash error]] Uh-huh 
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] Yeah 
 Well I think we did learn some lessons that we weren't prepared for 
 I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war
 I mean the other wars I mean they seemed like a valiant thing 
 you knew who was good 
 You knew who was bad
 And it was a traditional battle of kind of good versus evil you know whichever way it is 
 But in the Vietnam war it seems like it was 
 the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to whose good and whose bad 
 and you know the 
 even 
 it seems like even the people you know 
 had the South Vietnamese the North Vietnamese and of course the Laotians 
 and the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved 
 But 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
