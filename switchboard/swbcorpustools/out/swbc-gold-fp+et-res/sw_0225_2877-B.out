 I sure do 
 I have a cat and a dog named Joey
 Uh-huh
 he's the little boy Pomeranian
 And we just got a new addition to the family so to speak 
 we also have a fish
 It's a mud dog
 It's a mud dog 
 It's a cross between a catfish and I don't know what a salamander
 Uh-huh 
 we have a cat Stripper
 the mud dog
 we had a friend give it to us
 Yeah 
 we'd like to get him a friend 
 but we haven't found one yet 
 So how about you 
 do you have any pets
 really 
 what kind
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 how long have you had them
 Uh-huh
 no
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 is that right
 Huh 
 I had no idea 
 I didn't even know that
 our dog Joey has a back problem
 he's got a bad back 
 but he's seven 
 I guess he's almost eight years old
 he just 
 he doesn't 
 he rolls o- 
 he doesn't like to roll over
 e- 
 you just 
 when you touch him a certain way on the back 
 but otherwise he can jump you know just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way
 Uh-huh
 I bet
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Do you have to give those
 I 
 believe me I understand
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I've never heard anything about it either
 Uh-huh
 Does he get 
 is he an inside dog also
 or does he just run out in the backyard 
 Is he fenced in
 yeah 
 uh-huh
 that's nice
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Stripper well he started out being a little orphan 
 and we took him in 
 and he's about two years old now 
 and he loves his treats 
 both Joey and Stripper get treats 
 And let's see 
 well he's outside 
 and he's got a way to get in 
 he's got free access of a window we like to keep open
 So he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to
 Joey on the other hand is a little different 
 He has to go out whenever we ask him 
 and when we ask him he barks 
 He'll either bark for food or he'll bark to go out 
 and he'll tell you which one he wants 
 He's been through obedience school 
 definitely
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 I'm not for sure
 I think maybe we have 
 but 
 definitely 
 Have you ever done this before
 okay 
 I haven't ever called 
 I've put in the paper work I just never made the call
 Yeah 
 so I didn't know if they stop you when the time is up 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 well at least you know you did your part
 How did you get into this
 I see
 Uh-huh 
 that's true
 I mean I 
 yes 
 I do
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I was going to tell you the same thing 
 They're really looking for a lot more men to participate
 Does he 
 Yeah 
 I need to 
 I've got some applications 
 I need to hand them out 
 But this is a great project that they're working on 
 and it's really going to lead the way for a lot of applications and development in the voice area
 Uh-huh
 Well this is the perfect time for me
 Well maybe I'll get you next time 
 All right 
 have a good one
 Bye
