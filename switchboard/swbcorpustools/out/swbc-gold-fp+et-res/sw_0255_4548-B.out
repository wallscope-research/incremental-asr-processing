 really 
 You don't believe in it
 Yeah
 You sound a lot like a friend of mine a girl I hang out with 
 She has very black and white opinions you know 
 There's no gray in her opinions you know 
 she probably would agree more with you 
 but I don't know 
 I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again 
 I've never had a punishment or a crime like a murder touch my immediate family
 but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done
 And we see that more and more 
 Like in our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl
 you know that's fourteen years old 
 What's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult
 Yeah
 No 
 it doesn't 
 but it costs less
 And yeah 
 to me it is 
 I mean I work and I pay my taxes 
 and I lived out in Texas for a little while 
 and they're 
 and that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia 
 I mean you guys are a lot more for to each his own even than we are in Georgia
 But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part 
 If I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine
 But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I don't like you very much anymore 
 really 
 Yeah
 You might be right 
 I mean I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch you know
 I would never in a million years want that job
 but I do believe it's necessary 
 and I 
 On the one hand I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing 
 and I couldn't pull the switch 
 but 
 Yeah
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing 
 Yeah
 gosh 
 yes 
 if it ever touched my fam-
