 Uh-huh
 Right or their satellite dish 
 On top of the recreational vehicles
 Yeah 
 We have a little bit 
 and we've just gotten one of those little tents that we throw out on the ground 
 and that's what we camp in 
 So we kind of rough it
 Uh-huh
 no 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Bear bait 
 That would make me nervous 
 Have you done any camping around here
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 That sounds fun
 Right 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Do you go on long 
 Like a week at a time or just weekends
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I like the campgrounds that have a nice shower 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 we camped at the DeGray State Park in Arkansas In the Fall 
 and there was nobody else hardly around 
 and it was just really nice that time of year 
 We had taken our electric blanket too just in case it was unbearable 
 but we didn't need it <> 
 Yeah 
 really 
 Yeah
 yeah 
 Uh-huh
 That sounds nice
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's a lot of work to set up just for one night
 Right 
 Yeah 
 Those are nice 
 we have one of those too 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 How do you blow yours up
 Oh 
 we were looking at those in a magazine 
 Last time we went we took our vacuum cleaner with us 
 And yeah you can if you can reverse the nozzle on your vacuum cleaner
 and it blows air out instead of sucking it in 
 and you can fill them up that way 
 but something that's smaller would be a lot more convenient
 No 
 Uh-huh 
 my husband and I we have a pickup truck 
 so there's plenty of room to hold things
 Uh-huh
 no 
 Yeah
 Oh
 we take our dog camping 
 She likes to go out and stay in the woods
 she sleeps in the tent with us
 It's fun <>
 me either
 no 
 Uh-huh
 boy 
 That was lucky
 We've been lucky 
 We've never really been rained on the few times we've gone
 I bet it 
 when I was a kid we camped in Virginia 
 and we had one of those little pop up tents which is really nice because it kind of gets you off the ground 
 But it seemed like it rained every weekend for about the year we were really into camping
 No 
 It's a little trailer you pull behind your car 
 and you know the lid pops off
 the little tent comes up the top
 and it had two double beds in it
 since the beginning 
 I guess it's been two or three weeks
 well I work as a temporary in the Speech Lab
 Uh-huh 
 Where they're doing this program The Voice Recognition Program
 they turn them over to somebody 
 and I guess they're going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff
 Right 
 Yeah
 I don't know 
 I type up the tapes of what people talked about
 Yeah 
 it's sort of interesting
 Uh-huh 
 Everything like that 
 All the little stutters and everything
 Like if they say I I we just type it in like that
 Well I guess that's it for camping 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 uh-huh 
 That's what we have too 
 Yeah 
 that's what ours is
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 they pop up pretty fast
 Have you ever camped on sand
 That can be a mess 
 We camped at the beach one time 
 and that was sort of miserable 
 You just couldn- 
 everywhere you went there was sand 
 You couldn't 
 even when you're eating 
 it was in your bed 
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Well it's good talking to you
 Bye
