 Okay 
 let's see 
 How do you feel about credit cards
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 Right
 Wow
 Right
 Well me and my wife when we have like extra money that we know we're going to have and we can put it in our budget yeah we'll use it 
 But like last year I think we paid 
 I think it was like twenty something cents interest on our Visa
 And I think this year I think we used it for Christmas 
 and we got caught just a few days on our grace period 
 so we'll pay a little interest this year but maybe two dollars 
 But we don't like to do that at all
 And you know I think we feel about the same way you do real strongly 
 we have several credit cards though 
 We have a gas card our Visa and then of course the American Express 
 and I think we have a couple of department stores
 But we use it the same way 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Right
 it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill 
 That's usually how we do it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Right
 Right 
 That's good 
 I don't think we've gone that far to pay it you know in advance before we spend it 
 but I guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it like that that ] may be good
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
