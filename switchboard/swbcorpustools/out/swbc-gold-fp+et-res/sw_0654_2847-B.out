 boy 
 Well I haven't been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately 
 I read one book a friend recommended to me 
 I can't even remember the guy's name 
 It was a science fiction Dean Cole or something like that 
 And it was so frightening 
 and it had so much violence in it 
 I just could hardly stand it 
 Yeah 
 I didn't think it was so great 
 She thought it was riveting you know 
 but I couldn't deal with that 
 But mostly I read 
 I'm a marriage and family counselor 
 and mostly I read things to do with raising kids 
 and now I have two little kids
 or co-dependency or you know fifty thousand things like John Bradshaw's books on THE FAMILY and HOMECOMING and INNER CHILD and so 
 I read usually that kind of stuff 
 If 
 and right now I'm reading Judith Viorst's book called NECESSARY LOSSES where she talks about different losses that we've had in our lives that we have to get past if we're going to mature and so 
 in my spare time with a two and a half and a three and a half year old I read 
 Yeah 
 That's really changed my reading habits because I used to read so much especially when I was in school
 You know but gosh it's getting pathetic now 
 If I get through a magazine I've been 
 Yeah
 Later you're probably looking for your kids 
 so you can talk to them when they're out running around with friends 
 Yeah 
 What do you read
 You do 
 Who 
 well how interesting
 What kind of books 
 
 my goodness
 Yeah 
 Well that sounds like a fascinating job
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 That's true
 That's true 
 Well you probably 
 I seem to remember that little byline on a lot of things I've read
 is that 
 do they have a mail kind of campaign that they send to professionals in the social 
 No
 
 That sounds so familiar
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 that sounds interesting 
 Yeah 
 Oh 
 I thought that was going to be some- 
 Oh
 my goodness
 
 Uh-huh
 Nursing 
 or 
 Yeah
 Secretaries 
 I bet that used to be mostly men who were secretaries of any type for business
 Yeah 
 Oh
 Yeah
 Then you were important 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Like the scribes who did the old documents you know for churches and stu- 
 yeah 
 Well that's interesting
 Uh-huh
 
 Gosh 
 Really
 So are you reading these in the form of just like printed manuscripts that have not been pub-
 
 Yeah 
 My goodness 
 Well that's fascinating 
 Gosh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 
 I never have gotten into any of the romantic novels or any of that kind of stuff 
 My husband reads a lot of the 
 well he did before we had kids the STAR TREK and all those kind of sci-fi kinds of things you know 
 But he's got quite a collection of those 
 But my stuff revolves around one thou- let's see 
 I've got one called ONE THOUSAND PRACTICAL PARENTING TIPS which teaches you to put elastic instead of shoelaces in your kid's shoes 
 Hey 
 I've done that to every pair my three year old has
 You know really
 And 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 but there's a surprising number that are still around that don't have those 
 so that's an alternate means of dealing with 
 but I'm trying to think of what else I've got 
 since I'm a therapist and all I've done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step groups 
 So I've got all the different alcoholics what they call the blue book the big book and all the O A literature and all the CODA literature 
 so I'm trying to get more familiarized with that because I refer clients and different groups 
 and well let's see I'm trying to think of the 
 I have a love affair with John Bradshaw 
 I just have found everything I've read of his to be fabulous 
 he started out with one called THE FAMILY which does the family systems and people's roles in the family 
 And then he did HEALING THE SHAME THAT BINDS YOU about how shame can just be so paralyzing and people isolate and withdraw 
 And then the third one that he came out with is now called HOMECOMING 
 and there's a subtitle to it 
 I never can remember what it is 
 It's something like A JOURNEY IN YOUR INNER CHILD or something like that
 he's just great 
 And now he's had the first one and the third one put into a ten session P B S series
 Yeah 
 Oh
 I know 
 Yeah 
 so people can just tape them I guess you know 
 But I definitely have gotten a lot out of his lately 
 He's just probably been one of the most 
 there's an author that's in Arizona who used to be in Dallas 
 It seems like we have a lot of these that have been in Texas called P M Melody who does a lot of writing on co-dependency 
 And she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and a workbook called BREAKING FREE and just some real helpful practical things for co-dependency
 So that's been another one that I've thought was real helpful But other than that my reading centers on PADDINGTON BEAR and WINNIE THE POOH and DOCTOR SEUSS 
 But I really have enjoyed exploring children's literature because there's so much more new things out that you know 
 I'd pull out the classics once in a while for my kids 
 but there's such cute things out for kids 
 I know 
 And I just go to the library because they're expensive
 I mean it 
 and they go through them so fast you know 
 So I really have been going to the library and getting my ten books out 
 and they just love to sit and read 
 And now finally the littlest one is oldest to sit you know and watch the pictures instead of grabbing it and trying to rip the pages out
 So that has been fun to do that you know go through the children's literature and 
 Uh-huh 
 wonderful 
 Gosh 
 Really 
 Well I'm going to have to look for those 
 Yeah
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
