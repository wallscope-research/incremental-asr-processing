 No 
 But my grandparents were looking into it before 
 so I know what they've said
 Uh-huh
 they thought it was too much of a bother 
 Right 
 If they're equipped to handle the kind of patients you're going to have you know put in there too 
 Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still
 They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her 
 but they wanted to be independent as well Have their own room
 Uh-huh
 Well a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help
 They need health care 
 so they're already ill before they go
 That's probably a large factor 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right 
 That's what my grandparents 
 it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them
 So that was their thinking 
 Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency
 And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make So they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time 
 I guess that's a problem too for people Wait lists and all
 That 
 you can't always get in when you want too 
 and of course you can't just sit around and wait
 Yeah 
 And the money is also another issue How you're going to pay for it
 At that stage of life you only have so much money left 
 and I guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings
 I mean it is kind of fair 
 but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise
 So it's another problem
 Right 
 right 
 So it's just so complicated anymore I think 
 People outlive their savings 
 And with medicine being the way it is you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down 
 and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore
 It's just a shame that's the way it has to be 
 I think the retirement home idea's a nice idea To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay 
 and cause like if your spouse died all alone it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you To have friends
