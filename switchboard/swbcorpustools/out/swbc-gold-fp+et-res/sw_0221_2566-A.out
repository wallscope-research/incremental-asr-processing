 Okay 
 Do you have any children
 You don't
 Yes 
 I have one A five year old daughter
 Yes 
 I do 
 She was at a private well 
 I stayed off work with her for little over of a year when she was born 
 And then I had her at a private sitter for I guess two two and a half years after that
 she was referred to me by a couple of people 
 and she turned out to be wonderful 
 I couldn't have asked for anything better I don't think
 I didn't want to send her straight to a day care
 And even though she was that old I still didn't want her to go to a day care
 And this lady you would think it was her own
 Yeah 
 She's real good
 Yes 
 It is 
 And now I have got her in a Montessori school
 And she's really really doing good and learning a lot 
 And actually I've started working up there in the afternoons too 
 So 
 Y- 
 well yeah 
 I guess I'm going to quit as soon as the school season's over 
 But I really enjoyed being with her up there 
 I hate it for her 
 she has to stay that much longer
 but 
 Yeah 
 they go year-round teach them 
 Now in the summer they have like a lot of field trips
 There's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one and stuff like that 
 It's a lot more lax 
 but they still go through all their curriculum as usual
 gosh 
 I ca- 
 my husband and I both went 
 We kind of give her the third degree 
 Yeah 
 Well we went over to her house 
 so we told her you know pro- 
 well we just told here we'd be over that day 
 We didn't tell her when 
 So that way I didn't think you know } the house would be you know cleaned or anything for me specifically
 And she had a daughter 
 and I want to say her daughter was like six or seven right around first second grade 
 And at the time she kept one other child about a four year old I believe 
 But it was only like a part-time basis 
 So we went over there 
 and we questioned her about what she fed them and what she did with them during the day and you know just how she treated them how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and stuff like that 
 And we really seem to be pleased with her 
 And 
 Yes 
 yes 
 And she still loves her to death 
 I mean when they see each other you know they just love each other to death 
 And she literally spent almost the entire amount that I paid her on my daughter Either making her clothes or buying her things
 So we're real real lucky 
 But aft- 
 so she stayed with her about roughly two years 
 and she had to go back to work 
 they had some other expenses that came up 
 so she had to go I guess get a real job 
 Yeah 
 So 
 Well I checked a lot of places out you know the Kinder Cares and the stuff like that 
 And I live in Garland
 And there's this Montessori school that's nearby 
 and it had been recommended by some friends of ours 
 but it's an older place 
 And so I checked out all the new places that were near us 
 and then I checked that place out 
 and even though it was older it was real comfortable and I guess kind of homey
 And they didn't just play all day long You know 
 like I noticed a lot of these other schools that I went <> and or interviewed at they did a lot of play work and stuff 
 And then they 
 almost all of them had a Montessori section
 And I thought well gosh that must be pretty good you know if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into their school 
 And they made sure they pointed it out you know 
 But after I looked at this place and I took Randi with me I think just about to every place 
 One place I think I didn't take her
 And I just kind of let her go see what she felt like doing
 And that place boy 
 if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them it's hard to drag her away 
 So I felt more comfortable at that place
 Yeah
 And she was real comfortable 
 And she has really done good 
 I 
 it's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her
 But she seems to me to be you know pretty quick and smart 
 and she's already reading and writing and stuff like that 
 And she just turned five last month
 So 
 Yeah 
 I think so 
 I mean I didn't want to rush school at her the whole time 
 but Exactly 
 Exact- 
 I wanted to quit my job so I could stay home with her the next five months because I know she's going to have to face that 
 And my God Here we go you know 
 I just hate that 
 but anyway So you don't have any children 
 Do you have any nieces or nephews then 
 really <> Oh 
 really 
 Just easy to get them there and stu- 
 Well that's a shame
 really 
 That's scary 
 Yeah 
 I was petrified
 I mean that's 
 I don't know 
 that's just it 
 And that's why I don't mind paying more
 I don't know 
 I just feel m- 
 Yes 
 And that's one reason I like working up there a little bit is because I know what's really going on
 Because you don't know 
 because like at her school as soon as you drive up it's got like a circular type drive 
 They sit 
 and they have car callers 
 and some kid goes out and gets the kid 
 and it's time to go 
 Well at first that always kind of bothered me 
 I mean not bothered me 
 but I thought well you know I'd like to see what she's doing you know 
 But now that I'm there I mean it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that doddle You know when their parents come
 and it's hard to get them out 
 and a lot of parents have places to go and things like that 
 And it's late at night 
 so you know now it doesn't bother me at all 
 but 
 Yeah 
 Sixty-six 
 That one that's set back in the woods
 Yeah
 That's it 
 Yeah 
 Right
 Right 
 It w- 
 and that's something I like too
 because a lot of those places are like you know the one over here on seventy-eight Skaggs
 That little Kinder Care whatever it is
 You know it's right there on 
 which this is on a highway too 
 But it's set back enough to 
 I would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out 
 or if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could you know go in and get one
 Yeah 
 And that was one of the places I had checked out 
 And it was brand new when I checked it out 
 and of course it was beautiful and clean and smelled wonderful in there 
 but you know I that 
 I didn't base everything on that
 That's right 
 That's exactly right 
 You get some kids in there 
 and it's over quick
 But I've been real pleased knock on wood 
 I'm scared to death her going to public school
 I don't know 
 I w- 
 I do know why because you know drugs and everything else 
 and they talk about how soon they start that 
 and that scares me
 I mean you're just with them 
 Yeah 
 they've had police officers come in and talk to them about it 
 But of course they still have no concept of what in the world drugs are you know 
 but 
 Right 
 But I just think of her you know 
 next year she's going to be five six years old in kindergarten in same school with you know I guess ten year olds 
 Isn't that sixth grade you know 
 and that's a big gap
 And that I can honestly see the peer pressure there
 And that just terrifies me to death And stuff 
 those kids getting snatched 
 and I'm probably a little too over protective 
 but Well nowadays you have to be
 If 
 So I at first thought you know when I didn't have kids 
 I was going God how can you be so protective <> You know 
 but it's easy now 
 Yeah 
 Definitely
 That's exactly right 
 and I do
 But anyway 
 Well are you married 
 Are y'all planning on having kids 
 Or 
 Well that's good
 Because they're really neat 
 It's just
