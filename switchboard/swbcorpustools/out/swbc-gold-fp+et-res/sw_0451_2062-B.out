 Well personally you know I think you know 
 of course I'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package 
 and I think that we've probably got one of the best around you know 
 besides they tend to offer adequate vacation I guess 
 And the paid time off is wonderful 
 and one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered 
 and I think that is just a fabulous one 
 so I don't know if you participate in that or not 
 but 
 isn't it great 
 it's just a miracle how fast that adds up you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I had never really thought of it that way 
 but I guess that's true 
 I'm still young enough that the vacation's real important to me 
 and the paid time off is real important to me and that kind of thing 
 But you know as a matter of fact I just celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and kind of started looking through the book because of that you know 
 now that I'm a hundred percent vested you know you kind of look through the book and see well what does that mean and what is the pension all about 
 and you know when you're you know in your 
 I'm only in my late twenties now 
 so you tend not to think about retirement 
 But it's 
 I guess now is the time to think about it 
 so Does T I have a pretty good retirement package do you think
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 It's not going to build up quite enough 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 Well they seem to make it so easy to save 
 You know one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world 
 but I've got money coming out to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check 
 And it's probably not a great investment 
 but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway you know 
 I kind of have to trade off you know 
 If you never see it you don't spend it 
 And it's 
 Yeah
 Do you 
 Yeah
 Do you really not
 I debate about whether it's really good or not you know
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 That's very true
 We went and did a thing through I B S which is like a financial consultant type thing here in Dallas 
 and one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was you know 
 they work up this whole big you know profile for you all the things that you need to work on and you need to do 
 And then one of the things that we talked about with her was you know the need to save for our son's education 
 We have a two year old you know 
 and you know we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen you know 
 we have to do that now 
 and they have a way that they can figure you know what you know 
 and he's two now 
 in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college this is how much it'll cost you know 
 and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to 
 what it costs now is ridiculous 
 what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary 
 And they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a you know six percent interest rate to be able to have you know money for his college 
 And that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is you know about fifteen hundred dollars a year 
 So I guess it you know 
 in that way at least we know that that's taken care of you know 
 we can worry about other things 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Is it really 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 That's right 
 Well that's what she said to us 
 She said now do you all want him to go to a state college or a private college 
 and our answer was that you know we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college 
 And if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship to attend you know 
 And that was kind of our view on it 
 It just costs too much 
 you just can't do it you know 
 So I don't know 
 it's 
 I don't 
 it just amazing 
 it amazes me how much the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years 
 I just don't know how anybody's going to do it
 goodness
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Exactly
 Exactly
 That's right
 That's right 
 Well you know you know T I offers some good stuff 
 and then I mean I think there's some negatives 
 but there's going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go 
 I have you know all 
 this is the first really large company I've worked for I've 
 always been involved in little small you know privately owned firms 
 and so I've never had the big benefit package 
 So I really don't know how to compare it to other big companies you know 
 when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what they offered 
 So I've been real pleased
 Yeah
 Think so
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and you can pick what you want 
 and yeah
 Right
 That sounds really good 
 I read a thing 
 I don't even remember if it was in the DALLASITE or the INSITE one about companies allowing you 
 and they said that T I was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days Which I thought sounded like a good idea 
 You know if you've been there you know under five years you get two weeks of vacation 
 but that's really not enough 
 and you want an extra week then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay I'm going to want an extra five days this year 
 and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck you know 
 and they're deducting it all along 
 so you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time you know 
 you're really not being paid for them 
 the money is actually coming out of your own pocket 
 but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once you know 
 So that is kind of an idea that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in 
 and T I said that they were looking into something like that 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well 
 true
 True
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well 
 and yeah 
 and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person 
 and you know I see a lot of differences from one group to the next you know about who gets it and who doesn't get it you know 
 and that's that way with a lot of things you know there 
 It seems like it depends on what group you happen to be in what you're going to get and what you're not going to get 
 so 
 Which is the same 
 but then it's probably that way anywhere you know 
 that's 
 Uh-huh
