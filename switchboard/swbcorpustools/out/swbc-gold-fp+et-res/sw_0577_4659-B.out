 Well I can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago because I'm not that old yet
 
 I know that 
 I mean obviously you look at the technological aspect of social change 
 I mean you didn't have video games 
 You didn't have home computers 
 You didn't have Xerox machines
 I mean you try to 
 you go into a business today 
 and you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper 
 and it's almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines and everything have become such a part of the way we live
 And 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 a business associate of mine was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail 
 and you had to do something 
 this was concerning the S E C 
 and so if they had business to do they had to finish it you know three days in advance so they could get it through the mail
 And now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute *[[slash error]] Because you can get it there you know *[["Because" as connector; sd]] in a matter of minutes you know through a fax machine 
 and because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder
 Because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well there's that 
 and there's the fact that you know nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen 
 I mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I saw the numbers on that awhile back 
 and I was like uh-huh 
 so <> 
 Well In terms of the long term effect on America in terms of the culture and everything I don't know 
 or an extremely large part of the next generation is going to be you know second generation from immigrant parents
 And they're going to be really struggling 
 and I don't think that America is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good 
 I mean it's no longer the accomplishment that it once was 
 and not that many people are really trying I don't think 
 Yeah <>
 Yeah 
 tha-
