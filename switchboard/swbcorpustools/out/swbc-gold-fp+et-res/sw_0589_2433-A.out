 Well ironically enough I'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because I resumed an aerobics class the night before last
 I ripped the ligaments in my right ankle
 Yeah 
 so 
 That's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way you know down the hallway 
 Do you do anything on a regular basis
 Yeah 
 that's a good 
 yeah 
 My husband's a T Ier in the unit here
 Do you when you go to the 
 I have to ask you 
 and if this is getting to 
 we're not supposed to get too particular 
 but I'm just curious 
 when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek in terms of it's so much of a weight orientation weight lifting et cetera
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well it's not that great 
 and I go to the Spring Creek one on and off 
 But my husband's working over there 
 and he just goes to the Dallas one 
 But I just don't 
 I mean it's just so much weight lifting 
 Even the Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it
 Or is that what your into 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there
 And the pool when it gets warmer
 Yeah 
 I know 
 Well what I did was I went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas 
 and long story short I hadn't 
 this is really a stupid thing that happened 
 but they have like the gymnasium flooring 
 and then like they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where I usually stand in any class like that I go to 
 Instead of having that level you know they had a chrome strip that wasn't level 
 and it was about four inches deep and then about oh a seventy degree angle
 And as we were jumping around or doing something I just jumped up and came right down on it
 The orthopedist called it a basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you and it snapped
 I know 
 We went to well whatever in Plano 
 and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show 
 And the doctor said you didn't do anything 
 There's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you 
 That was Tuesday night 
 and Wednesday night the radiologist called me at work 
 and I was on crutches 
 and he said I think you better call an orthopedist 
 So we went to one 
 and he just put a big old cast on it
 Yeah 
 for about four weeks
 Well I like aerobics 
 but I'm not so sure that 
 No 
 I've never 
 I was off for about six months too just for some other surgery I'd had 
 but you know I was pretty much in shape walking 
 and you know this is one of those things 
 like this orthopedist said he said you'd be surprised how many people come in here with things like that because they are active
 You know I was real embarrassed 
 but I felt kind of stupid 
 Yeah 
 they do 
 I mean I guess I'm glad you know that nobody really noticed 
 I guess you could say
 Because I got up and started jumping on it again
 Yeah 
 really 
 I enjoy aerobics 
 and I do it because I like it 
 I mean I like the music and that kind of stuff
 Oh
 that makes my foot 
 how'd you do that 
 In aerobics
 goodness
 Uh-huh
 What'd they do for that 
 Did they have to cast it
 so the impact would not be good
 goodness
 Uh-huh
 that makes sense 
 So I mean are you in terms of other things like not running but playing a little bit of tennis can you not do stuff like that at all
 Yeah 
 It's been 
 That's probably the safer way 
 because I notice in aerobics a lot of the women that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things
 I'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coronary 
 And there was my ego when I went ahead 
 and I went I can do that 
 and half the time though I don't jump half as much as 
 I mean like I'm real tall 
 and you know I'm not heavy 
 but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height I'm five eleven you need just take it easy
 but when I see some wo- 
 I mean and I just don't think it's healthy 
 all that pounding all the time
 So yeah 
 that's the other reason 
 and I don't know 
 this was just I guess something freak that happened to me 
 because I wasn't familiar with the 
 it was completely 
 I mean it literally 
 the two dissimilar floor coverings were not level 
 And at first after it happened I thought maybe that's a handicap access 
 and then I said no
 that's just the way it's constructed
 And my husband being a T I engineer 
 I said a few things to him when I got home 
 I said who has engineered that 
 But I 
 sounds you like 
 one thing that I like like swimming you like that a lot
 Do you like that what that voice said 
 *[[one utt with utt2]] do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to
 That's how I am 
 Yeah 
 If I don't do it I just feel like I don't have as much energy
 Right 
 It curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff
 Yeah 
 but 
 That gravity factor 
 I know 
 Like that orthopedist said to me he said don't worry Diane 
 he said you're at thirty something 
 but you're on the upper side 
 He said that don't worry 
 he says even if you weren't doing anything that would start to happen to you
 Yeah 
 because I said I'm not that heavy 
 I'm not heavy you know 
 maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being
 I said why do I feel like I need to start pushing myself more 
 And he goes human nature 
 And then you know you see these little girls in these little bitty things 
 and they're all like twenty-one years of age 
 But luckily at there's a little more diverse clientele
 Except for the guys that lift the weights 
 They do intimidate
 Yeah 
 There some things I'd like to try 
 but you know sometime when I ask I just feel like boy am I stupid or what
 Uh-huh
 I think I've 
 there was some girl there 
 I've been there like maybe a dozen times
 But I actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to
 It's terrible 
 I don't know if the Dallas location 
 it just seems that 
 sometimes I feel like I'm in a singles bar 
 No 
 I haven't either 
 and I just 
 it's not that far of a drive 
 and I'm glad they did that 
 you're not missing anything at the Dallas renovated site 
 It's not at all anything worth talking about
 Yeah 
 but if you don't live near there that's not worth 
 Yeah 
 That's actually where this happened to me out in I say Plano 
 but it's all the same to me 
 Richardson over on Campbell and Park Hill there's a new recreation center
 And as we were doing it too everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities 
 walked out 
 I was one thing 
 great I have purple tights on you know
 And they're going yes 
 But in general I like dance a lot 
 so I mean aerobics is something I'd hate to give up 
 But he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot 
 but he just said to me maybe you ought to try bicycling 
 or 
 He told me eight to twelve weeks
 Not anything you know 
 I said but you're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks 
 He said yeah 
 but that's just 
 they tried to put me in some kind of immobilized walker because he doesn't like to put casts on when it's warm 
 But I just 
 the more they tried to get my foot in the more I screamed 
 I couldn't you know adjust that 
 You know more about this stuff than I do obviously then 
 No 
 Well you're walking okay now obviously 
 and you can 
 Well anything else about exercise we can talk about
 Yeah 
 me too 
 me too 
 I need to go actually get something to eat here
 Okay 
 thank you Sandy
 Uh-huh 
 Bye-bye
