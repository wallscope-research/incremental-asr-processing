 Okay 
 the topic was should the United States adopt the metric system and if so should 
 And why didn't it work last time 
 Yeah 
 well I am too 
 I wish it had started a long time ago is the problem because we're so wound up in the system that we've got that you know trying to convert over 
 and I guess they tried what'd the call it soft conversion and hard conversion 
 one of them is where you just take whatever's already standard 
 and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter
 I don't know 
 Well doesn't just about everything now have both metric and English
 yeah 
 yeah
 I kind of remember back when gas prices started up you know pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range 
 somebody had 
 I believe it was Exxon
 we were living in Lubbock at the time 
 they started marketing it in liters 
 and it was only like twenty-nine and thirty cents a liter 
 So they could put this sign out front that said you know thirty-nine cents a liter
 And nobody had any idea what a liter was 
 so 
 When we finally out that liters was about a quart there's about four liters in a gallon 
 so you can figure out what you're actually paying for it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Oh
 I think maybe there's where the problem came in you know 
 We've tried to instead of learning 
 it's kind of like learning a language you know 
 when you learn one from the other you always end up in this conversion thing all the time
 So you 
 it's almost like 
 course this country isn't a dictatorship 
 but you know it's like somebody said okay as of such and such a date you know anybody caught talking in the English you know will be shot or something like that you know 
 But 
 Yeah 
 I read that what Uganda and 
 There's one or two others that just 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah I do too
 And one of the things that we've run into a problem 
 course you're familiar with any drawing system you end up with things in parts of inches you know half fourth you know this sort of thing
 And then you end up with a decimal where you start getting into mils and that sort of thing
 And then some of them are done in you know purely metric
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I can imagine
 the one that 
 have you ever lived in a country where they use metric
 I was with T I in El Salvador for a while 
 and I had to get used to you know purely metric system down there because they didn't understand anything else 
 You know if you start talking about miles they'd look at you like what
 So I had a little bit of experience with it 
 and also I noticed in Canada you drop a quarter fifty cents whatever in a coke machine up there 
 and you get this funny looking coke you know 
 it's in a can that's taller but not as big around
 You know I guess that's some 
 it's not a liter 
 it's like a half a liter or something like that 
 It's a strange looking can 
 But my daughter in law's from Panama 
 and they have had Americans down there for so long you know that they're kind of into both systems 
 but she gets real confused on distances 
 and temperature is the big thing the Centigrade for which she says Celsius
 Well I had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature you know 
 if it's between zero and ten it's cold 
 and if it's ten and twenty it's not too bad 
 if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm
 if it's more than thirty it's just hotter than all get out 
 but The big problem is not having the resolution you know between a hundred if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what thirty zero you know thirty four degrees whatever that is 
 You know you don't get all the little differences
 you know the differences between seventy and seventy-two or seventy-five degrees isn't much 
 but the difference thirty and thirty-five degrees is quite a bit
 Yeah 
 five 
 Yeah 
 something like that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Though we call it the English system 
 but I'm not sure what they do in England now 
 they're on metric aren't they
 Yeah 
 except they've got a 
 now okay we run into some problems once 
 I remember they've got a nut and bolts system called Wentworth 
 And this thing was even different than you know S A E standards and stuff 
 So 
 this ca- 
 okay 
 my dad bought one of these little Nash Metropolitans here quite a few years back 
 and the thing had a Austin Heeley type engine you know 
 it was Austin motors engine and running gear
 And the body was built by Nash 
 or who you know 
 that was even before American Motors 
 but Nash essentially in the U S somewhere 
 And that thing had the darndest combination of metric and Wentworth and S A E 
 He ended up with about three sets of tools in order to work on that fool thing 
 Because I think the Wentworth and the S A E bolt sizes were the same 
 but the threads were different 
 and it was a total mess 
 And on my Chevy van that's a couple of years old 
 Part of it's built in Canada 
 Matter of fact the thing is I always say it's built off shore you know because it was assembled in Canada 
 The only thing that was in it built in the U S was the differential 
 and it was built in Buffalo New York 
 But it's got the hardest combination of metric 
 and most of the body parts seem to be metric 
 and most of the engine parts seem to be S A E 
 so It's just crazy
 Yeah
 I thought maybe they would convert to metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit because what is it fifty-six or fifty-seven's a hundred kilometers 
 and you know 
 yeah 
 you'd have 
 hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five 
 you'd have people going you're right a hundred miles an hour
 And so I don't know 
 I'd kind of 
 and the other thing too is you know between here and El Paso's what five hundred miles 
 but it's almost eight hundred kilometers you know 
 That'd sure seems like a long way
 Yeah 
 I guess that's it
 Well they converted all the road signs to fifty-five miles an hour you know 
 they could've converted it to metric just about as easy
 Yeah
 Not all that common
 I know the only other place that I was ever at where they really had it mixed was in Panama where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in miles per hour 
 and some are in kilometers 
 And you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour
