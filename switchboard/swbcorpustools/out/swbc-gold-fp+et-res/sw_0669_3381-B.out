 gracious
 Uh-huh 
 Wasn't it your state that had the guy that committed all those murders 
 There was that 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that was really on the national news a lot 
 We heard a lot about that in Texas
 Oh
 Well I can imagine
 It seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me 
 I don't know 
 I don't know if statistically they are 
 but it seems like maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news 
 I don't know
 You wonder about that sometimes
 Uh-huh 
 That's kind of scary 
 I wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these way out stories 
 Maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas
 Yes 
 we do
 Do you have it up there
 I see
 Do you think that's a deterrent
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 I guess that's another thing that to me is a real problem 
 and I know we have got so many people in our system now at least here in Texas
 I mean they are really in a crisis 
 There has been times they have had to just close off the prisons and leave them in county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them
 And a lot of them they put out on parole 
 and then some of the ones that they put out early you know do repeat offenses 
 and the crime rate is the worst than ever before
 I think that could be true too
 I think the whole parole thing you know if somebody is convicted of second-degree murder or something gets fifteen years well they are out in six or seven You know outbound on the streets again 
 And to me that's really scary 
 Some of these crimes that they commit you know seems like the punishment is not really equal to the crime
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 They think it's okay thing to do
 Yeah 
 I think that's a very good point 
 You know I 
 there's a lot more working mothers a lot more kids in day care centers all that kind of thing 
 Morality is being taught more by the schools a lot of times than in the home anymore 
 And 
 Uh-huh
