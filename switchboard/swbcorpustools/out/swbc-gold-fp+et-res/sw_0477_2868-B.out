 no 
 I've only been here for the last ten years 
 I grew up most of my childhood in Germany
 and 
 we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance
 So we travelled all over Europe when I was very young Unfortunately a little bit too young to really appreciate
 I was grade school age 
 
 that would be to me a really nice vacation because I'm not in physical shape for something like that but I sure would work on it if I had an opportunity like that
 well my husband and I are scuba divers
 So we both like to go to dive resorts 
 we went to Hawaii on our honeymoon
 and we dove there 
 but we did about six dives while we were there 
 And we were originally planning on going to Cayman last year
 but we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip 
 We had to have like eleven people for this package deal
 and we couldn't get enough people together to go 
 so it ended up falling through 
 We were going to get a really good price
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Snorkeling 
 really
 
 Well my husband and I both like water
 so any vacation that we go on is usually close to the ocean or something like that
 Yeah 
 After we moved away from Germany we moved to New Hampshire
 And I lived there for seven years
 and I really enjoyed that because you know the mountains were real close
 we like the white mountains 
 and unfortunately I didn't really get to go skiing much while I was there 
 I went skiing once
 Uh-huh 
 
 not really so much 
 if there was some place that we went to where there was hiking involved I would be you know happy to go hiking
 but we never have really planned a vacation around places to go hiking
 Yeah 
 Our next vacation will be scuba diving 
 I'm sure
 No 
 not yet
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 it's a little more difficult planning a vacation when you have children
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 and diving is something that 
 especially for small children 
 I think the minimum age for diving legal anyway would be probably about sixteen 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 that sounds like a lot of fun
 Our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that too
 that there were several hundred people 
 and they all kind of met at a central place 
 I didn't go
 but It would have been a nice vacation
 Uh-huh 
 or something like the Volkswagen Vanagon I've heard is really nice
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 My dad has been talking for years about getting a fifth wheel and just picking up 
 he's retired
 he's in his sixties 
 and he would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there and just you know not be settled anywhere
 just see see the rest of the country
 Uh-huh
 he does that quite a bit
 he hasn't lately though because he's been ill
 but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time 
 and you know he'll say this is my itinerary 
 I'm going here here and here 
 and I'll be back in about two months 
 Uh-huh 
 Have you been to a lot of the different historical sites
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I think right now while my husband and I don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and adventurous types of things
 and then eventually when we have kids 
 Now his folks did a lot of traveling across country 
 You know they went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I do enjoy camping
 As long as I have a shower nearby I'm fine And electricity
 Yeah
 It was nice talking to you too Beth
 Okay 
 Bye-bye
