 Sounds 
 But I gather you do not separate the bottles and cans
 Uh-huh 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 I know 
 Not only have I come to Washington but I find it very amusing that the thing that was just instituted here is very similar 
 That is we also have blue bins 
 We also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and landfill space is in deed the driving factor here 
 And in fact despite all of our open space out here landfill space is still very hard to come by
 A- 
 Ah 
 but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will
 Well 
 Yes 
 other than nuking it
 in fact Los Alamos has done a fair amount of research in recycling things in general 
 it involves for instance creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium and barium and other things from waste material in general and purify the waste of specific nasty elements
 And the thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody made some special polymers that have the ability to make certain actinide elements adhere to them
 they've looked at plutonium and uranium and some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste 
 and again this is driven by all of the documentation and E S and H considerations that people are worrying about I think much more than they should 
 Actually I've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable 
 Back when I was in graduate school I did all of the recycling of the paper from the computer center 
 and in fact I think I was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recycled paper 
 I think that's a wonderful idea
 The only alternative I would see is and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill 
 and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more
 and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight
