 Well I personally don't have any problem with drug testing employees or potential employees do you
 I mean basically
 Okay 
 I don't 
 I really can't disagree with it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I think that's really the only fair way to do it
 I really think it ought to be s- 
 you know Junkins all the way down
 Right 
 as a matter of fact I want to think they took the top managers first 
 isn't that a fact 
 I've been retired from T I about a year
 but the program you know was still fairly new 
 I guess it had been going on maybe almost a year before I retired 
 so I was not ever called upon to do a drug test 
 I certainly wouldn't object to it 
 and I think random is probably you know the only really fair way to do it
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 I 
 absolutely 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 I don't think they'll have much choice do you
 Especially if they have anything do with you know government contracts or anything 
 As matter of fact I want to believe that the defense department more or less mandated that people you know who work on defense contracts you know do some sort of you know drug testing 
 I think that's really what maybe prompted T I to do it 
 I was in the Defense Electronic Division when I retired 
 I know you know it was a real hot hot item there 
 I want to think maybe they you know really got some nudging from you know D O D to do this sort of thing
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 So you know the atmosphere then
 So yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 I agree 
 I 
 That's right 
 That's r- 
 absolutely 
 Yeah 
 I d- 
 I just can't disagree with you with you know the basic premise
 It's to m- 
 as far as I know it's you know seems to be a fairly accurate program as far as you know the testing goes 
 And 
 That's right 
 That's right 
 And offer you you know help if you need help
 Yeah 
 I do too Put you out on the street 
 Yeah
 That's right
 No 
 ab- 
 That's right
 absolutely 
 Not to mention alcohol
 Yep 
 yep 
 Uh-huh 
 That's right 
 That's right 
 gosh 
 Well it's a real problem 
 I'm sure 
 I'm sure
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 right
 Yeah 
 I know a lot of people who when it first be- 
 or at least began was in the talking sta- 
 you know everybody knew it was coming 
 it just a matter of time everybody was screaming you know invasion of privacy and all this stuff 
 But a lot of people I think after they thought about it for awhile and you know weighed the pros and cons decided you know it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs of course
 That's right 
 Uh-huh 
 That's right 
 yep 
 yep 
 That's right 
 Or yourself 
 or 
 Yeah 
 That's right
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 That's true
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 assembly people
 That's right
 That's r- 
 absolutely
 Uh-huh 
 absolutely 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Sure 
 right 
 Uh-huh 
 Sure 
 trickles up and down
 Sure does
 Yeah 
 affects a lot of people
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 I think they probably will 
 You know if they 
 I'm sure it's a very expensive program to administer 
 I'm not sure every small company could do it
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 it's got to help them too
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I do too 
 that's right 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 No 
 no 
 But it'll save in some areas 
 yeah 
 right
 That's right 
 That certainly could happen 
 That's a very very very competitive business
 Yeah 
 I do too 
 I just really can't disagree with you
 Okay 
 well it's nice to talk to you
 And you take care
 Okay 
 Bye-bye
