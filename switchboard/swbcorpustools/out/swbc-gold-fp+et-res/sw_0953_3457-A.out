 Okay 
 let me see I've got two children 
 One is 
 both preschoolers 
 one is two 
 and one is four
 and this is my first year off 
 and I've always worked from the time that they were little 
 and so I decided to hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and spend some more time with them which I hadn't been doing
 So 
 Oh
 Oh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well that's what I was doing before 
 I was teaching for Richardson School District
 And it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little
 And it's really hard
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's right 
 that's right 
 And that's what was kind of where we were you know 
 I really didn't have to work 
 but I felt like I really wanted to work
 And I also felt like boy I was sure missing a lot 
 and they were growing so fast 
 and you know it's like do I really need to work you know
 and that choice was there 
 I really didn't have to 
 and you know so I did have that advantage there 
 but it's different staying home too you know
 It's an adjustment to make also
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Wow that's great
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Wow that's great
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 kind of goes on
 They do what they see you know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 Plus you teach middle school 
 so I'm sure that 
 you really 
 boy boy 
 I taught early childhood
 so I had the little ones
 And you know I saw it there too 
 and it's kind of an eye-opener
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think you're right
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah
 I agree 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I agree 
 I know exactly what you're saying
