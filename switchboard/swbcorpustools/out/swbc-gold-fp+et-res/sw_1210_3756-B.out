 Yes 
 I have 
 That room I showed you
 And then since then we have painted the bedroom
 Yeah 
 I showed you that one too didn't I 
 The brown one 
 Yeah 
 the one that looks like a fudgesicle
 Yeah
 Yeah
 yeah
 Well that is hard 
 Now I asked Janice or somebody recently how you do that when you paint the ceilings you know where you have got that textured stuff that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry that you paint that with 
 How do you get the edge
 You just have to be real careful
 We use a two inch brush on a slant
 and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes 
 But 
 Well yeah 
 I think I am going to do it this spring actually
 Yeah 
 there are six houses 
 See the people that own the house they pay for anything like that that we do As far as the materials 
 There are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses
 So I am thinking I am going to change it to something you know 
 the brick is multi color Mostly earth tones 
 I think I am going to put something like a brown on it on the outside And maybe a little deeper brown in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little What color did you paint 
 Yeah
 There are some columns that could be painted a different color too 
 What color did you paint your house
 On the out 
 Well you have got to get one of those ladders
 yeah
 A friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he has done his house 
 and that is what he 
 I was out there last week 
 and he has finished everything except the chimney
 Yeah
 Well our house in New Mexico it was stucco 
 but we had all this trim to paint and lots of it
 And we did basically seventy-five percent of the house 
 and then I was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff
 So I hired this man to come in and do it A young kid
 And he came with his own raf- 
 what do you call those things
 No 
 those where you built like a rafter thing
 Yeah 
 Scaffold
 He came and did it that way 
 and I think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up
 And literally I wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that I had left for him were above huge humongous cactus
 and if he fell he was dead 
 and he knew that 
 So 
 Yeah
 Plus he cleaned up my mess
 Uh-huh
 How much did it cost you for the paint for the outside
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 But that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went I guess to buy his paint
 and yet he bought like seventeen gallons
 And anyway when he checked out and he was using his charge card too They only charged him for one gallon of paint Like thirteen bucks or something
 And he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that 
 and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint
 so she had to start all over again
 and when he got outside he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety-nine or something
 And he saw 
 Yeah 
 it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff
 Yeah
 Rollers are so messy 
 We never any more
 Well a little paintbrush
