 Drug testing in the work place 
 I've been tested a few times just before employment 
 But that's about it 
 I've never had random drug testing
 really
 Uh-huh
 they do with alcohol 
 They do it with alcohol
 I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine
 That's interesting
 What type of field of work are you in
 in the oil business
 Okay 
 and you work in the office around
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 see I work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars 
 and we work around a lot of explosives
 Yeah 
 so that's you know 
 I'm all for it because well the type of environment I work in you know they're working with explosives 
 and so they could blow up the whole 
 well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use 
 but still it can be dangerous
 Yeah
 Now do they fire them or do they 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 wow
 that's 
 I think our policy is that 
 all right it's probably the same thing 
 I'm not really sure what the 
 That's right 
 But I know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance 
 but I'm not sure if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in
 Uh-huh
 do you think it limits 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 You could time it just right
 I know one employee 
 I know when I was working with he had alcohol on his breath 
 and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not 
 That'd be just as dangerous
 That's true
 Uh-huh 
 Do they give any limits on alcohol 
 or is it 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
