 Do you know anyone that is in a nursing home or has ever been in one
 Uh-huh
 Well I'm trying to think 
 My wife's grandmother had Alzheimer's 
 and they were going to put her into a nursing home 
 and when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble 
 and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a nuisance Or worse than a nuisance 
 I mean she sort of went you know bananas 
 and they couldn't deal with her 
 So I guess you need to know whether it's you know a no deposit no return kind of thing whether 
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 My grandmother actually was in a nursing home that 
 there was a retirement hotel and then a 
 there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it 
 so for the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes But could also go and eat someplace else
 And then as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to provide full-time care 
 and she didn't have to do anything anymore 
 But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly 
 And that's som- 
 I don't know whether that's because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the reason is 
 But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are 
 Then you only go there as a last resort
 Or people send you there as a last resort
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 I guess 
 Right 
 When you need it you need it I guess
 Right
 Yeah 
 Sure
 And if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price
 Yeah 
 Well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing
 Yeah 
 Right
 Yeah 
 I've known quite a few people that have gone to retirement communities 
 I don't know if they have them back there 
 but here in California and in Ari-
