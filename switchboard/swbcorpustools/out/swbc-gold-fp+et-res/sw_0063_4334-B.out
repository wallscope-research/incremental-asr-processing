 well I don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas 
 I know what's hot down here with me 
 so that's about all I can feel apt to discuss with you since I just know 
 I don't ever listen to the radio 
 and that's usually what's hot around here 
 So what kind of music do you like
 Folk music
 Uh-huh 
 Well we're on totally different wavelengths
 I'm more old rock and roll some newer I guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type you know Van Halen that kind of thing
 I don't listen to the radio at all 
 We live in a fairly small town 
 so classic rock for me is what I have which is like Doors Eagles Jimmy Hendrix
 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well they 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's something doesn't even sound good loud really You know
 You know definitely 
 so anything new you like coming out now other than folk music some I might know of 
 I don't know any folk music at all
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 here 
 plenty 
 way more than I can stand down here
 I don't care for it at all that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it 
 I 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's even more commercialized country music 
 But it's getting pretty big everywhere as I see it 
 Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses 
 so 
 Yeah 
 it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is 
 Concert tours for country and western sings it's quite odd 
 but I don't know 
 music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays I think 
 It's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music you know
 Yeah 
 and that's all it 
 Yeah
 That's what it 
 Yeah 
 that's what you say 
 and then music is wrapped around now 
 Now it's the other way around
 No 
 no 
 they don't have anything really important you want to hear 
 But you know it's kind of odd 
 it's like it doesn't have to be good 
 it's just who does it you know
 you hear a Paula Abdul song 
 and you 
 and I think if somebody else were to play that you know everybody would think that's lousy 
 but because she did it it's supposed to be good you know 
 it comes to the point where it's your name not what you do more than anything 
 Madonna can do anything 
 and it would be considered good because it's Madonna you know
 Madonna could start playing folk music 
 and folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it 
 so it's really backwards how things are working now 
 but 
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 So I don't think that's a good thing at all 
 but that's the point we've reached 
 so I don't know how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that's about how I am on popular music 
 I don't know enough about it because I just listen 
 everything I listen to is what I buy not whatever they play on the radio 
 so 
 I 
 yeah 
 I just mostly buy along the same lines all the time 
 I don't really switch around to new things very often
 you know it's way to hectic and too confusing
 
 yeah 
 generally 
 or about the only new music I hear is somebody else that I know will buy something new that I haven't heard 
 and I listen to it that way 
 but as far as 
 yeah 
 I don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless I've heard it
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's definitely 
 I
