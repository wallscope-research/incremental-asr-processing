 Hi 
 my name is Donna 
 and I'm calling from Plano Texas 
 okay 
 I find exercise kind of a task I guess I'd say 
 I go to aerobics two days a week 
 but I also have three kids at home 
 so they keep me pretty busy
 Yeah 
 that gives me plenty of exercise 
 but I enjoy walking outside and bicycling once in a while with the family 
 Excuse me <> 
 That's fine 
 And yourself
 Uh-huh 
 every morning 
 Well my husband swims every day at lunch which he loves doing
 yeah 
 he does it every day like a ritual 
 Once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if someone invites him to lunch he'll not go 
 but he goes every day 
 and then he's a runner too 
 He runs three mornings a week 
 he gets up about five and does his deal 
 and some days he doesn't 
 but then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run
 And we 
 Oh
 the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here 
 and I know do it to just keep the pounds off 
 We're getting up in age I guess in our late thirties 
 so we need to keep exercising just to be able to 
 I know
 Yeah 
 I go to this aerobics class two mornings a week 
 and I take my three year old with me 
 There's a nursery there 
 And it's kind of another day out for her to have little friends 
 and I enjoy the socialization of it you know 
 getting to see the same women every morning 
 but there are some parts during that exercise that I think I cannot do another second of this
 It is
 That's true 
 that's true
 Well
 Okay well
 Yes 
 thank you for participating
 Thank you 
 Bye
