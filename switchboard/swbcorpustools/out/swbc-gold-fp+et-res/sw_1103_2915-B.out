 Yeah
 Well I think they waste what we pay
 I think they waste all the money that we pay 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Now it's even higher in Dallas County 
 so 
 Was it 
 *[[listen]] It's eight and a quarter I think
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 because at some point it goes up to thirty-three percent 
 and then the people that make you know five hundred thousand dollars and higher than that they don't have to pay 
 and sometimes they have to pay even less taxes
 No 
 it isn't
 What
 Huh-uh
 Right
 I mean if they're in business and they're making money 
 I could see if they're losing money 
 but they're making money
 then they should pay taxes then
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 I just file federal income tax every year
 Yeah 
 I just got divorced 
 so I'm single again 
 and you know it's a lot worse for single people because they pay the same amount as the people that make the same amount of money and they're married 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Whoever works less they can get a tax credit for that
 If both of the spouses work then you get a tax credit for that
 Uh-huh
 Well it's two thousand now
 Yeah 
 for everybody
 Uh-huh
 Then you get a child care exemption 
 but it's not enough you know 
 I mean you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care
 and they only give you like I think it's about five or ten percent of that
 You know it's not even 
 okay 
 Nice talking to you
