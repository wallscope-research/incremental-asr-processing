 Okay 
 I guess my task 
 I usually ride my bike 
 I have a stationary bike and a regular bike 
 And when I can I like to ride my regular bike outside because it's so much nicer 
 The stationary bike is so boring 
 But I have head phones 
 plus I have it in the living room 
 so I either watch T V or we have a fish tank 
 so I watch the fish you know Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied 
 I like to have the T V on because that usually keeps me more occupied 
 It kind of takes the time away 
 and I don't realize that's really the only time I ever watch T V is when I'm on the bike 
 and then usually after I'm done riding the bike just to cool myself down I usually take a walk you know 
 and that just kind of gets me you know to where I'm not quite as tired I guess 
 But it's definitely a task
 I can't say that I really enjoy it 
 I wish that I did enjoy it more 
 but I do it because I have to not because I want to 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Really
 So is it just women that go there
 See I think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a health club 
 Because I don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise 
 You know so I have tried to just do stuff at home 
 and I just feel conscious about it 
 I mean I'm not big you know or anything 
 but I still don't like other people watching me
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 That's what 
 Really 
 that's great 
 How 
 Do they have a pool 
 or what is 
 
 I've heard that that's really good for you to do
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So you don't really feel like you're really working that hard do you
 When you're in the water
 wow 
 Well that's funny 
 I never would have thought of that
 Are they water shoes 
 Is that 
 okay 
 okay
 Okay 
 okay
 that's really funny 
 that's 
 So how often do find yourself going 
 if you're doing it on a regular basis how often do you go
 Yeah 
 That's really 
 Really
 I wish that I could make myself exercise every day 
 But I do force myself to do it at least three times a week Which I don't feel like is enough 
 but it's at least something 
 You know it 
 I have to force myself to do it like I said because to me I really don't enjoy it 
 But I know that I have to do it 
 I mean it's not a question of whether I want to you know
 But 
 Uh-huh
 that's 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Did you ever 
 Well I'm sorry 
 did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for T I 
 Did you ever try that 
 okay
 
 Then that would 
 yeah
 I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you wouldn't it
 Oh
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh
 Wow
 What if you're already on one 
 I mean 
 Yeah 
 I mean when you go in there they wouldn't make you do theirs Would they
 Okay
 But they have packages where they just offer the exercise program 
 Is that what you're saying
 I see 
 okay 
 
 
 Wow 
 That's 
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 That would be really nice 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So you really do enjoy your exercise then since your 
 Uh-huh 
 That's you know 
 I wanted to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike 
 but I got talked into the bike instead 
 And I don't know 
 I really wanted a stepper 
 I'm considering maybe even buying one of those too 
 But I'm not sure if I'll get benefit out of both of them 
 I mean I don't know if it would really do any good having both of them 
 Which one do you feel is better since you use them both
 Uh-huh
 
 Uh-huh
 really
 
 Uh-hum
 Uh-huh
