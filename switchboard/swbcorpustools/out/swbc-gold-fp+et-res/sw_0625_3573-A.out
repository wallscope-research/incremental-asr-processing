 Okay 
 well 
 All right well 
 tell me about the car that you've got
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's very interesting 
 I've had exactly the same experience with the one that I've got 
 It's a 
 and surprisingly it's also an eighty-four
 and 
 Yeah 
 I'm still here 
 I'm sorry what
 Yes 
 it's an L X 
 it's not a hatchback 
 but it's 
 Four door 
 yeah
 and very very comfortable car 
 Big roomy trunk
 and very happy with it 
 and I must admit it's you know 
 if 
 my only consideration were you know buying another car just to tool around town in and make you know brief trips and things like that 
 I would very seriously consider buying one 
 I think they're extraordinarily reliable cars
 my real concern with why I'm not sure I want to buy a Honda is because I have to make a kind of a steady trip down the road about once a month because I'm divorced 
 and I have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina
 and I drive down Interstate Ninety-five 
 and it's just an absolutely wild highway
 Yeah 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 And well you've got it 
 so having precious cargo in the car with me as you can well imagine it's very hard for me to imagine that a Honda's going to be as safe a car as the one that I've got my eye on which is a Volvo
 in fact quite frankly I've owned a Volvo in the past 
 and I've 
 they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service 
 but I've found that I've had a lot of luck with them 
 course I'm a mechanically inclined kind of person 
 and I always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that you know need to be taken care of and so forth 
 And I guess that's one thing that recommends the Honda to a lot of people is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood 
 and 
 I know 
 It's really amazing
 It's 
 Absolutely
 incredible 
 So yeah 
 anyway I've been looking at the prices of these cars and so forth 
 and I think that it's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to buy ones that are about the vintage of the cars that you and I currently own
 and 
 Well certainly some of the top end ones 
 You can still get even the low end wagons for less than twenty thousand dollars
 and we get you know 
 in the Washington area of course being as affluent as it is there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here
 so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any week 
 and I sort of you know scan the paper and look at them and so forth 
 anyway and that's the other thing is that I've never really been too terribly much of a new car person 
 I think I've bought one or two new cars in my life 
 and I've tended to buy cars that are you know two or three and sometimes even four and five or six years old 
 This Honda that I have I bought used 
 and in fact it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it 
 I've just rolled seventy thousand miles 
 and it's I mean an eighty-four 
 So 
 Yeah
