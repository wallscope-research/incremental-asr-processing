 So who is your favorite football team
 Well I would say the Saints since 
 <> What's that
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Can't call them the New Orleans Ain'ts any more
 No
 Yeah
 Well I'm a Buffalo Bills fan from a long time ago 
 So it's good to see the Bills doing so well now 
 and 
 Yeah
 What's that
 Jim Kelly
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well the 
 it 
 the N F L draft really seems to be doing its job 
 because got teams like Buffalo who certainly weren't a powerhouse ten years ago 
 Now they've been able to get some good players and come around 
 and th- 
 New Orleans <> the same story 
 and a few years ago Denver was a powerhouse 
 and then they weren't getting the draft picks 
 and now the other team 
 so it seems to be moving around and to New Orleans' benefit
 and you see how 
 look at the Cowboys now 
 they're hurting *[[slash error]] And 
 Yeah
 W- 
 Yeah 
 well yeah 
 firing Tom Landry and hiring Jimmy Johnson 
 what kind of 
 doesn't give you much respect for their team at all 
 any team where the owner would fire Tom Landry you know is like one of the greatest coaches of all time 
 And just because they had a couple of bad seasons 
 And you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching
 Right
 Right 
 And he alway- 
 and had a lot of trouble with injuries too
 You know he'd never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy 
 And then even like what is it Eric Dickerson left the team you know 
 tha- 
 you're right 
 You know like people were jumping ship right and left
 And I don't know 
 that sounds to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem 
 but then the team was sold
 So 
 Yeah
 Right
 Well Yeah
 I know 
 Who was the quarterback
 See I can't even think of who the New Orleans quarterback is 
 Yeah 
 
 were they able to draft anybody this year
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well when is the N F L draft 
 has the N F L draft even gone yet
 Right
 Right
 Well they've 
 yeah 
 they've 
 Sure
 Right
 Or even making the playoffs 
 so that doesn't help you in the draft
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 That was a few years ago
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 
 Right
 it's one thing
 Yeah 
 Buffalo's lucky though to have Jim Kelly than 
 now he's the number one rated quarterback in the N F L I think
 I'm pretty sure he was this past season 
 And then with the defense with Bruce Smith there at linebacker there they've got a very well rounded team 
 and it seems that they've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as problems they had in the past 
 and now they're really playing good together as a team
 So
 when I can 
 I'm a musician 
 and the band I play in I 
 this is just something on the side 
 and the band I play in we tend to rehearse quite a bit on Sundays 
 So I missed a lot of Sundays during this
 Ac- 
 I'd have to confess I don't really scope out the New Orleans games per se
 New Orleans just isn't one of the areas 
 I've lived in so many places 
 I've lived in Denver 
 but I don't like the Broncos 
 There's no love for the Broncos 
 But I've lived in 
 I was born in Buffalo 
 and I lived outside of Boston for five years 
 and then my family lives in Philadelphia now 
 so I tend to look for 
 and I lived in Detroit too 
 So I like 
 first of all first and foremost the Bills games I want to see 
 And then I'll normally check out the Eagles or the Patriots 
 and Patriots were so depressing this last year yeah that I kind of gave up on them
 But first and foremost the Bills 
 I even wen- 
 I got to go to a Bills game this year which was fun 
 It was the Bills Eagles game which appropriately enough fortunately the Bills won
 And it was good weather
 We beat Buffalo in was it third of December 
 And it was sunny and forty-five degrees 
 So we couldn't a done much better than that in Buffalo 
 Yeah
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 my gosh
 Sure
 and then they changed the game
 Right
 Right
 Right
 It was the network
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well that's the guy that counts 
 I don't think Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills any time
