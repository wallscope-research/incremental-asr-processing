 I don't know what the last thing I've done as far as car repairs go is change oil and filter and that kind of stuff 
 I haven't gotten really involved in anything extensive in car repairs in probably a year or so 
 I think the last thing I did of any significance was change the water pump on an Oldsmobile
 Yeah 
 I know what you mean
 Yeah 
 or fuel injected 
 and so there's 
 Yeah 
 No 
 there's no way 
 Somebody once said I had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it 
 and a woman asked me what that meant 
 and I said that means that I can't work on it
 You know they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that average guys can't really go out in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs 
 Yeah
 Absolutely 
 Yeah 
 I used to have Chevy van 
 it was a short van that had the three fifty in it
 And basically it was a motor 
 and you didn't have all the other junk around it
 and you could get to it to work on it
 Yeah 
 the hardest part about water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it
 Well that's kind of the way I was 
 I tried to remember as I took stuff off where it went 
 and I don't think I had too many nuts and bolts left over when I got it all put back together
 yeah Yeah
 I don't think I'd know where to start with a diesel
 Well that's true
 I think the closest thing I've come to a diesel is I've worked for a tractor repair shop when I was in high school 
 and we used to overhaul farm tractors basically
 and they were nearly all diesel 
 but as far as cars I've never never been involved with them
 Well yeah 
 and you can get to them
 Well I 
 Yeah
 I guess you're right 
 the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status 
 I don't know exactly why 
 One of the reasons is 
 I'm beginning to wonder where do you get gas at 
 I su- 
 I don't know if it's still limited like it was 
 I don't notice it probably because I don- 
 
 Yeah 
 I don't notice 
 but maybe because I'm not looking for it
 Yeah 
 But you got the three fifty in the van
 Yeah 
 that's what I like because they've got plenty of power 
 and if you treat them right they're not the gas guzzlers I think that they've got the reputation to be 
 I'm convinced that Detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes
 I'm convinced that the small V eight like the Mustang's original two eighty-nine or some of the Chevy two eighty-threes were good little V eight engines that were not gas guzzlers 
 but they had enough power t- pull all this weight
 And the four cylinders just don't have it
 Yeah
 I think those little V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it 
 but 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 that's kind of like 
 well my first car was a fifty-six Mustang 
 and over the years all 
 I had a Dodge pickup several years ago 
 and I can't remember the size of the engine 
 it was a three seven or something like that
 but I remember working on those cars 
 you'd open the hood 
 and there was basically nothing in there but an engine and a few things 
 Now you open the hood and it's scary
 Like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to
 My dad's got a new 
 I guess it's an eighty-nine or ninety Chrysler something or other 
 It's one of those transverse mounted V sixes front wheel drive
 And he was showing it to me 
 and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean 
 and you know you can see the three spark plugs there in the front 
 And I said well where are the other three
 And he'd never really thought about it
 And he says well hopefully I won't have to change them before I trade it off 
 Yeah 
 it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall
 So they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Yeah 
 the anti-smog pumps
 And all that stuff loads the motor down
 So it's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things 
 But that's one good thing 
 I've got a eight ninety Chevy Blazer now 
 and it's got one belt on it a serpentine belt
 Yeah
 I haven't had to replace the thing yet 
 It looks like it would be better than having 
 I've got an an Olds Toronado that I think's got six belts on the sucker
 And I had to get all those off you know when I was replace that water pump
 And I had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where
 man 
 You bet 
 everything else's got to come off first
 Well it's a pleasure meeting you
 I've got five stickers here from T I 
 so I guess I've done probably I'd say seven or eight of them
 Yeah 
 I haven't gotten any calls in two weeks 
 so I don't know if it's tapering off or what
 I had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting answers
 So it sounds 
 it's taken them fifteen minutes at a time 
 so people are either not 
 no- 
 maybe they're burnt out or 
 yeah
 Anyway let you go 
 Thanks for talking
