 That sounded like one
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 excuse me just a minute 
 I'm on the other line Karen <> 
 I'm sorry
 Okay 
 she 
 yeah 
 well the results 
 I hear what you're saying about the results
 And what to do about it I guess is the big thing
 I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my wife teaches school here in Plano
 And I know that the results that they get out of the system sometime is certainly not you know up to what the effort they put into it you know 
 I've seen that for years 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the home environment
 And no matter what they do in the classroom if they go home at night and you know it's all totally undone 
 the thing that Karen my wife has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what no matter how bad their teachers are no matter what a lousy system they're in or anything else
 these people somehow manage to you know push on through and are successful 
 It's unfortunately probably maybe twenty-five or thirty percent of them do that
 Well that would be at the absolute most
 And you know those that you know come out you know fall out of the system that are real trouble 
 I wonder whether that's just a part of the system you know
 you know in a democracy where you know people have kind of a freedom to sort of do what they want you know there's an inefficiency there
 and you've got to let you know those 
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 And sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive you know
 from the minute that you walk in until you leave your competing against somebody else 
 or your competing against a system or something you know 
 and then a lot of the- 
 there is a personality type I believe that is really noncompetitive 
 They're cooperative rather than competitive
 and when they get into a real competitive system they just say well what the heck and tend not to you know do too awful well 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I would think so 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 it 
 right 
 survival becomes more of a priority than education
 and unfortunately you know there's and old joke about you know 
 education's wasted on the youth anyway
 you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway
 I know when I went to school my attitude was kind of one of you know these people are you know taking a tremendous amount of my time you know 
 and I've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again
 I guess today some how or other there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing 
 but 
 some of the cures that I've heard for this that sort of make sense 
 most teachers after they have taught for a very long especially at the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately
 And it's kind of these intervention programs 
 Now a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism 
 and that's communism
 and that's you know 
 and then it gets political
 But boy
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 yeah
 Well you know the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable 
 There are kids families that should just simply be taken out of the homes you know And you know just removed from those situations
 or they're never going to get anywhere 
 But yet politically that is not a very popular view
 I'm sure that if you you know ran on a platform of you know we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them out of the home 
 Yeah 
 you know how far you're going to get with that
 but unfortunately something like that in lieu of that you know is the intervention programs in school where these kids are spotted fairly early on
 and you know well that's get to be a problem in Texas you know because different school systems have got more or less money to take care of that sort of thing
 you got counselors and all that 
 But you know you can counsel a kid eight hours a day 
 and then he goes home 
 and you know in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or something like that
 or they don't care 
 You know mamma guess what I did in school today 
 well who cares you know
 True
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I'm 
 I don't know if you've ever had too much to do with especially Asian Japanese families coming 
 here in Plano we've got quite a few
 engineering types people who have come from Japan
 and they put their kids in the U S schools 
 and they're appalled
 You know not so much at what the schools are teaching but what they let the kids get away with
 You know they see most 
 they're quite upset about the disruptive influence of school 
 Most of them would say you know those people should be removed from the school system
 And in Japan they would be you know
 But here again you get back into a political thing where 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 were you at Baylor
 Yeah 
 did you go to Baylor
 okay 
 I'm 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 well that's it 
 you don't have the view
 I graduated from Texas Tech more than two years ago I guarantee
 and you know I kind of look back at it sometimes 
 well that was a lot of fun 
 but you know I'm not sure that I took the greatest advantage of you know what I went through there
 Uh-huh
