 <> Well I think it does especially because I just moved to Massachusetts and they're having real problems because they have so many police layoffs
 And personally I don't live in a real bad section of town 
 but just because of the general area I live in the insurance rates are real high on your car 
 and there's a lot of within a few miles of me 
 How about you
 Yeah 
 I 
 Yeah 
 I recently moved here 
 and when I was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in the worst areas of town 
 and my husband was 
 what his concerns were 
 well not that I think you'll get involved in anything but it just be an innocent bystander just to be in that location 
 and I thought how sad it was just to be in a wrong location at the wrong time 
 and a lot of kids you know are caught that way 
 But 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that exactly what happened down here
 Uh-huh 
 I know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime 
 and it doesn't seem like anything is working 
 But on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full 
 at least in this area you know they don't have any room to put anybody 
 so a lot of people just get out you know back on the streets because they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have
 Uh-huh
 I know it 
 they have all sorts of rights that you know are questionable 
 Maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes
 That's true 
 maybe the punishment should be more severe
 I know it
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 because they get involved in things so young that they don't really realize what they're involved in
 And some people prey on that you know 
 they'll take kids who don't really realize the seriousness even at fifteen And get them involved in things because 
 well I don't know 
 I was watching a movie on T V 
 I don't know how true those can be 
 but you know one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them you know you won't have a record because you're under eighteen 
 They'd steal cars and everything
 So I guess if they had more of a deterrent if they had more severe punishments it might be 
 but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial
 I think it would concern me even more if I had children which I don't 
 but if I had children I wouldn't know where to raise them to protect them 
 Uh-huh 
 It's true 
 they talk about too the gangs spreading you know 
 like everybody thinks of them only in L A and New York 
 but they spread out to cover more area 
 and I don't know if gangs occur much down in Texas Do they
 Yeah 
 the same in some of the areas around here 
 but you know I never met anybody that I knew had anything to do with it Or seen anybody 
 but that's a scary thing too because at that age kids want so much to belong to a group 
 And I think that a lot of people that sort of control what they're doing are older you know business you know trying control whatever You know 
 Uh-huh 
 It's true 
 And my God the weapons that people have are 
 some people seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military 
 I don't know where they get them 
 Uh-huh 
 That's the other thing 
 it's hard to even 
 I can't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be 
 Especially if you're an inner city you know you can't really feel like you're putting much of a dent in what's going on 
 And you're putting your life on on the line everyday
 I 
 
 Yeah 
 I just read an article yesterday where this what used to be a nice town in this area they had a lot of budget cutbacks 
 Massachusetts is broke right now 
 and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy 
 and they had to cut twenty guys from their forces 
 and the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldn't be patrolled as well 
 And so it's like 
 This is a depressing conversation though 
 Okay 
 I hope things look up 
 Bye-bye
