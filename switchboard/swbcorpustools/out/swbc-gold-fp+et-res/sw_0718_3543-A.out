 Yes 
 Gary Gilmore
 Yeah 
 That's right 
 and we still have a death penalty
 Some 
 a gentleman that was one of the hi-fi murderers just had his conviction overturned well appealed again
 I guess we have the longest running inmates for death row too 
 And then we had another guy Ronald Lafferty that thought God told him to kill his sister-in-law
 He just got a new trial because the judge felt that he was incompetent
 how do you feel about the death penalty
 Oh
 Well I'm sure that's 
 Well I kind of agree with terrorism 
 I think those guys should be done away with 
 That's one of the worst crimes in my book 
 and drug dealing that's close 
 but terrorism definitely And selling out your country 
 no 
 it's got to be something that is going to cost them because we never lock anybody up forever
 Not very often at all 
 We've got these guys in New York that I'm sure you heard about the ones that killed the gentleman that came from Utah to watch the tennis people
 And I guess they got convicted the four of murder
 So you've come to a definite opinion on it now
 Yeah 
 You kind of hate to 
 You mean violence 
 The witnesses
 Well maybe it would 
 I kind of have a problem with our legal system at the moment as it is 
 I think that people who infringe on other people's rights and screw up their whole lives with rape child molesting terrorism just 
 There's just like five things that I think they ought to be snuffed for 
 but I'm for it for certain reasons
 And I think that things like rape you can't get over it takes a lifetime 
 [ if it was + Yeah 
 If it was ] it would probably have to be a pattern 
 You know we have plenty of convicted guys that go into jail and come back out do the same thing and go back 
 and if they're habitual like three times caught for rape or child molesting then snuff them
 Pardon
 Yeah 
 but we don't seem to keep them long enough
 and then they learn such bad things in jail
 That isn't a place of rehabilitation
 Yeah 
 it's a tough question isn't it on whether at what point do they become so detrimental to society that society can't afford to keep them around to keep giving them chances
 let's see 
 so the other question that they wanted was whether the place that we live in compares to how we feel <> 
 What's the laws there in D C
