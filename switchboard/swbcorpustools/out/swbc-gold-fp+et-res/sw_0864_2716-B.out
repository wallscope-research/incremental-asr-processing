 Yeah 
 I think it's probably a good ideal
 I think well given that there are so many people who don't have health insurance It's probably a real smart thing at least to have some basic coverage for everyone 
 I mean you hear these horror stories of people homeless people going to the hospital [ and + and being thrown out because they have no insurance and having to go to someplace else 
 You know it would be nice if no matter where you are or who you are what happened you know what happened to you you just go to the hospital and they say Okay just take him 
 and we will worry about who he is later 
 so That would be a nice thing
 Yeah 
 I know that's certainly true 
 But I wonder about like in Canada
 In Canada where everybody everybody automatically has insurance in Canada
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 that's true
 That's true 
 that's true
 you 
 so didn't get any choices at all
 that's a problem
 Yeah 
 because I know even among 
 even now the way we have it now there are still 
 Yeah 
 I mean like we have an H M O allows us to pick our own physicians
 I mean I picked a primary care physician and just didn't like him you know
 I had to switch because I just thought he was a quack 
 So Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that is the extreme 
 and what that I think that tends to do though is I think that tends to 
 it probably has two a good and a bad side for young people wanting to become doctors Which again a lot of people who are motivated because the money isn't I guess as much for doctors anymore
 so you wind up getting the people who really want to be doctors being doctors
 but then again you know you don't get those people who would be good and are real smart and decided Hey I want to make a lot of money 
 so I will go into medicine 
 You don't get those
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 Yeah 
 it would be nice to see something where at least 
 I mean even something that says you know look free major medical for all you know everyone 
 and then beyond that you could work out on your own if you want
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 right 
 No
 Yeah 
 they are the ones who make 
 I mean they are the ones 
 they have you know the although 
 I mean it's 
 the unfortunate part of that is that the people I think tend to forget that doctors are humans as well
 So that 
 insurance companies have to charge a substantial amount for certain people or certain types of doctors given that you know someone decides to have a malpractice suit against them well you know it could be millions I mean unfortunately
 And if the doctor whether it was you know 
 I mean I'm sure there are those cases [ where the doctor is wrong or malicious or something
 But you know their you know Mistakes you know 
 Everybody makes mistakes unfortunately
 It shouldn't be a billion dollar you know industry 
 It should be I made a mistake 
 and this is their compensation 
 Not 
 Yeah 
 that is a big problem
 That would be nice
 Uh-huh
 It would be a lot better 
 Yeah
 I mean I'm sort of in a government run medicine program 
 Sort of 
 I'm in a 
 Well well I'm a graduate student
 And 
 At University of Rochester In Rochester New York
 I'll bet you are in Texas
 I was going to bet that 
 okay 
 yeah 
 and as it turns out my wife has pretty decent coverage through her company and can get me coverage as well But yeah which is great
 And because the university offers me two plans 
 They offer what they call the mandatory version which is basically major medical 
 and they offer the portion which is you know sort of everything else you need Sort of your basic care Beyond major medical and stuff
 And they don't 
 and even though my wife's insurance covers me for everything I still have to pay them a hundred and some odd dollars a semester
 And that's for the mandatory portion of the insurance
 Yeah 
 I'm not actually sure if it is or not 
 but people sort of keep fighting it 
 and I'm 
 and I mean to keep fighting it
 but you know it's just one of these things where I just don't want to spend my time
 Well the reason 
 their rational is they make everyone pay for it so that it keeps the cost of university health services down 
 and everyone can use it 
 You know it 
 Because everyone is now forced to pay for this 
 And there is like an 
 Well no 
 well yeah 
 well what they use it 
 no 
 what they use it for is university health services 
 we have a hospital here and a subportion of the hospital
 Right 
 obviously we're paying for the welfare state 
 Now as it turns out my wife and I have chosen to use the university health services as our primary care facility 
 We can do that
 So in 
 but in effect I'm paying twice for one service 
 So 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well that's certainly true
 Right 
 which is ridiculous
 Yeah 
 Everybody else
 Right
 Yeah 
 Exactly 
 I don't 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's one of the strange 
 I think it's strange that as you get older 
 I think the tendency is that as people get older and gain I don't want to say more responsibility but you know things like homes and kids and so forth They tend to lose that liberalism they had when they were younger
 That's probably very true
 No 
 I think people are starting to really mean it 
 I mean everywhere you look you are getting something new 
 I mean you start off you know especially 
 you guys I believe in Texas you don't have state tax do you
 Right 
 we have federal income tax State income tax local income tax
 We have state tax on gasoline you know because our 
 So on top of the federal tax on gasoline we have state tax on gasoline 
 so we are just 
 that could be making up for the difference
