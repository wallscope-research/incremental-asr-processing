 Is it 
 I'd have to agree with that 
 They are my favorite team too
 A little disappointing the last few years
 You know I really don't 
 you know with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money twenty-seven or twenty-nine million or whatever it was I just don't think that they're going to be able to sign Ruben Sierra 
 and it's just going to be a shame for you know our area
 I do too 
 I just 
 The main thing 
 It's just going to effect on the team you know
 We just can't seem to you know 
 I think we've been in this spot 
 I think we finished second once or maybe even twice 
 I don't know 
 I haven't been to a baseball game in a couple of years 
 it's just too disappointing 
 I just watch them fall every year
 I was a Pete Incaviglia fan 
 and I liked him 
 but of course I understand baseball decisions are all just 
 decisions like that have to be made by someone 
 Glad it's not me making them
 They say as long as they draw up two million fans that Greave and Valentine will be there
 and that's the name of the game too 
 You got to make money You know pay these players so much money 
 now it's frightening 
 You and I should be so lucky you know to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that
 Yeah 
 they really do
 I think they need them all 
 I understand the big cities like in New York or L A or somewhere because big cities 
 and you know a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon and probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a men's clothing store or something or sporting goods store 
 but I realize the difference 
 but I just don't understand
 I know
 I tell you
 But one thing I don't understand is why a group you know headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them 
 because I tell you we need a winner in this town 
 It looks like our Cowboys are coming back 
 So that's going to be a big help to Dallas 
 but you know in the past half a dozen years all we've had is the the soccer team
 I know 
 It's 
 I know
 I've been one
 Yeah 
 I've lived here since seventy-four 
 and I've really been a Ranger fan for the longest time 
 and excuse me I don't miss a time picking up the morning paper and checking the box score 
 I mean I follow them 
 and I follow them like I follow the Mavericks and like I follow the Cowboys 
 and I want to see them win because you know damn it the fans deserve it 
 I mean it You know we have pretty great fans put two million people in that stadium
 I love Nolan Ryan 
 I guess you probably love him too
 I do too
 It will
 Well where do you think they are heading this year
 Right 
 Yeah 
 Bobby Witt gets forced into wins like seventeen games or whatever 
 and they have the later ten game winning streak
 and they give him all kinds of money 
 and then he just goes right down the tubes
