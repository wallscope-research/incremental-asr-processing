 Hello there
 I beg your pardon
 No 
 you've reached Dayton Ohio
 you're from North Carolina 
 Where in North Carolina
 Raleigh 
 great 
 Well my name's Mary
 Fernando glad to know you
 I was visiting my son down in Dallas 
 and 
 No 
 no 
 but his wife has a contract with T I 
 and that's how we learned about it 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Right 
 I'm ready
 All right 
 okay
 if I knew that I'd be a very wealthy person
 Well you have to see 
 the way I look at it you have to think first of all why 
 *[[listen]] or has ] crime increased 
 and if so why has crime increased
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 It's easy 
 you said the magic word there
 Drugs 
 And that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased
 yes
 Yeah
 No 
 they don't want the money for food 
 that's for sure
 Well but you know the perhaps not strange but something that many people don't realize is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids 
 because I'm a retired educator
 And in fifty-one and fifty-two the police came to the high school where I was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs how to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started and so on and so on 
 So it's a problem that's been around for over forty years 
 and we're just really now trying to figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers the big dealers in drugs may be part of the power structure that's keeping us from spending the money in that direction
 That's right 
 they'll never get caught
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 But they'll 
 That's right
 That's right 
 and they 
 one person doesn't know the other person down the line
 But the guy at the very top the one who's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure and had the political pull to keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction other than on the drug dealing 
 because it sure is monstrous in this country
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 might
 *[[spelling]] Nope 
 I only heard about it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 really you know 
 even in our prison systems they're finding that they're having drugs smuggled into them
 Right
 Been nice talking with you
 I beg your 
 we've been talking for a little bit 
 I appreciate the call 
 I enjoyed talking with you 
 Uh-huh 
 bye-bye
