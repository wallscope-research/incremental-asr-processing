 All right 
 I've never done it before 
 so I guess that's all I have to do right 
 I've been called several times 
 and I pushed in my number 
 they kept saying you have the invalid code
 and then I found out that my new phone wasn't working right
 so this is the first time I've even done it
 I wonder how long it's going to be on for
 no 
 I mean this whole thing like for two months or something 
 do you know
 Yeah 
 okay 
 well back to crime 
 I guess we're supposed to talk about that
 They say what aspect are you worried about 
 well I think at this point I for one am worried about every aspect 
 I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common that's really something you got to protect yourself from
 Uh-huh 
 golly 
 I know
 Have they done that in Garland
 Now 
 Right
 Well we had a vice principal shot at here last year you know on the school grounds after school 
 And the one boy killed himself a few years ago in a grade school 
 so you know these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any neighborhood doesn't seem like
 So Yeah 
 it's kind of scary to think you send your child to school 
 and you wonder if he's going to get shot 
 I mean we didn't have to worry about that before
 What next
 Right 
 and you know we can't really depend on the police to solve all this 
 they just can't do it
 I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent 
 and how we going to bring that back together 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 and 
 I think so 
 and then there's a drop in the training of morals really you know
 some of these young kids you read about just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all
 I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood
 I think it was just rare 
 I really do
 My mother well she's like seventy-four now 
 when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in California 
 and she was dating this millionaire's son 
 and he wanted to marry her 
 and she wouldn't marry him 
 and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both 
 and 
 No 
 I'm the one 
 Yeah 
 that must have been at least fifty years ago or more 
 but the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers all over the country for weeks
 but now you know you wouldn't probably read about it here in Texas
 it's just you know another killing
 Uh-huh
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 lots of their picture and life story and everything
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 I know how we straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible
 So that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin well the same thing happened here in Arlington when was it I think it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with
 Yeah 
 I think it was on a Hard Copy 
 she was a real attractive blond girl in her freshman year of college
 and some boy she tried to get rid of he was like in his twenties 
 Remember that
 Right 
 right 
 that's 
 My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School
 Yeah 
 can you believe it 
 that's just 
 Taco Bueno 
 right 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 isn't that weird
 I know 
 and the police are not going to do anything until they've committed some sort of a crime 
 You know he was just begging her on the phone 
 that's not doing anything
 And there are times I think gee I should give my kids gu-
