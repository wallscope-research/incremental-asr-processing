 Well I do cross-stitch 
 and I enjoy reading and playing softball
 really
 Well I know that I learned how to knit one time and made a few things 
 but I haven't done it in so long that I probably wouldn't remember how 
 Well if I remember I think we made some like Christmas stockings 
 you could make like the granny squares or whatever and sew them together and make Christmas stockings and maybe some slippers or something like that
 Nothing as big as a blanket
 I know that my husband's grandmother does a lot of that
 And she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff 
 but 
 Yeah 
 do you have any other hobbies
 well that's good
 So are you on the T V then
 Oh
 okay
 So you don't have too much time for hobbies
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 
 I'm a housewife
 So unless the kids are asleep I don't usually get much done either 
 But I've made a few things cross-stitch things 
 I really enjoy doing that
 And I made like stockings for both my children and a Christmas tree shirt and that type of thing 
 and it just takes a long time to get it done 
 but you know once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good to see it
 Really 
 I guess you can make baby blankets that wouldn't take as long 
 Two
 Yeah 
 Not quite 
 It's a fulltime job 
 yeah
 So have you sang at any weddings yet
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 that's a good place 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well that's good
 Yeah
 that's true
 Make your hobby into a business that would be pretty good 
 Yeah 
 Did you have training in singing when you were younger then 
 or 
 Choirs and that kind of stuff
 
 Well that's nice
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 not just give up your job and jump right into it 
 Uh-huh 
 <> Yes
 Oh
 I don't know 
 I've only done this one other time 
 and I thought that the man told me five minutes
 okay 
 It was nice talking to you too 
 good luck with your singing 
 Okay 
 bye
