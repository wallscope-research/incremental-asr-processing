 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 I see
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's for sure
 Well we 
 I just got married about six months ago 
 and we bought a house at the same time 
 So we're 
 I'm sitting here in my forty year old house 
 and we're about halfway through the painting process 
 So the only 
 I guess the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color 
 We ended up with our living and dining room are now kind of a light peach color with 
 and it's got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff 
 so we've got the trim in kind of an off-white 
 And this is really the first interior painting project that I've attacked 
 And it's been something else to say the least 
 we had the same type of situation 
 the walls were 
 well they weren't 
 the color difference wasn't so bad 
 but there was semigloss underneath
 and we put a flat over the top 
 and everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see 
 It seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint
 Every time the sun would come up in the morning I'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can 
 But we've learned 
 we've worked our way back into the hallway 
 and we're in the middle of the bathroom now 
 But it's been quite an adventure 
 <> the other thing that makes it a little more difficult we've got all hardwood floors 
 and we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the first time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a toothbrush and what not cleaning up
 Well it's not too bad 
 It it 
 the floors are finished with a polyurethane
 and it's really not to bad to get off 
 *[[typo to> too]] it 
 it 
 we're just using latex 
 and it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even 
 it comes off with like a mild abrasive pad like a scotch-brite pad or something like that and soap and water 
 So we got pretty lucky on that
 No 
 not really
 But 
 Okay 
 yeah
 Yeah
 gosh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 probably so
 Okay
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I 
 Yeah 
 our house was painted as part of the purchase contract 
 so we didn't have to mess with that this time 
 But I grew up on a farm 
 so I've messed with outdoor painting a little bit 
 but most of that it was done with a sprayer and up in the bucket of a loader tractor or something like that 
 so it took a lot of the hassle out 
 And then they're 
 you know you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a grainery or something like that as you would be with your own house
 a little bit 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 gosh 
 yeah 
 just the opposite of what everybody's working towards now
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 absolutely 
 Yeah 
 we stocked up the first time around 
 But we've definitely got all the formulas on file 
 and they'll be there for a while 
 we're pretty comfortable with that 
 But yeah it 
 it 
 I'm real nervous every time I open a new can 
 I'm wondering if I shouldn't buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a washtub or something somewhere because I'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match
 But It's gone pretty well 
 It just 
 it takes some time 
 My problem is while I 
 I'm not overly proud of it 
 but I'm a self-proclaimed perfectionist 
 and it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that 
 And I'll find something as I'm going along something not related 
 like I've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they really didn't match 
 They were 
 a few of them were broken and things like that 
 So I always pick up these little extra tasks as I'm doing this
 and the painting actually takes probably a fourth of the time 
 and I'm always doing all this other stuff 
 and my wife's hollering at me and wondering what else I've come home with from work this time to put in a ceiling fan or something strange like that 
 So it always 
 it gets you to look at everything real hard when you start putting a coat of paint on everything 
 you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it sure makes a difference
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's been 
 we bought this house with the idea that we were going to you know spend a lot of time working on it 
 and it was part you know 
 part of the excitement was getting a good deal on an older house that just really hadn't been taken care of very well 
 it was actually 
 it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that 
 So we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it 
 But there just isn't enough time 
 I find myself going to work knowing that there's a job about half done at home 
 and I really 
 if I'd just stay home and finish it I'd feel a lot better 
 but I'm starting to learn that there's always something else 
 Once you get done you can always start over 
 and you make up all kinds of excuses 
 So *[[ slash error ]] not a whole lot 
 *[[slash error]] It 
 they're in pretty good condition as far as major repairs You know a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that 
 but the only 
 the most major things have been I guess I moved a couple of outlets and switches I should say 
 For some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway 
 and 
 yeah 
 and I didn't like that very well 
 so I moved that 
 but most of it's in pretty good shape/
 live in Dallas
 Okay 
 okay
 
 No 
 no 
 I haven't 
 I hadn't tried
 In fact we were planting flowers this weekend 
 So I was pretty tied up 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that 
 Yeah 
 you know it 
 I get a sore neck from looking up all the time yeah things like that 
 but no 
 that pretty much covers my experiences
 yeah 
 most definitely 
 it just 
 it makes such a difference 
 I 
 like I say the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much 
 I don't want to put a price on it 
 but I just feel like every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house 
 You know every time I do something aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home an you know the walls are clean 
 and they match and all those kinds of things
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 we do 
 it sometimes works 
 and it sometimes doesn't 
 It's a 
 when I start doing trim I've gotten to where I tend to freehand it because there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore 
 and 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 they y- 
 No 
 there's no carpet in the house right now
 kay 
 Well you know 
 Yeah 
 I've seen 
 they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths 
 And you can tape them together 
 and put
