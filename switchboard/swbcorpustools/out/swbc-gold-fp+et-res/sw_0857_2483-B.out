 Okay 
 No 
 I'm not
 And I think a great number of students who got word of it and participated in general and voiced who heard about the program
 I rely primarily on newspaper combined with television
 
 Okay
 That's rather interesting
 I'd have to say I haven't either
 I listen to the radio probably five or six hours a week 
 but almost inevitably to a station that is a classical station here for music purposes 
 We don't use the radio as a wake up 
 we have a television connected to a electronic alarm system that kicks in 
 and it comes on with C N N in the morning
 That 
 we wake up to television news and shower and dress and whatever to that 
 and then because of the fact that my wife and I ride to work together in a car we chat at each other rather than something else 
 and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in the car 
 so we have the advantage of being able to read and drive although there seems to be from what I've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving 
 So we rely pretty heavily I think on a combination of the two 
 I also use NEWSWEEK magazine 
 we tend to alternate between NEWSWEEK and TIME and whatever happens to be the news magazine of the year for us
 and I read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other you know trade magazines such as that where I might read the the occasional social and even current event commentaries and everything as diverse as A C M to some of the other tabloids I get 
 So I guess I use about eighty percent written is probably my input and twenty percent television 
 I think I respect from a journalistic perspective current events 
 I've always said that it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline
 other than that it was a at best
 we're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in Raleigh 
 there are other 
 I'm not sure what you would call them the small competing independent sort of newspapers 
 Little small weekly things 
 but there's only one daily called the NEWS AND OBSERVER fondly referred to here by some as the sometimes the Noise and Observer
 it depends 
 It has decent national coverage but has an extremely focused political coverage probably steeped in the southern history and the fact that this is a Democratic State 
 And consequently everything is filtered through that Republican Democratic sort of glass almost unnecessarily 
 so 
 Yeah 
 we have 
 that is 
 as a matter of fact they update it once a week with a special section 
 and we pay it sort of glancing nod 
 We have a very good friend who is tapped into the city planning structure our developer architect friend 
 and 
 Right 
 So I think we find out what's happening in the city on a fairly frequent basis over a gin and tonic sort of thing
 and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of Raleigh than the paper would have anyway
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Is that right 
 I heard there was some stuff on the radio that was equivalent to C N N
 Okay
 Okay
 
 That didn't 
 Uh-huh
 we probably were listening to C N N fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began 
 we almost live and breathed it because during the war itself to the point where we began to sort of have household pact of lets turn the war off and get something done
 almost an addition 
 and we could equate or relate relay well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in uncoupling from the events and going on with their 
 So 
 instead of watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever 
 and because of that we began towards the middle of the war I guess about two and a half or three weeks in we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would watch fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news or our local news 
 We would watch C N N until six thirty then we would watch a rotating network news of either A B C C B S or N B C 
 and we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one 
 And we would watch the first fifteen minutes 
 and then we would turn the television off 
 and we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on news that way 
 And then we would do a similar thing at ten forty-five because C N N would be wrapping their hourly coverage up 
 and then we would get the local coverage 
 and then I think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would have better state coverage rather than local coverage 
 three of the networks here on their local news 
 that 
 if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who murdered who or stole what from whom 
 And that was the sort of thing that I would say is the best 
 and not news 
 unless there's some trend or something that says Jesus this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever that's sort of more of a pattern news
