 Well I haven't heard anything about the proposal myself 
 but I don't know if its their proposal or one that's being seriously kicked around 
 I've always felt for a long time that I think that all young kids ought to do a stint primarily in the military
 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 a lot 
 yeah 
 well you take Israel
 I mean everybody does
 I don't think it's a bad idea 
 teaches a lot 
 I mean I went in the service when I was eighteen And stayed in for ten years
 Yeah 
 did a lot of growing up
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Do it himself 
 Well my parents wanted to send me to college 
 and I was dead set against it 
 You know I had wanderlust you know
 And I got in 
 and after wasting the first six years partying and everything else I decided uh-huh time to settle down and do something 
 So I started to work on my education
 Course my job was such that I couldn't do it as much as I wanted
 and still I ended up going two semesters when I got out just to get my degree
 But I've been in school ever since 
 Yeah 
 I guess
 Yeah 
 I mean if you don't like 
 Sure
 Exactly
 yeah 
 Absolutely 
 all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients 
 and if they're able-bodied people I don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and if nothing else get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards paint the houses
 Sure 
 sure 
 So I'm 
 get something out of that money
 Yeah 
 I've 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 my next door neighbor when I was growing up worked for the unemployment division 
 and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied 
 and 
 Yeah 
 and he had all kinds of horror stories 
 You know these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks 
 and back in those days they also use to give you booklets good for clothing and gas and things like this 
 They get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know 
 and I have a hard time dealing with that
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I know 
 you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient
 and there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy
 You know it's totally ridiculous 
 and now I started out when I first got in graduate school 
 I was going into public administration 
 and quite honestly I just got so fed up with it I just couldn't stand it any more
 Yeah 
 I mean this is the kind of thing you look at
 You sit there 
 and when you're writing up budgets you wonder okay how much money do we need 
 Well you need X number dollars for the recipients 
 but you need X number dollars to administer the program 
 Well just ridiculous
 This is ridiculous
 It is 
 it's pathetic 
 I mean there's got to be a different way 
 There's got to be a better way 
 But it'll never happen 
 I mean these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks
 I think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as 
 and I would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance
 Give an incentive
 Yeah 
 Something that's going to help them along the way
 Sure 
 I mean 
 Well this 
 I mean look at the statistics 
 I mean it's sad 
 One in five Americans can't read
 adults that is can't even read 
 and we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math
 I mean what are we becoming 
 We're becoming a service country
 Yeah 
 we were an industrial giant 
 and now we're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game 
 We taught them how to do it 
 and they did it better than we do
 Simple as that
 yeah 
 simple as that
 Yeah 
 it's terrible for us
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and it can be good for them too
 I mean even the greedy kids that we've got now 
 I know
 I know
 Well you know you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house
 Yeah 
 that's my other complaint 
 Parents aren't parents any more
 Yeah 
 One of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble
 Well as a substitute teacher for a year I can say yes
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Exactly
 Well in a way it is 
 but you have to look out for yourself you know 
 I mean that's some- 
 and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers 
 Yeah 
 gosh 
 I mean 
 No 
 I mean yeah 
 They do an absolutely necessary job 
 I mean I have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that
 But I mean there's a sense of priorities here too
 You know we need 
 what's more important picking up the garbage or educating our kids
 Yeah 
 they 
 sure
 I mean one's import- 
 I mean on the other hand I mean you take a garbage man in New York City starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars
 Well I bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year
 I mean my other pet peeve is unions
 You know it's ridiculous the way unions have gone 
 There was a time when unions were needed
 And they served a good function 
 but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated 
 and they're only there to perpetuate their own power structure
 Yeah
 Sure 
 and that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country
 So many times I mean you had the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time 
 And well that took care of that industry
 and I'll tell you 
 Detroit worked awfully hard on stopping car manufacturing in this country
 Yeah 
 I mean you know we've never caught up 
 and I don't think we ever will
 Yeah 
 I mean here it is 
 and we've got to go into partnership with the Japanese to build cars
 You know And they only did it because I guess they were embarrassed that they're so good at it 
 Gosh 
 Yeah 
 well back to the original subject 
 yeah 
 I think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service 
 I don't care what kind it is
 Yeah 
 and pride in themselves too
 I mean you could organize something just within your community same old thing 
 I mean 
 Sure 
 Uh-huh
 I think they ought to take them and I don't know just have sort of like a manpower pool and say Okay look 
 we need somebody
