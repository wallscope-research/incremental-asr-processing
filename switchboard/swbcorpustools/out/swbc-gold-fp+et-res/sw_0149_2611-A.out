 Okay 
 I was just trying to think about how I dress for work you know 
 T I is a very casual atmosphere
 And what I usually do on the weekend is lay out five outfits 
 and on Monday I wear the worst looking one Because it doesn't seem like people you know are that alive on Monday you know 
 so 
 And then progressively through the week I'll wear nicer looking things 
 and then on Friday most everybody wears jeans and sweatshirts or you know jeans and blouses or something like that 
 but mostly what I wear are skirts and blouses or you know skirts and pullover sweaters or you know little two piece dress suits like 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 Like where I work it's pretty casual 
 I guess it's more like a college campus 
 also I mean there's you know hundreds of people work for T I
 And a lot of people just wear jeans and sweats all the time 
 and they dress up like when customers are coming in or when we have department meetings or something like that 
 And you know a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for the real higher ups like the T I lawyers and those that work for the higher executives those secretaries they really dress up all the time
 So there's a good combination in the hallways all the time you know 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 And that's very acceptable at T I
 I believe at I B M they make you wear a blue suit and some kind of colored shirt and a tie
 Uh-huh 
 I would hate to be in that atmosphere
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 I see
 Yeah 
 T I is everywhere
 Uh-huh
 That's true 
 that's a good idea 
 Uh-huh
 The 
 no 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke area and you don't smoke you almost strangle
 So much smoke in the air 
 Yeah 
 the smoking area you know it's closed in
 and if you don't smoke and you go in there 
 everybody that goes in there smokes 
 so it's full of smoke when you go in there 
 I used to smoke a long time ago
 I used to burn my clothes talking about getting back to clothes 
 I used to burn my clothes with cigarettes 
 That's one of the reason that I stopped 
 Yeah 
 yeah she always had to have a lot of clothes
 No 
 I wasn't either 
 my daughter she's real good at finding sales though you know
 yeah she'll buy a lot clothes at the end of seasons you know and just have them for the next year 
 And you know she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and buys clothes 
 you know when they were coming up I didn't sew 
 but now I've learned how to sew 
 so I'm still learning how 
 and I'm getting much better at it 
 and I'm going to be able to make my own clothes
 Right
 Right 
 because clothes are really expensive You know 
 a little simple shell blouse you know that you can make for about say ten dollars at the most out of a decent fabric boy runs you like twenty something dollars in the store
 Just a little shell to go under a suit you know
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 especially to pay that kind of money for it
 I have a friend who 
 she had a little boy 
 and she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus 
 I mean she dressed him fabulously 
 And then seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff
 And she finally learned that you just can not do this you know 
 *[[can not> cannot]] So now she finds the basement sales just like you know everybody else
 Right
 Yes 
 and you 
 Right
 And yeah 
 and you just have to keep buying them you know 
 if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the quality is really not that great you know for the price that you pay
 Right
 Right
 Like I bought the most beautiful sweater from I believe it was Ross Dress For Less 
 And it was really pretty 
 you know it was just a plain you know round necked sweater 
 And like it was embellished around the top you know 
 it had leather designs and some other little things on it 
 and I just thought it was so pretty 
 and I got it at a real good price 
 I think maybe it was nine ninety-nine or something
 And it was so pretty 
 and after I wore it a couple of times I realized why it was so cheap 
 in the middle of the back of it there was 
 it's like there 
 it had been slit 
 and they had like just sewed it back together right in the middle of the back you know 
 wasn't a seam or anything you know
 And that's why it was so cheap although it's not really noticeable <> from the outside 
 but still you know it's really not a good quality
 And then I was told by somebody that works for J C Penney's that Ross is just one of those places that sells seconds
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 they don't really buy the first quality 
 they buy the second 
 And places like J C Penney's they'll reject the seconds 
 they'll send them back every time
 But places like Ross Dress For Less and T J Max 
 Uh-huh
