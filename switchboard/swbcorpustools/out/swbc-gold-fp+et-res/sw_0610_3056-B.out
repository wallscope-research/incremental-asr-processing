 Hi
 books 
 actually I am reading a couple of different books 
 one is a story 
 well it is not a story 
 it is a collection of memos supposedly written by Howard Hughes 
 that was 
 it came out a couple of years ago 
 and I have just now gotten around to reading it 
 I have had it a couple years 
 but jus- 
 I do not remember the man's name 
 he used to be a reporter for I think the NEW YORK TIMES or the WASHINGTON POST one of the two 
 and he supposedly was contacted by this guy who had these memos he wanted to sell 
 and they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the corporate headquarters in Los Angeles
 They on 
 I think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something there in Los Angeles 
 they used to have a 
 or I guess they still do 
 had a big warehouse kind of thing which had offices 
 and it was sort of nondescript you know for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected 
 he was a great collector of everything 
 he did not throw anything away 
 and supposedly this guy had been breaking there for awhi- 
 he was a like you know burglar had been breaking there awhile And had ended up 
 he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect 
 and they broke in one night and found a bunch of memos that were supposedly from Hughes to his main assistant back in the fifties and I guess in the sixties up until his death
 So it's pretty interesting work 
 so 
 Yeah 
 it's a little hard 
 you have to plod through it 
 and you know it does not have a real story or any plot
 you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on
 No 
 I have not seen it
 but it is real interesting
 I also reading thi- 
 it's another old book that I happen to have 
 I am sort of rereading it 
 It's a book about the Bermuda Triangle 
 but it's a real good book that a guy wrote who was a research librarian 
 he wrote sort of debunking many of the stories about the Bermuda Triangle You know 
 he was thinking many of the myths of the triangle actually could be explained
 you know and the reason I picked it back up was in light of Well when they found the airplanes in the Atlantic thinking they were Flight Nineteen 
 And I don't know if you are familiar with that at all 
 but it's 
 Flight Nineteen was a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two Right after World War Two 
 and they were lost 
 and 
 Yeah 
 they were
 and in the book you know even 
 he wrote this book back in the seventies 
 and even then he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water 
 because he goes through and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth 
 And it's probably you know real close to what you know everyone is thinking now that they just got turned around and could not find their way back
 no 
 I have not
 Yeah 
 I would like to too 
 because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her you know possibilities of where she 
 
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 So that is pretty much for right now 
 that is what I have been reading 
 I kind of like to read different stuff 
 and I like to read a novel every now and then 
 but I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time
 Yeah
 Yes
 Yeah 
 I read that too 
 I got it right after it came out 
 My you know 
 he was an assistant district attorney in Chicago while he was writing the book 
 and my sister-in-law lives in Chicago 
 and before it actually got big she sent me this book saying you might like this 
 this guy is you know from here 
 And I read it and really liked it 
 and then about 
 that is when it really got big 
 And so I 
 BONFIRE OF THE VANITY 
 I have not read that although I have heard it is pretty good
 Yeah 
 that is what I have heard
 I saw the movie 
 and 
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 I know
 Yeah
 I have a lot of computer books that 
 I do computer work 
 and so I have a lot of those 
 So I spend a lot of time looking through those not necessarily reading them but looking through them 
 But I'm interested in a lot of that 
 but I have got a lot of books that I intend to read 
 but I have not been able to yet you know for one reason or another
 gosh I do not really have a list 
 cause I just have all the books out you know 
 I have book shelves 
 and I have them all out 
 and usually when I am through with one I will go in and look through 
 I have one now {A and I can not remember the name of it } that I got is 
 the sister-in-law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or Christmas or something will send me another good book 
 and sh- 
 I have one 
 and I can not remember the name of it 
 it is supposed to be a mystery
