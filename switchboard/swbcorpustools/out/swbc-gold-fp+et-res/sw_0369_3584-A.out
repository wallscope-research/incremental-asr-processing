 Well tell me about your home
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 
 It sounds nice
 yeah
 Yeah 
 Well you know these guys that gambled high lost big you know
 And I'm insulating myself from that problem 
 I'm building my own house
 And as I look out the window of my trailer I can envision all the insulation that's going up today 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I used to be a builder
 And I retired about five years ago and started college
 And now I'm a college educated builder 
 There's still no work you know 
 So you know I decided this summer that you know we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials 
 so I did
 And see the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home
 You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house 
 but you can't borrow the money to build your own
 Well it's to protect the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
 and then it doesn't sell 
 and then the bank's holding the bag
 Well 
 as you know anything that involves the government works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much Right 
 Hence the savings and loan problem we have
 But you know my home is fairly simple 
 It's designed to be added on to
 Yeah 
 Well I figure it's just me and my wife 
 but you know I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot 
 so I want to have a shop
 Ten acres
 Well yeah 
 It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor 
 He's on the other side of a hill
 And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon
 Seriously
 Well in the winter time I can see another guy 
 but you know 
 I can just make out his place you know I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north
 And 
 Yeah 
 Well I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the house has no heating or air conditioning
 Well it's got a very small furnace
 And we'll use a wood burning stove as well
 But in the house itself I've been working inside you know these many months
 and I have not had to use the heat
 Because it's all geothermal
 And with all the 
 see I've got 
 on the south side is all glass 
 Well as much as I could get in it you know And the east side is glass 
 I've got one two three four five <> six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet 
 So it's almost all glass
 And 
 yeah 
 I mean you know There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows
 So 
 Well not really 
 it's on the side of a hill
 So the first you know 
 the 
 what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep
 And the side that's on the other side is about six feet high
 So I've got a pretty good grade there
 And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop
 Exactly
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
