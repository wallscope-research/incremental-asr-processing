 Okay 
 movies 
 I haven't seen too many lately 
 I have kids 
 and we went and saw THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER over the break 
 do you have kids you take to movies 
 or 
 Yeah 
 It's a Walt Disney movie 
 and it didn't get you know as good a reviews as like the LITTLE MERMAID their last one and got all kinds of Academy Awards and things last year 
 But this one I thought was excellent 
 The 
 Yeah 
 it's animated 
 And I can't believe how good they're getting with their animation now 
 It's just the special effects you know 
 And in this movie there's this boy 
 and he rescues this bald eagle 
 and it's a huge eagle you know wing span of twenty feet or something like that 
 And the boy actually rides on his back 
 and he rides through the clouds you know 
 and you see him coming out of the clouds his head coming out and then the bird coming out 
 and you know they're flying all over with it 
 And I mean I know there must have been computers or something for animation this day 
 but it was just so real realistic and lifelike and good animation 
 It was a good show
 Well ROGER was a composite one
 there's a movie I've seen ROGER RABBIT 
 That's not a recent movie 
 but I enjoyed that show
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Chop them up 
 This is supposed to be the guy that's replaces Bruce Lee or whatever or the next Chuck Norris type of guy
 Uh-huh
 Superstar
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Really uplifting 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I hadn't heard much about that movie 
 I 
 other than it was a chop them up movie 
 But well I guess that's one I won't go see 
 you went to the dollar movie 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 they show up at the dollar movie right after they come out 
 You know they're usually not that great or didn't do that great anyway
 Let me see 
 Let me see 
 another movie I watched 
 I want to see that new one that won all those Academy Awards this year DANCES WITH WOLVES
 I haven't seen that 
 Have you seen that one yet
 what 
 the wide open the spaces 
 Uh-huh
 Is that right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right 
 Yeah 
 our movies today it used to be X 
 you know and P Gs used to be Rs 
 and seems like the rating system you know is kind of switching that way a little bit 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 It's just that 
 yeah 
 it's just that the rating system seems you know instead of having X now they have what N C seventeen
 They just changed it because X had a connotation with it you know 
 so 
 Right
 A lot of those are really violent type movies
 Really gory
 Yeah
 Let me see 
 One movie I saw I guess it was a while back RED OCTOBER
 Have you seen that one
 Yeah 
 I read the book before 
 so I knew the story line going in 
 but they changed some things in the movie 
 It wasn't the same 
 I thought the book was better than the movie 
 but I thought the movie was really good as well
 Yeah 
 I don't 
 I read about one or two thick novels like that a year You know 
 that's about all the time I can spare 
 But that was a good show I thought you know 
 I read about how they did an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine 
 You know that wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water 
 it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic
 All those underwater scenes 
 I thought you know 
 it looked to me like it was a real submarine that was in the water you know
 Yeah
 Is that right
 I didn't
 What's that about
 
 to fool people 
 and 
 All the tricks
 Uh-huh 
 That sounds like an interesting concept
 To understand what's going on in the second
 Uh-huh 
 They're supposed to be coming out with all these Desert Storm movies this summer too 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well they had some 
 in some of those you know I guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about Lebanese and Americans 
 and they decide make it Iraqis and Americans you know 
 and they just change the title and reshot a few parts you know yeah you know where they could 
 I guess they figured we can't tell the difference between an 
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Right 
 It was such a 
 it 
 I guess they'll probably come out with a lot of movies you know 
 it was such a rout though you know 
 I don't know you know 
 they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or about those two newsmen or whatever that got captured
 Is that right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well I think we've probably 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it's been about five minutes 
 It's been nice talking with you
 Keep on watching those movies 
 Okay 
 Bye-bye
