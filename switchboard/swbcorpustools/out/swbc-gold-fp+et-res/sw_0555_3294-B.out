 Well let's see
 As far as I'm 
 Well the thing I think that annoys me the most is I have young children a baby in the house 
 and inevitably as soon as they're asleep someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something
 And I think that that is probably the most aggravating 
 you know it invades my time 
 I'm the one that pays for the phone 
 if I want to buy something I'll take the initiative and go find it you know 
 And that just really does aggravate me 
 what do you think
 Your time is valuable 
 and 
 I 
 that's interesting 
 I 
 the market seems to just be growing too 
 I guess enough people are not speaking out 
 I'm not speaking out that's for sure 
 I just get aggravated about it 
 And 
 I really don't know 
 I'm not into heavy government legislating of a lot of different areas 
 but I don't know 
 I do particularly find it annoying 
 I'm really not sure 
 I haven't given that a lot of thought if it should go you know *[[slash error]] to be 
 Well yeah that might 
 Identify themselves yeah
 Right
 Well that would be an interesting way 
 yeah
 Right
 Right 
 you're 
 is that right 
 that's interesting
 And they just get everybody
 boy 
 Well I do wish that it would stop on my end because it seems to happen at the worst possible moments 
 And I guess the next one is door-to-door solicitors 
 I don't mind the children when they're selling things for school 
 I have kids 
 and you know that's just kind of part of it 
 but when it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning it makes you not feel particularly safe
 and it's annoying as well
 Right 
 you really don't know 
 so I find myself being a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than I might normally be
 but I do feel like it's an invasion of my space 
 And 
 I've never quite understood the purpose of that 
 Yeah 
 I 
 Just be- 
 Just a survey
 Yeah
 There have been a couple of times when whatever the subject was I guess caught my interest and I went along with it 
 and then there have been several times when I just said well I just really don't have the time you know to deal with it at that moment
 But I don't get too many of those
 I've had just a few
 generally someone's trying to sell me something 
 or 
 Right 
 right
 Right
 Yeah
 That's right
 Oh
 Right
 Yeah
 Well we 
 That's true
 Yeah 
 you just never know I guess
 That 
 yeah 
 I 
 Asking for information is 
 I can't really see that 
 I think if nothing else they ought to spend money for a postage stamp 
 and you know when it arrives at your house I
