 Well we don't do so much now 
 but when I was a child we went regular old camping tents and everything like that 
 And then with our children we had a pop up tent camper
 And we used that to go camping
 years ago we lived in Oklahoma 
 and we went to I mean Lake Murray all the time 
 But when we did it with our children we lived in Tennessee 
 and we went up to the Smokeys Which was just absolutely fantastic
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 And along the 
 there's a ridge that goes down from Tennessee through Georgia and into Alabama 
 and I think it was called White Cloud or White Mountain And went up on it
 It got real cold 
 but the camper had beds in it you know when we had that one 
 so you know we had our bedding 
 We didn't have to go with sleeping bags 
 But the when I was a teenager and growing up that was sleeping bags and joining blankets and sleeping on ledges or you know ground 
 And that got kind of rough sometimes 
 do you
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 Oh
 just beautiful
 Yes
 Yes 
 I understand that 
 But yeah
 my husband and I he says his idea now of roughing it is the Regency Hyatt
 And I agree with him
 Our children are grown 
 but I know that we liked it when our kids were teenagers because we got away from the T V and the phone
 And we got just strictly by ourselves 
 We 
 some of the time we would not allow them to take friends along so that it was just the four of us
 you know and we could you know get back in touch with each other 
 I know
 I know 
 you know they just thoroughly You know Or enjoyed it Uh-huh
 Yes 
 yes
 Yes 
 like I know that you know breakfast you know we'd have these big breakfasts cooked over this little Coleman stove 
 and Yes 
 and it would just absolutely taste wonderful
 Yes 
 One 
 yes 
 yes
 But I know that you know as a teenager growing up and going to Lake Murray there would be maybe twenty twenty-five of us because it would be all of my mother's family you know and all my cousins 
 And it 
 no
 we were in the woods you know
 Well we didn't notice it back then 
 but that was back before air-conditioning was so you know prevalent and all
 And you know it always rained on us 
 I don't care what weekend we went and when it was it always rained on us
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Cuddle up uh-huh
 Well I don't know 
 I remember one time some cousins were in a tent 
 and it was married cousins 
 and they had the tent 
 and this you know frog strangler that we used to call them came through 
 and they had put their tent over kind of 
 I don't know what 
 it wasn't a creek bed 
 it was kind of like a little little gully or trench or something 
 and the water rushed down 
 and they said they looked down and there went Bud's boots 
 and you know There went several things floating down this water you know 
 We just used to have balls
 You know it was more fun 
 You know and as I said it just rained every time
 And then my folks had a cabin at one time at Lake Tenkiller 
 and we went up there 
 but it was never quite the same thing You know
 Yes 
 yes 
 it does
 It really does 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 even I would kind of like to go
 And I know if I go home and say let's go camping my husband says you're crazy 
 I enjoyed talking to you too
 Thank you 
 Bye-bye
