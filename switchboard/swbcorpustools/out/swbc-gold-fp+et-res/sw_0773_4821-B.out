 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well I get a weekend paper as well 
 and in addition to that I get a local weekly 
 I live in suburb of Milwaukee
 and they have community newspapers around here so their extremely local stuff is in the local paper that comes out once a week 
 and then I get the Sunday MILWAUKEE JOURNAL because I don't have time to read a paper 
 mostly that's my difficulty 
 I get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do although I do listen to N P R and that's National Public Radio which has very good coverage of the national and international news and does a pretty good job of analysis as well 
 No 
 I'm not actually 
 but I can run my radio in my office 
 I teach at the university 
 and when I'm not teaching if I choose to have the radio on I can listen to that station 
 so 
 are you satisfied with the TWENTY TWENTY and FORTY-EIGHT HOURS and the things that you do watch 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is the timely noting of the events as they happen 
 Is that what you feel good about in the news coverage 
 Uh-huh 
 Well I myself the reason why I listen to N P R and the reason why I watch MACNEIL LEHRER rather than the network news shows at night although I do watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories is that quite often it seems to me the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis
 The local doesn't either 
 but I feel that MACNEIL LEHRER get a little more deeply into some of the issues that are really current
 And perhaps newspapers do that 
 but as I said I don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper 
 and frankly when I have read a newspaper I haven't noticed that kind of analysis either
 So there is some danger to that of course too 
 Because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then you know how good is it 
 But I like a little more indepth coverage 
 and I think that's what maybe appealing to you too on something like TWENTY TWENTY or FORTY-EIGHT HOURS 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world rather than simply being aware you know there that an event has occurred 
 I like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture 
 Maybe because I'm easily confused by detail 
 I don't know 
 So 
 When 
 you have young children right
 So those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the T V set for awhile without interruption 
 you do 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 When is your good watching time
 Uh-huh 
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 that's what 
 I have older children and getting dinner on the table 
 I come from the east coast 
 and I was 
 it amazed me when I got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time they still watch the news when
