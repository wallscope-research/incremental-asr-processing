 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Do you usually go out with the children or without them
 Right 
 Yes
 Yes
 Yes
 Well 
 well we don't have any children 
 so we tend to like to try all sorts of different things 
 And we're very attracted to exotic food
 And we like Indian food and Thai cuisine and sort of gourmet Mexican and things like that as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and Chinese and things and things of that sort 
 Now yes 
 of course we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that too 
 And we probably go out one to two times a week
 And we're pretty much regulars at an local Italian restaurant
 Momo's
 Uh-huh
 I've heard about it 
 I haven't been in there
 Uh-huh
 that's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me 
 I like different kinds of food 
 So when we go out I'm always looking for something other than the standard menu even if it's a Mexican Restaurant like something other than you know the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and fajitas now 
 Yes 
 yes 
 and once in a while things backfire 
 I mean we've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food and things like that 
 And I'm not fond of some of those things 
 but we'll try anything
 we've had Ethiopian And not in Plano of course 
 But we really do enjoy going out 
 and I'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally backfires
 Yeah 
 I think we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or what attracts us to a restaurant 
 How do you usually find a new restaurant
 Uh-huh 
 So do we
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 We have found a number of restaurants either through D the Friday paper and sometimes the OBSERVER Which my husband usually picks up And also through coupons 
 When a new restaurant opens up they usually send out coupons
 And you know when they say you know buy one get one free It's hard to resist
 so we'll go in 
 And very often we'll find a place that we like 
 and we'll stick with it 
 once they no longer give coupons we'll stay there
 But we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons and the other half through the newspaper reviews
 I mean it's wonderful particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that 
 It's very expensive to go out to eat
 So yeah 
 that is really one of our 
 it's almost a hobby with us
 Yes
 Yes
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 absolutely
 And do the dishes 
 yes
 my sister who also lives here in Dallas tends to chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty
 but 
 What's your favorite restaurant
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 You know we've never been there
 And that's supposed to be wonderful
 
 Uh-huh
 Ooh
 Uh-huh
 I would probably like that 
 One or two times in my life I've ever had venison I've loved it 
 But you know it's just not 
 I don't know people who hunt 
 so 
 
 that's supposed to be a wonderful place 
 here in Plano well we tend to go to Momo's fairly often 
 And sometimes we'll go you know 
 we also go to Chili's and Colter's Bar B Q 
 and there is a little Thai place that's over on Park that we go to 
 My husband particularly likes that 
 We go into Dallas a lot because we're both were from the Richardson North Dallas area up until fairly recently 
 And we'll go down to Blue Mesa Grill Mexican food 
 and
