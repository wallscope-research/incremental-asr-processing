 I really haven't seen any movies lately 
 so when the computer picked this one I was a little bit surprised 
 but I think I haven't been to the movie theater here in about six months 
 but you know the last movies that I've seen were probably on video 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 now I haven't seen THE TERMINATOR movie 
 and that's kind of blood and guts isn't it 
 I don't particularly care for that sort of stuff
 Yeah 
 right
 Yeah 
 he maims them pretty good doesn't he
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I saw SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY 
 I saw it 
 couple weeks ago I rented it and watched it 
 and I was pretty disappointed in it 
 because I was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense
 and I was pretty disappointed in it
 Now it's a good movie 
 but I guess that they built me up too much For my expectations in it there
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Now I haven't seen it either 
 but I've heard that it's real long That it's a good movie but it's long like three hours
 That's right
 That's right
 OSCAR
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I know my daughter saw that 
 and she liked it 
 so 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And of course I get to watch all these movies like LOOK WHO'S TALKING and LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO 
 because I have a ten year old 
 so we watch a lot of movies around that category you know that she can watch 
 Yeah 
 We seen THE LITTLE MERMAID too
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 And I think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video SHIPWRECKED
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 it's fixing to come out on video 
 and boy I can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out
 But 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Well I'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's right *[[slash error]] And then they go to the dollar movies
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that does sound fun
 Right
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Golly 
 I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie
 that's the one where they burn down the house or something
 the house explodes
 okay
 Okay 
 yeah 
 Another movie that I want to see if it ever comes out on video so I can see it without my daughter around is 
 I just forgot the title of it 
 it's supposed to be a real scary one 
 darn 
 well here's another one that I've seen 
 I saw 
 I can't remember the title of it either
