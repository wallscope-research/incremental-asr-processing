 No 
 I do not
 Do you
 Have I
 no 
 not actually 
 Okay
 Right
 Okay
 Right 
 I think that job wise benefits are just as important as salary is
 Exactly
 exactly
 Especially when you have a family with children and you are always going to the doctor for 
 Exactly
 they always do
 Yeah 
 I think even if your insurance policy is not the greatest 
 Exactly 
 you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time just by yourself 
 Also for working women I think a lot of the companies should start providing for day-care in the building
 Right
 Yeah
 Like in may case I have three children *[[spelling: 'may' should be 'my']] from ages nine to two And it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that I would be making would be going to day care
 And it would be just 
 basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care center 
 Exactly
 Besides which it would be easier there's a lot of single mothers out there now from divorces and a lot of women are starting to have babies without a partner
 And to go to work you are worried about your child besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care
 And if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place 
 and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child you know and take your breaks with your children or something
 I think tha- 
 I think it would be fair
 I think if the company could not provide it all on their own for the people that would be using it you know a certain amount of their salary would go to it
 But it would still probably be cheaper with the company helping if everybody you know pulled their own weight in it
 I think it would be really really great
 Yeah
 I do
 Eye care is good 
 I do not 
 I am not sur- 
 I do not think we have that on our policy
 But we 
 Yeah
 It would be great I mean the glasses that 
 the exams themselves are not expensive it's the glasses
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Right 
 now like my 
 Right
 Well like my mother she has to go for testing cause she has got 
 Well she does not have it 
 but she is like on the verge of it or something 
 Her eyes are changing
 and she has to be tested periodically 
 and those are expensive tests
 Now I think your insurance covers her on that 
 but you know for something like that that's just as bad as a medical you know 
 that's 
 Right
 Right
 Now I would like to see better dental insurance to me 
 Was that our beep
 Oh 
 Huh
 Okay
 But with the three children orthopedic care not orthopedic orthodontic care 
 because on a lot of the dental insurance they do not cover that well 
 For the orthodontia stuff 
 Yes 
 it is
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Right 
 My middle child needs to have orthodontic because his his pallet is squared not rounded/
 And it affects his speech a little bit not anything you know 
 Right
 But just enough that his bite is off a little bit 
 and it's like four hundred dollars 
 and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it
 Oh
 Really
 That sounds like it would hurt more
 gosh
 I would much rather do that to myself than make my five year old go in and do it
 That would kill me
