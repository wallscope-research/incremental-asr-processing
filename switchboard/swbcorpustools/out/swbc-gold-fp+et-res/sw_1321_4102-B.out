 Well I think uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for
 They've got a lot of special needs 
 and at the same time uh the majority of them don't want to give up the independence that they have
 
 And so you've got a real balance to make there
 What about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 {very faint}
 
 Oh really
 Oh okay
 Yeah 
 but it gets hard 
 My my grandmother is in her mid eighties
 and she's uh suffering from uh well uh progressive Alzheimer's Disease
 so she doesn't remember anybody
 and uh she remembers things 
 but they are things back whenever she was real young
 and so with 
 she was living by herself 
 but my uh uncle has moved in with her to take care of her
 and it's creating a lot of problems
 Oh yes 
 Yes
 In Dallas 
 uh yeah 
 I've I've heard of several things 
 and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them 
 but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or uh to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up
 Right
 Oh really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Well it it's it's a really day care programs are really neat you know 
 and if the if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that that is one of the best things to do 
 but I think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them 
 and I think that's in a way it's more some an area where some of the day care uh programs have left off 
 because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those
 Right 
 Cause I know there's one not too far from from me here in Dallas 
 Uh and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work and sports
 But if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly 
 Yeah 
 you can't do it
 Well that's true
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And they love to recollect 
 I mean they just you know 
 and they will just go on and on with these stories 
 and they have such a memory
 My grandmother doesn't 
 She she wants to te- to tell you about her story over again 
 so 
 which is fine you know 
 so
