 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well mostly right now I do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible 
 we're about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff
 so 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Fun for them
 I've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three
 Yeah 
 Well this is a friend's party 
 and they rented 
 or you know they 
 the party 
 they just rent skates and stuff for the kids
 So they're looking forward to it
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 So 
 how long have you lived in North Carolina
 Really
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Really
 W- 
 did you like Oklahoma while you were there
 what did you all do
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Really
 So is he working there then 
 or 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well how did you get hooked up with the T I switchboard thing
 Uh-huh
 I see 
 I see
 Uh-huh 
 W- 
 my wife has talked more than I have 
 she's talked to four five different people 
 It seems like she hasn't talked to anybody from Dallas 
 In fact she's talked to a couple of people from North Carolina I think 
 Yeah
 Her name's Tina 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 W- 
 the call was probably for her 
 They wouldn't accept my T I N number 
 so we put hers in 
 But like I said we're getting the kids ready to go to the birthday party
 so 
 But some of 
 yeah 
 I've only talked to one or two 
 and they've all been in Dallas 
 But she hasn't talked to anybody in Dallas yet 
 So that's interesting
 Well the sport I like best probably is basketball 
 But I guess I'm probably better at softball 
 And so I'd 
 like during the summer months it's occupies quite a bit of my time 
 But I play in a couple of leagues and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend 
 But my family usually goes with me 
 We try to do everything we can together
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well they 
 a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams we 
 that's usually the team I play on with the tournaments and stuff 
 and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age 
 So they play together pretty well 
 and 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 pretty much 
 And Tina enjoys the other lady real well 
 So they 
 you know that's kind of nice 
 It's like getting together with them 
 So to speak 
 Yeah 
 Well it's been raining a lot here so far 
 So we haven't really had any kind of real heat 
 I think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon we were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in the house 
 So it looks like an air conditioner day 
 But 
 Yeah 
 It 
 yeah 
 but you know I'm sure you're familiar with that living here 
 we go through Enid you know quite a bit 
 We go to Tulsa from time to time 
 And my parents live in southern Illinois 
 So we drive up there 
 And well lot of times we take seventy-five 
 and it seems like that goes through Enid I know
 I've either seen the signs or 
 I know I've seen the sign somewhere
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 So how l- 
 you said you've just lived in North Carolina just like six months then is 
 And you really like it there 
 I've heard so many people talk about that area 
 I've never been there
 
 but they sure say it's pretty 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It really does 
 My wife and I spent a couple years doing church work up in the state of Washington right on the coast 
 And it rains you know a lot there 
 But you get used to it 
 I mean it's like a fine mist all the time 
 and it doesn't really 
 it gets to where it doesn't bother you
 Really
 It 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 That's the way it was there too 
 uh-huh
 But 
 Well I have enjoyed talking to you too 
 It was nice to talk to you
 I hope you enjoy North Carolina 
 *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 *[[slash error]] Well I hope I live through it
 That's what I hope 
 Okay 
 Thanks a lot
 Good-bye
