 Jimmy so how do you get most of your news
 wow 
 So when you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when
 okay 
 Well I would probably be a junkie or watch C N N a lot 
 but I don't subscribe to cable because of the poor service and also because 
 well I give to the United Way 
 and so I figured that amount of money I just donate to that
 Yeah 
 I take away a addiction 
 something
 Well I 
 
 what newspapers do you read
 Uh-huh 
 For a while there I subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES actually a couple of newspapers because you know my fiance 
 well she was unemployed for a while 
 so she you know really needed to look at the help wanted ads
 and so often the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of news 
 And I don't know 
 NEW YORK TIMES is okay 
 and when you read a lot of this stuff the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so

 I guess it's still a lot of hype 
 Look at the Smith trial
 I mean that was a joke
 yeah 
 the N P R doing that 
 yeah 
 I know 
 I had some visitor 
 and he was just I don't know fixated on that you know just listened to it constantly 
 and I guess that's good when it's live if you'll really want that
 but that's not really providing you news
 it's more like a media event rather than reporting
 really 
 That's kind of boring to me I think
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I guess that's true 
 But one of the ways that I get information is every day when I log in on the computer I subscribe to this thing 
 it's free inside the company 
 it's called INTELLECT 
 and they basically type out abstracts which are really literally 
 I've actually read the actual articles 
 they're pretty g-
