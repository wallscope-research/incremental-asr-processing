 Atlanta is kind of high 
 it's lower than it has been in the past 
 I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off 
 and usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher
 Yeah 
 what kind of crime problem do you usually run into 
 Any specifics <>
 
 Right 
 well I guess here we run into that sometime 
 but I guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins that type not much home break ins 
 There are some but not very high 
 as far as tellers and things like that it's not extremely high either 
 There were one case where this one guy was taking women from the teller and you know making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them all 
 so that's kind of like a double assault there
 Really
 Uh-huh
 wow
 Yeah 
 there's a crime
 Uh-huh
 okay 
 I don't know 
 crime situations here they 
 like I say lot of cases is usually just apartments and break ins and things like that 
 and a lot of it is due to drugs drug related you know in most cases 
 it's not like it's someone do steal a or television or V C R or something like that 
 it is for drugs you know because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se you know 
 you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it
 so you really not making a sizeable profit 
 So it's not really lucrative to take chances like that you know even though it does exist
 Right 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 but you'd be surprised also how much people watch you that even not participating in any type crime 
 I guess there was one case 
 I was surprised 
 so happened this person worked at the same place 
 I work for Georgia Tech 
 and they work at the same place I did 
 but I didn't know that they had been watching me 
 because I was getting ready to go in my car one morning 
 and the first thing they said is you must don't have to be to work at eight you know 
 like shock
