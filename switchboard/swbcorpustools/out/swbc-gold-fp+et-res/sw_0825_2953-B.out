 Well 
 my goodness 
 Now see we think of classic rock that they you know have on all the easy listening stations now as our heart and soul 
 I mean it was 
 that is a really good question because that was everything from the Rolling Stones to the Beatles 
 I mean we were there
 Yeah 
 I was 
 Well I was in seventh grade when the Beatles came out
 I was fourteen years old
 Woodstock 
 Well I wanted to go 
 I was in Chicago 
 And I guess I was close to eighteen or something 
 I 
 it was like I think the summer between my high school and college Somewhere around in there
 I can't quite remember the year 
 And 
 yeah
 we could not get it together to drive 
 I mean you know we had never driven outside of you know ten miles out of town at that time 
 And here we were all hep to go to Woodstock you know
 I really do 
 You 
 It would have been incredible 
 I think of you know all the social changes that were going on around that time and the sixties as being so revolutionary in a lot of ways in terms of raising people's consciousness Everything from 
 well I mean I remember we had the first Earth Day back then you know
 we got out of school at the university 
 and we celebrated Earth Day
 Yeah 
 Planted trees and stuff 
 and we did not realize you know the implications of all that then and a lot of the stuff that goes on today 
 Well Well you do 
 You'll 
 y- 
 I mean there was no name to it 
 It was everything that was started in the sixties 
 you had to fight for racial equality
 And busing themsel- 
 It was like just a continuum 
 You know everything sort of had a seed in the sixties
 And women's rights I mean things for women were totally different for you by that time
 You just assume 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well we learned from KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER didn't we 
 It seems unfair
 But it 
 see men are coming into their own now too
 Yeah
 Well are you married 
 and do you have children
 Two kids 
 and how does your husband respond to all the new social changes
 Well see bless his heart you know 
 They are going to be back in style any day now
 Oh 
 Yeah
 Oh 
 Well see that is the spirit of the sixties 
 And whether we are talking about the rain forests 
 I tell 
 you know the situation you have right now 
 and all of our generations is what to do with the children Because both mother and father have to work now
 okay
 see that is your commitment
 You do not know what you are changing when you do something like that
 You do not understand the total commitment it takes to be a parent
 
 Uh-huh
 That one person that you could always count on being there
 Well 
 They definitely do
 They definitely do 
 I 
 well see if I had some I would 
 I have not 
 I had an unfortunate thing happen 
 and I am you know 
 and it is not going to happen that way
 But my friends are having babies right and left 
 so I get to see the different ways that they all raise them 
 and one gal she started a business in her home 
 And she hired an au pair which is a college kid to come in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the house
 And the guy lives in with her you know
 I mean you know it is a family sort of unit sort of thing 
 and the 
 And so 
 So that is a different way 
 And then my other girlfriend just you know tears her hair out and goes at it you know twenty-four hours a day watching both kids all the time 
 And I think there is a point where you just have to get away
 And it is good for the kid 
 and it is good for you to develop you know your interest so you do not stop growing at the same time
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Do you have any 
 do you have your mom or anybody around you that helps you 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Right 
 Well that is 
 Well see and that is the sort of the thing of the nineties is women working out of their own home
 Right
 And I think you know the more we try to you know shape that the more input we have into what that whole system is going to look like Because that is our choice now too 
 that is our cause
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 
 Being there all the time
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 See the economic situation on the whole thing 
 And then well it is 
 see we do have things that we are concerned about here
 This generation 
 I don't know 
 Social change is always going to go on 
 but I think we have taken a big leap in the last you know twenty thirty years
 And nothing is the same
 Well 
 Yeah 
 But we passed them on to you you know 
 I mean 
 I said "We passed them on to you"
 I mean you know because it takes a lot of hard work 
 It takes writing letters to Congressmen and you know just being very very politically astute about how to shape and mold the future 
 and you know did we make the right choices 
 We do not know 
 we will never know
 I mean you know I think we made a wrong choice when I look at the children of today 
 Yeah 
 I think we made some big wrong choices
 And I think business got in the way 
 I think the greed of the eighties got
