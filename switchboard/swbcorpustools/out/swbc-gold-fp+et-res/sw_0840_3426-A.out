 All right 
 I like keep forgetting to make these calls 
 I've been on this list for two months
 I think I've made four calls 
 Right
 Well there are some kind of nice prizes 
 and it's worth doing it 
 I so mad I think I've had this for two months 
 and like I've made four calls 
 and lot of times we don't answer the phone probably when I get mine early in the evening 
 Well we're supposed to talk about movies 
 Have you been to any lately
 I haven't really seen one since probably August because every weekend in the Fall we go to our high school football game on Friday then we go out with friends after 
 and that's kind of the our social for the 
 But I saw ROBIN HOOD which I didn't care for
 No 
 and my husband dragged me to it
 like I think Kevin Costner's a nice fellow 
 and he's nice looking 
 but he just to me is not a very dynamic actor
 I guess because he is good looking 
 I don't know 
 I don't know 
 Oh 
 I saw CITY SLICKERS 
 Did you see 
 that was a 
 That's the last one I saw I think
 I did too 
 I thought that was so cute 
 and I do too
 I really enjoyed that
 Right
 Which most of them probably aren't 
 I don't know what my kids see any more 
 My kids are twenty and sixteen 
 so they've probably seen about everything at this point 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 I know it
 That's the way it is 
 We can see some pretty raunchy stuff on just regular T V without cable or anything You know
 there's no way to protect them any more
 So 
 No 
 it'll teach a great lesson because she ended up in so 
 But it was a fun movie to watch
 the scary one
 I didn't see that 
 but the 
 really
 I like scary ones that are realistic
 They say is really frightening too
 the new one that came out
 They say it's really horrifyingly scary
 but I'd never get my husband to that 
 He doesn't like to be scared 
 and my kids both saw that 
 They liked it
 And it was still scary no 
 Gosh
 no 
 that one sounded gross 
 I know my husband wouldn't have stood for that
 he likes MARY POPPINS and things 
 Yeah 
 I do too 
 I really like a variety
 Where are you from
 I was going to s- 
 well my husband's from New Jersey 
 and we lived there for five years when we first got married
 and so it sound kind of nice 
 it was familiar your accent
 Oh
 Right
 I don't know up there
 Just 
 different 
 uh-huh
 Well see the accents up there fascinated me because even in his family alone there were several different accents the way they would pronounce words differently
 and his family they lived in the same house there 
 most of them were twenty or so you know
 Yeah
 uh-huh 
 and they lived you know 
 they never moved into apartments when they were young 
 they always stayed at home until they got married 
 it seemed to be the custom up there 
 Or they went in the service 
 and so they were together for all that time 
 But they still 
 their accents differed a little in the family
 and it 
 in the sixties
 I finally
 yeah 
 I converted him to being a Texan 
 I just thought life would be 
 I knew it was easier back here
 Well sort of 
 I'm an Air Force brat 
 but I was real familiar with Texas 
 I went to college here and everything
 And I just thought you know we could probably get a better house 
 and life is a little slower a little easier
 He loves it 
 he really would never want to leave 
 so it worked out
 Not hard when you first came
 Was it hard when you first came
 my

 compared to New York 
 yes

 I have a friend down the street's from New Jersey 
 and they were
