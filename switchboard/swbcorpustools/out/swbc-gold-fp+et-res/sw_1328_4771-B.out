 Right
 Well tha- that's true 
 Actually down here we don't have a big problem with uh with air pollution 
 Mainly because we don't have anybody to th- to either side of us 
 Uh which helps out a lot as far as that goes 
 I wouldn't even necessarily thought of that except when I lived up in Boston and up in uh you know 
 debates would come up up there in Massachusetts and you know in that area over uh air pollution 
 and their attitude's basically well prevailing ins winds are to the east 
 so why should we have to worry
 Oh yes 
 nothing 
 Right
 Oh absolutely 
 yeah 
 just muggy 
 So yes 
 I think 
 yeah 
 I think you're right 
 Our most pollute substance down here is just water 
 But I I I I think you know the biggest causes even then a lot of times are uh uh like when I was up in Boston just all the cars You know just all over the place 
 You just got a lot of you know a lot of pollution from those 
 and uh you know if you don't have a wind it sticks around
 Absolutely
 Right
 That's that's very true
 Uh you know of course then when when you're not recycling you've got these incendiary plants and stuff that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere 
 But I you know you've got you've got the industry 
 you've got that 
 and you got the cars 
 I think the cars are where where it's at right now as far as pollution goes air pollution I mean
 Right
 I guess so
 Right 
 I you know I don't know in the air what they do 
 Uh I I haven't run across any major pollutants down there that I've I've really seen a lot of you know upsettedness about 
 Uh I I know I've seen like uh 
 my grandparents live in Corpus Christi Texas 
 and I know they've there's a lot of refineries down there 
 and that that's some pretty potent stuff they put up in the air 
 I but I don't know how uh you know 
 there's a difference in what you can smell and what you uh you know what's bad
