 What do you think
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think that the corporations should do all that 
 They should have drug screening before they hire an employee 
 and any time that an employee 
 like if they're coming to late work all the time and especially if they're on the line or any kind of sensitive job where you know if they made a mistake it would cost a lot of money or people's lives *[[ slash ]] Then they need to be watched carefully 
 *[[ slash ]] so *[[slash]] Right
 *[[slash should be aa]] Yeah 
 yeah 
 but you got to have a safe work place 
 That's all there is to it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I think it's more frequent now 
 It's probably like forty fifty percent
 Yeah
 Because all the jobs that I've applied for have mentioned some type of drug screening
 You know *[[slash error]] I work at Sears
 And I just do warehouse work
 not 
 they hired me in nineteen eighty-four 
 so *[[slash error]] Yeah
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] But now they issued a statement about that about three months ago
 not that I know of 
 It was more about all the people's problems 
 Like they've been laying off a lot of people
 and they sent out the employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem
 Family problems you know They kind of covered everything
 But I know they have a lot of drug problems 
 so 
 Yes 
 I do
 because you know they're hypocritical 
 they talk against drugs
 and then they get caught you know
 In stings in Washington
 *[[one utt with a61]] Whether it's drugs or any other kind of 
 like the money laundering scams All that was drug related
 and that cost us the country you know billions of dollars
 So
