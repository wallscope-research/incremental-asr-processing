 Uh-huh
 How do you feel about them I mean since you've kind of been close to that
 Uh-huh
 Well I've had a touch of experience 
 My dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him 
 and she put him in 
 but he wasn't there very long before he died
 but I guess the one time that I saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay
 But we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time
 and that's always kind of bothered me
 Uh-huh
 I have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home 
 but I've never actually been there
 and I know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow you know a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about
 But still I'm sure there are you know aspects to it that aren't really desirable
 Yeah
 Well sometimes you don't have any other alternative
 well family's tied up with their own lives and things and usually working 
 and it's hard to 
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 I think that's important too 
 in fact there's a 
 Yes
 There's one close to where my mother is 
 but in order to get in you have to be able to walk in on your own 
 in other words you can't be in you know too bad a shape to start out with
 But then if you deteriorate they have a separate section for those who need care you know all the time
 But it's always well 
 and they have a long waiting list too 
 So there's always this feeling of well golly gee you know you've got to be able to walk in the door 
 so you can't wait until you're too bad off
 but then you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because like you have to give up your automobile or whatever
 Yeah 
 and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like well gee you know I'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment
 So that's a hard one 
 but it is a very nice nursing home
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's the problem
 the expense of it all is 
 and another thing I hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately
 But those who don't have money can go in and get the same care You know 
 So I don't like that aspect
 Yeah
 That's right
 Well yeah 
 I've talked to my mother about that several times lately 
 and I said I want you to have control of your own business
 But you know what if
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 my mother's seventy-five and still has her own home and everything
 Yeah
 That's true 
 They have a lot of people around to do things with
 Some of those places have wonderful activities and things you know lots of stuff going on
 And they'll take them places
 so I don't know 
 it's not all bad
 but I guess once you get ill then you know you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things
 No
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That might be kind of tough 
 Well you too
 Okay
 Bye
