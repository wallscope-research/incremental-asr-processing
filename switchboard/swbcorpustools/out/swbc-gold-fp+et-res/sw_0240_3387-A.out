 Well I don't know what to do about the federal budget 
 there certainly have been ideas surfaced recently matter of fact repeatedly by many people 
 and I sort of wondered what thoughts you had on that area
 Uh-huh
 Now are you talking about the elected people 
 or are you talking about others 
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 I'm not sure how you would ach- 
 how would you achieve that 
 I mean if 
 So you would trust the decision making economists
 Sometimes called the dismal science
 Uh-huh 
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yes
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists 
 I mean right now lobbyists require to register you'd just say make them all 
 No causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 So you talk about jeopardizing the future 
 Would you be against any deficit spending
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 But what practical steps could one take 
 Well but everybody will say that he is for that 
 and and how will you make that actually happen
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yep 
 Sounds like a good idea
 Nothing escapes right 
 no deductions nothing
 Just ten percent 
 Yep
 Right
 Yep 
 So that's it 
 That's I mean 
 I agree with that 
 that's a good idea 
 and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or lower them or what
