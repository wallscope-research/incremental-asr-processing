 think about this 
 I do 
 
 So you see a big difference then in before and now do you 
 or 
 A lot of testing
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I do too 
 I think that's awful
 I know 
 What's the new criteria 
 We have all kinds of testing 
 and it's over and over 
 It's I T B S and just everything 
 And they test test test 
 I live in Plano actually 
 and I don't know if you've heard of Plano 
 but it's a very transient community 
 A lot of people from everywhere 
 it's just north of Dallas
 and it's grown in leaps and bounds 
 we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now
 And most of them from other places 
 J C Penney's come down from New York and of course T I and Xerox from Rochester 
 and we just have lots of people from everywhere Lots of industry coming in
 and it's a very wealthy community 
 not that I am 
 but other people seem to be 
 and I would love to know why 
 but I mean they do 
 They have 
 I would 
 I really would 
 I mean they just have beautiful beautiful homes 
 and they have everything 
 The kids only wear name brand things to school 
 and it's one of these things 
 Well it does you know 
 It really does because I'm a single mom and I have a thirteen year old now 
 and you know it does
 I mean we do it to a point 
 but not to where she feels different 
 but some of them are very rich 
 and so we just kind of have everything here 
 and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are
 And so I don't know how much of it is us and how much of it is Texas 
 but the kids are expected to excel in everything
 And it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first 
 and they're expected to be 
 You know their parents expect it 
 the teachers expect it 
 Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system
 and if you read national surveys they're far from it 
 And so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests 
 Well not very well 
 They bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before tests 
 I mean they make a big deal 
 To me the paper should just be put on the desk that day 
 and say just do this
 You know I just feel they do better that way
 And 
 Yeah 
 and I have older children too that now are out of high school 
 and they've always done this here 
 I mean it's always been the same 
 but it's getting worse and worse 
 is more pressure for everything 
 *[[listen]] And I just think it's really awful 
 and I'm with you on that 
 You don't hear too many people say this 
 but I think it's a very long day
 And my feeling is that you know you're only a kid once and you don't want to spend your whole life in school
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 And I don't think that's right 
 I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system
 I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano 
 I would like to see those things included in our school system because I think we should have well-rounded kids not just book smart kids
 And so I just find this a real problem 
 I think if they're going to be there all day they should find time 
 One of my daughters once was out of school with Mono in her junior year I think it was 
 And she had a home teacher for like four hours a week 
 and when she went back in six weeks she was ahead 
 So what does that tell you 
 It tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time
 And they could be using this time better
 Uh-huh
 That's a very long day for kindergartners 
 But I think that working parents have kind of demanded this
 You know because they don't want to send them to daycare 
 That's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day 
 We have them at one school like
