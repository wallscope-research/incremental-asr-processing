 Anyway 
 What do I do 
 at the moment it's under chaos 
 right now I'm just 
 I don't really have a budget per se 
 it's called living within your means You know which means at the moment paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse 
 but no 
 I don't really have a budget at the moment 
 but I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month 
 and then I usually don't exceed that unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if I have car expenses 
 and then it goes through the moon 
 so 
 Yeah 
 so what do yo- 
 So you can afford to get a house
 Yeah
 Yeah
 So what do you and your husband do
 Are you really
 
 No kidding

 Overseas where would you be going

 Yes 
 I know who they are

 you know there was a fairly large building well that belongs to them 
 So are you active in translation
 Uh-huh 
 True 
 true enough 
 So what languages do you speak besides English of course
 Uh-huh <>
 In ] France
 
 Must have been terrible 
 The 
 was it Henry Macon said that the language was like a man slowly bleeding to death 
 So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die 
 and it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that 
 Free style English is just 
 takes on
