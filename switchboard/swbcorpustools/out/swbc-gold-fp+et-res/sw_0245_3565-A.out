 you've done 
 Well how did it go
 Gee like starting over I guess 
 
 Uh-huh 
 Boy that sounds like 
 course I don't know 
 once you get it done then you probably won't have that problem again
 you've got an older house
 They are built a little bit more sturdy than 
 Right
 is that right
 Yes
 And just start at square one
 
 Well and then if you do it wrong 
 Everything went all right 
 That's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens
 Right
 Yes
 Right
 All worked out all right 
 well probably the last thing I did was paint and wallpaper kids room
 and I learned to 
 I used the wrong kind of paint 
 This must have not been a very good quality because it just hasn't stood up very well
 It was a latex paint 
 it was flat
 and I wonder if maybe I should have used a gloss 
 but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your kitchens and things like that
 Yeah 
 but I think maybe 
 I don't know if it was just the 
 Well it is a latex paint 
 but it just kind of is 
 you know so you're supposed to be able to wash it
 but it just looks dingy 
 I don't know how else to explain it

 but

 and it's a small room

 and then they add the color
 You know what I'm saying 
 but 
 Yes
 Right 
 And then I wall papered a couple of walls 
 and 
 Well that was the first time I've ever wallpapered 
 and 
 That's an education in itself
 But the dye lots must have been a little bit different from 
 first of all it takes quite a few rolls even a small room if you're trying to match a design
 Yes
 That's what I needed 
 and I didn't think about that 
 I got a Mickey Mouse print is what I got
 And so a lot is wasted
 So you know how 
 See I didn't even think to look for that
 And then the 
 one of them was just a different color pink is what it ended up being
 And 
 No 
 I didn't
 Is that how you're supposed to do 
 I started at one edge and went over 
 then you had to cut around the closet and cut around a window
 but 
 And start right there 
 Do you seem to get it straighter 
 is that the advantage 
 or what's the
