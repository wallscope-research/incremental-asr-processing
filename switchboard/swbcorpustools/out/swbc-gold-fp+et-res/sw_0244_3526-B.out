 Hi 
 well I guess 
 which one have you got right now 
 Or 
 my 
 just a couple
 I've got an Omega 
 and I've got a generic three eighty or four eighty-six machine
 Yeah 
 it's very very generic
 Yeah 
 and upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled 
 and now it's a fast machine 
 That's all I got to say for it
 Huh
 work 
 I'm a contract programmer
 anything 
 I've done business programming you know scientific applications like you know petroleum science stuff and test equipment 
 and I did one that was the demonstration of a touch screen for a company that sells touch screens 
 It was kind of fun
 Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display And make it look like things like you know attack simulators and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for
 yeah 
 definitely
 yeah 
 unfortunately the little portable P C that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz eighty-six 
 It's like slow <>
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I know a guy that upgrades for a reasonable cost
 his name is T Q or something like that 
 And my notebook is somewhere around here 
 See if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough
 he's up in 
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 that works
 here it is 
 A T S Computers
 Uh-huh
 do you know where Custer is
 Okay 
 he's south of Renner on Custer
 And there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like strip kind of center
 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 it's just south of there
 It's a little place looks like a castle
 Kind of little guy in there 
 he gives reasonable prices
 Like I traded my three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred
 Yeah 
 it was pretty reasonable
 But he 
 and he does a good job 
 and he guarantees everything he sells
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 they're up there in that mall just below Campbell Or that strip center
 They're still doing business Big business apparently
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I was amazed I was able to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in 
 you know it's like wow 
 That works 
 I'll go do that 
 And boy that thing screams now
 Uh-huh 
 Well I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the price difference is about ten dollars
 Yeah 
 when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks
 Yeah
