 You said you have four cats
 How old are they
 gosh
 I haven't had my oldest one quite nine years 
 I've had him probably five years
 yes 
 I love my cats 
 I lost one one time 
 the first one I got 
 He jumped off the balcony actually of a second story apartment
 And he'd never been outside like you know by himself outside
 And it started raining 
 and I was hysterical 
 I was 
 I mean you would have thought a child had died
 I called everyone I knew 
 I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat
 And they laughed at me 
 they thought that was so hysterical
 yeah
 The cat was here first 
 so I know 
 it's hard
 how funny
 That's sweet 
 I have the two 
 the other two cats I have are outdoor cats
 And they didn't used to be actually 
 but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside 
 so I put them outside once I got a house 
 and they're doing great out there 
 they love it 
 But the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there
 Other than that he gets scared to death 
 If you shut that door he goes into hiding
 I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony 
 And Lord knows what happened to him 
 He's probably been through all kinds of nightmares
 Probably
 Are they
 no
 my gosh
 I imagine
 I wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened
 I can imagine 
 what did he shoot him with
 my gosh 
 People are crazy
 Lord
 man
 I imagine 
 They usually are after something like that happens to them 
 It seems to mellow them or something
 No
 yeah 
 I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I can't take care of them as well because they're outside
 and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back
 and I feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things 
 But I can't give them up
 I go hysterical when they don't come home
 yeah 
 and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat
 And you go crazy thinking it might be yours
 Uh-huh
 Ugh
 Really
 It's here now 
 we have to keep it 
 Yeah 
 my first one that I got 
 I had just moved away from home and got my own apartment 
 It took me about two weeks to realize that was real lonely
 So I found this one 
 and actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive-thru that said free kittens
 And I thought well that's interesting
 I'll call them
 And he was the only one left 
 and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens
 And he was the last one she carried across you know 
 the whole big sad story
 So of course I had to take him 
 I felt so sorry for him after that
 And you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers
 Yeah 
 he 
 I asked the vet why he did that 
 and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed 
 so 
 But he is the lovingest cat 
 people who don't even like cats like him
 He never meows 
 he doesn't have any front claws 
 I had him declawed
 but he doesn't bite anybody 
 he's just kind of there real friendly and docile
 yeah 
 yeah 
 we call that doing biscuits
 it looks like their kneading bread 
 *[[spelling "their" should be "they're"]] I just love cats 
 I like dogs 
 they're okay 
 I had a dog when I lived at home 
 but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually
 yeah 
 they do
 they are 
 I love it 
 it's so funny to get more than one cat together because it brings out their personalities
 And they just act so funny
 Really
 Uh-huh
 A train of cats running around
 how funny 
 I can imagine 
 Yeah 
 I wouldn't give anything for my cats 
 I love them to death
 What are your cats' names
 how sweet
 I have Xanadu and Precious and Rascal
 Precious and Rascal are brother and sister 
 and they don't look a thing a like 
 Nothing 
 Precious is a medium hair yellow cat
 and Rascal is a black and white short hair
 They don't look a thing a like 
 and they came from the same litter and everything
 Oh
 So ugly she's cute 
 right
 Really
 Oh
 Is she the oldest one
 Really
 I know 
 it's like the end of the world
 I know that's how I am about Xanadu
 definitely
 Yeah
 You can walk a dog 
 and that's okay for weekend 
 but cats are good all the time
 It wouldn't have 
 no 
 that would be a problem 
 Have you seen those 
 do you ever read COSMO 
 There was cartoon in COSMO about a year or two ago 
 and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date 
 and there were cats hanging all over him Hanging on his clothes you know 
 they had ripped him up 
 and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom 
 he said of course I love cats
 And they were just all over him and sitting on his head the whole nine yards 
 It was so funny
 Watch me
 Definitely
 I wouldn't either 
 There'd be no way
 really 
 well 
 That's life 
 that's how life goes
 I know 
 I love mine too 
 Well it's been nice talking to you
 Me to 
 Bye 
 bye
