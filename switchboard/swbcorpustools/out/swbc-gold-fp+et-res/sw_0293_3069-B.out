 Yeah 
 because 
 I've only made 
 this is only my third call
 I tried to make calls two different days 
 and I couldn't get through
 Does it 
 Yeah 
 I've been trying to you know do that 
 and sometimes I just can't wait that long
 so I just hang up Because it keeps going through the thing over and over again
 But I knew as soon as I heard your voice 
 I thought it's Kathy Kester 
 Well let's see 
 gosh I can't even think 
 I haven't read any 
 and you're such a reader I know that 
 and I 
 Yeah 
 the last book I picked up was a book by Judy Bloom
 and it was called SMART WOMEN I think or something like that
 And it was kind of 
 I really didn't like it at all
 it was written back in the early eighties
 And it was all this divorced woman syndrome of the 
 it was almost like a pre-AIDS scare kind of thing
 It was really an interesting 
 because I right away looked at when it was copyrighted Because I could tell by the theme almost when it was written
 And it was all about women searching for themselves *[[two utts]] And you know a lot of hanky-panky going on
 That's right
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 and she's more famous for that
 but she has been writing for adults also
 and so I thought hey I'll just try this you know and see what it was like 
 It was very 
 the style was very conversational
 You would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description
 You know how that is 
 and 
 Yeah 
 she has 
 because I remember seeing a new book by her that was out 
 and I think it was an adult book
 So anyway 
 but that's the last thing I've read
 and 
 Yeah
 I 
 WUTHERING HEIGHTS
 yeah 
 by Jane Austen 
 yes
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Because I think I read it in college or had to read it in high school or college 
 but I don't remember it
 And then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg I got her someone 
 I think it was some actress reading it
 You know they had an abridged version of it on tape
 And so I got that for her 
 and she loved doing that
 But I remember that was the book
 And now I mean I think it's around here somewhere
 I'm just going to have to put it in the car sometimes and listen to it
 But 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that's what I do too
 yeah 
 how neat 
 great 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 great 
 that's fascinating
 Oh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 it's a brand new book
 that would be wonderful to read something like that 
 Yeah 
 Yes
 Yeah 
 and they just went from generation probably to generation just with these all passing it from one to the other
 Yeah 
 that's the way it was I'm sure back then
 Yeah 
 that's interesting 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 Wow that's rough
 That's real rough 
 Yeah 
 Well that's a neat thing to be involved in *[[slash error]] Because I think my alma mater Gettysburg I think they were just starting a magazine *[[sd]] that was similar to that
 I think that's probably sort of a thing to do in small colleges
 but 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Oh
 Now translations what do you mean translations of 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 I see
 All different
 that's interesting
 Gosh 
 That's great
 Boy you really lift me up to a different 
 I mean here I'm dealing with cleaning the stove 
 and 
 You know I wish I were dealing with Baudelaire 
 That would be nice
