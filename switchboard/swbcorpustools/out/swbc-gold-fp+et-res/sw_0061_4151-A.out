 Do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore
 Uh-huh
 Of the statements made by people against the death penalty I like the statement made by Cuomo 
 Cuomo I believe is 
 he's governor of New York 
 but he's against the death penalty 
 But he said that he would want to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if they did something to his wife 
 And that's 
 but even in that situation he would hope that there would be people around him who would keep him from doing the things
 Right 
 exactly
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 See I don't think the decisions that are going to be made on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do 
 Are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who can't survive or that aren't conforming enough to society so that we work well together 
 Or are they 
 is it a penal institution 
 is it designed for punishment 
 the death penalty surely fits in well in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment 
 perhaps not in the manner that we do it 
 but in theory it fits in 
 in a reformatory I mean 
 if you put someone to death you obviously can't reform them
 So 
 Yeah 
 I don't think it's done 
 I don't think we run it as a deterrent 
 I mean people say that 
 but I mean if it was really a deterrent I mean I think like horse thieves in the old west you know 
 they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while 
 And if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent I would think that it would be public 
 I mean I don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever sees it 
 If someone ever 
 if you know 
 like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime had to sit and watch and see a guy burn or you know something or shot by a firing squad or something like that 
 I would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than you know telling them that there's protestors out here at the you know
