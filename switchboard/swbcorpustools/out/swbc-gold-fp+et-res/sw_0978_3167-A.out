 They suggested some sort of a recipe for company for entertaining 
 Did you have anything in mind that you'd like to share
 Ooh
 Oh
 Ooh that sounds good 
 What 
 Uh-huh
 One tablespoon of worcester
 Okay
 that 
 How much chili sauce did you say
 Like eight 
 Not eight ounces 
 That would be a lot
 Is it
 Okay 
 this would make a lot right
 And how much crab meat did you use
 One can of flake
 okay 
 Have you ever used the imitation yet
 Ooh that sounds 
 I've tried it 
 and then I have it here on hand for about a week 
 and then all of a sudden it dawned on me 
 wait is this totally imitation 
 and then I found out 
 I went back to the store 
 and they said it is a fish product
 So therefore you really don't have a very long life you know once you buy it
 I thought so you know they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is
 You know
 that's a good idea
 Whose was that
 Sam's 
 right 
 right
 Oh
 that sounds good
 because that's great 
 That must be the ones that look like they're packaged for a restaurant
 Okay 
 I've 
 Right 
 hey that sounds 
 Right 
 And it's something good to have on hand too 
 It's frozen in the first place right
 So you can 
 it is frozen isn't it
 And then you can re freeze
 Hey that sounds great
 That s- 
 do you 
 And that's my favorite
 And I really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it
 that's the thing I hate most about entertaining is thinking of what I'm going to serve
 I said I can make it no time 
 It's trying to think 
 and then we just built a new home 
 and I have one of these kitchens that's the center of the house
 and so no matter where they're at your company can see you cooking Which is funny
 well this is what everyone has said 
 They said it's okay for you because you keep a real neat kitchen
 And I said yes 
 I decided it looks better in BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS than it does in practicality
 But what I have learned in the ten months we've lived here is that when I entertain I have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven with everything through ready to serve Because with the open area you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess like you said
 So you have to have the picturesque kitchen you know right out of the magazine
 You're right
 And you know the funny thing is now that I have a large kitchen with a big island and that I still have people trying to come you know 
 they'll come in the kitchen 
 and I said out 
 we have the chairs on the other side of the counter for guests 
 You're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen 
 And it has worked out 
 But at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining well enough that they know you know it's very much at home type situation
 Well we even have a better one 
 Now we decided that we all meet we have it worked
