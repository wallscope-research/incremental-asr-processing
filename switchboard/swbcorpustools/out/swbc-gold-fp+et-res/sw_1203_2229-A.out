 are you on a regular exercise program right now
 well I'm kind of off and on
 Right now I'm kind of off
 Okay 
 what type of exercise do you do
 Okay 
 I guess you don't enjoy that very much
 Do you find that to be boring
 Yeah
 Well I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring
 But I 
 Yeah 
 I haven't decided whether I want to play yet or not 
 I just bought myself a solo flex machine 
 I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V
 It's one of those universal type exercise machines 
 But I haven't really sat down and used it match yet 
 so it's collecting dust right now
 I used to jog somewhat
 Uh-huh 
 well that's good 
 Yeah 
 my parents have a treadmill 
 it's 
 when I go visit them I get on that thing every now and then
 Uh-huh 
 I just got the bicycle out today 
 and it was real nice outside 
 had to get out to do something
 I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold 
 so thought I better get outside and do something and not waist the day
 But yeah 
 I need to start something again 
 I've always of that to be really one of the best forms of exercise 
 but it's terribly boring 
 and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently
 No 
 I never have 
 Well I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries 
 I usually only go about a mile or two
 Yeah
 it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt 
 Suppose to be much better if you find grass or dirt to jog on
 You have to have the right type of shoes too 
 that's very important
 But 
 Yeah 
 I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often 
 my don't get very much use 
 Uh-huh 
 I usually enjoy the exercise I do 
 but like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a program 
 So I'll bicycle 
 I get into that for a little while and maybe go out on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile 
 but then I'll get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week
 But that gets old too in a very short order
 I'm hoping that this solo flex will change things a little bit 
 I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis
 Yeah
 Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can start some type of regular program
 I've always found that when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep something going
 when I was in high school we had a choice of taking physical education courses on exercise 
 an one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine lifting weights and working out like that 
 And that was very helpful 
 we kept charts of our progress and consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks 
 I found that to be very helpful
 I need to
 I haven't started yet 
 but it's a thought
 Sounds like something I should do
 How often do you go out each week on your walking
 Okay 
 about how far do you go walking
 Okay
 Well that's good 
 Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging
 It 
 Sure
 Well if you keep up with a consistent pace just to keep the heart rating going 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is
 do you go to an aerobics class 
 or do you watch on T V
 Okay
 Which shows do you watch on T V
 okay 
 okay 
 like a Cathy Smith workout
 or Jane Fonda
 Okay 
 Right 
 every now and then I'll watch E S P N 
 I get cable on T V
 and they have a couple of shows called basic training 
 and what is the other one called
 Uh-huh
 BODIES IN MOTION that's the name of the one I was thinking of With Gill
 Yeah 
 he's not bad 
 his assistants usually aren't either
 They're always in Hawaii some place on the beach
 Yeah 
 well they do low I pact stuff now 
 *[[why utt this is notes about transcription]] they're on every day
 Yeah 
 every morning
 It's on E S P N 
 at what time 
 I can't remember what time 
 It's you know 
 I can't remember offhand what time
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 every now and then
 Uh-huh 
 well I found that they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V
 They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day Monday through Friday incase you're interested in that 
 *[[again why utt]] I actually taped a few session that they had on there 
 but I haven't done so much as watch the tape that I made
 So I'm kind of bad about that myself
 Okay 
 well I sure enjoyed to you about exercise and fitness
 So all right
 Good night
 Bye
