 Bye <> <> 
 So our discussion's about the care of the elderly
 well my dad's almost ninety 
 and he lives by himself 
 and he's in good shape
 but some friends of mine have gone through this 
 I think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and where they did some things to try to keep them mentally alive And where there were caring and compassionate people operating it 
 Do you have any experience with this yourself
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 From the lack of stimulation you mean 
 Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with that the people who operate it seem to have what you'd perceive of as genuine concern
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 it's possible 
 I was thinking also that there could be a fair burn out factor in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 So it gives them a sense of identity
 Yeah 
 I think part of what you're saying matches what I have read 
 I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who were adequately deficient in their abilities physical or mental that they couldn't take care of themselves 
 But I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide a lot of social activities
 one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities 
 and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation 
 and 
 Well I think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there 
 and I feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like put her in there
 And there's so much
