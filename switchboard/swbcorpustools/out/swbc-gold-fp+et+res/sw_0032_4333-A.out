 Steve with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them 
 or or or what do you think 
 Uh-huh 
 See I never thought really it's I never really thought that that the the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little 
 I I always that the the real question was is are we getting a reasonable return on on investment 
 For instance like Social Security tax or Soc- 
 I mean that's that's tax 
 we're paying money 
 and and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us 
 So that's 
 yeah you know 
 when I when I see that money taken out of my paycheck each each week I or each every other week I I really think that money's history 
 and you know so as far as return investment that's not that's nothing 
 and we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back 
 someone was telling me that there is a there's still an office in you know staffed with with people there and in D C that are researching to find a cure for polio which 
 I may be wrong 
 but I believe that the cure for polio is already founded 
 but but supposedly once you have an office in D C or you know and and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down 
 and and they just haven't yet
 Uh-huh
 Well that might be the difference 
 I don't know 
 the other thing that I remember seeing on T V lately is had to do with 
 it's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically
 that that histor- for some reason historical sites with you know the the full federal money and everything seem to appear as as almost as like political favors to to very strong politicians
 Uh-huh
 So it sounds like you you think that that we'd be able to save some money by passing the line item veto
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Pork barrel politics
 Yeah 
 but Massachusetts wasn't when Dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially
 Uh-huh 
 I mean I don't know 
 I 
 It's I mean it's it's tough 
 I mean there's there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations 
 I guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot 
 or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and and whatnot
