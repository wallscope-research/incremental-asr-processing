 Well seems to me the one of the reasons that people don't go out to vote is maybe they're bored with the whole election process
 Well sometimes strangely enough one vote has made the difference
 Well it's kind of strange 
 because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day-to-day lives
 Well maybe part of the problem is they don't they think they have enough choices
 You know in some of the European countries they have numbers of parties that run 
 and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country
 Well maybe it's a matter of you know voter awareness 
 Well I think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long 
 In Britain you know they have a set period of time 
 and and for campaign that's it 
 In this country it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign
 Well the they don't want to spend the time 
 or they don't have the money
 Well it's a matter of name recognition 
 People aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of
 And even debates don't seem to help much 
 So we're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers
 Well that was certainly a media event 
 Well he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease
