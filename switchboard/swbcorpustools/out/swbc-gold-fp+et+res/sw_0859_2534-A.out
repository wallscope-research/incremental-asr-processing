 So what kind of neat hobbies do you have
 I like gardening 
 I wish I had a green thumb though
 I've got a brown thumb 
 That's what everything turns
 I keep trying you know 
 you just can't can't give up on it 
 [ I + I bought some plants from Michigan Bulb Company 
 they send them to you all ready alive
 really
 I guess I guess these are going to croak too
 Since I've got cats I decided to get some catnip
 Lots and lots of catnip 
 so it's it's still green 
 and it's been two days 
 so I'm encouraged 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 there's a 
 I don't know 
 do you have Lowe's up there
 Its 
 building contra- 
 or building supplies place
 they they also have a garden shop 
 and they they offer just as good a guarantee if you buy it from them
 Yeah
 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 something like that 
 I got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff 
 so I'm going to wait on those
 probably Spring 
 but I don't much care about things like that 
 I'll I'll make a little sort of greenhouse a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in
 Something something to keep me occupied you see
 I'll buy some plastic and make a little house 
 and 
 yeah 
 and watch the cats tear it up
 They they just like to get in and dig
 they love to dig 
 I had I had some 
 I don't know what kind they are 
 I've already forgotten 
 just regular old flower seeds 
 and I planted them 
 and I was so I was so thrilled because they came up I mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place 
 And then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that
 So I have to hang these things high 
 so they can't get to them 
 Especially the catnip
 Three
 yeah 
 yeah 
 because they they like to get in and fertilize things too 
 But why would it be illegal
 yeah 
 right
 Well if nobody yeah if nobody complains you're all right
 
 yeah 
 an 
 and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway
 You know you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property
 Yeah 
 right here Bambi 
 gosh
 Well let's see 
 other than gardening which I fiddle at 
 I'm not very good at 
 what else do I mostly just computer stuff
 I just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that 
 cooking that's not really a hobby 
 it's a necessity
 But but I enjoy it 
 I like to think that I'm a very good cook
 hobbies 
 that's about it 
 I don't have much time for hobbies between being a student and trying to run a business on the side 
 you don't have a lot of time
 Yeah 
 and raising cats
 Well it's it started out as a hobby actually
 it just it developed into sort of a business you know 
 we breed them and all that 
 but we didn't you know we didn't really start it for the money 
 it was just 
 they were fun to have around 
 and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds an 
 And now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them and you know all this kind of stuff
 I've got a a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian
 Yeah 
 the Himie is probably the sweetest one 
 She's she's just a little sweetheart
 We 
 the the Bombay had a litter last October 
 and w- 
 I just got her back from the vet this morning getting her spayed 
 Only going to breed them once
 And she's not she's not feeling too great today
 No 
 m- most breeders are in it for the money 
 so they'll bree- they'll breed them twice a year 
 and I I just think that it's kind of I don't know it's kind of cruel 
 You know they just they just breed these they breed them before they're ready 
 and you're never you're never rea- 
 and and they they do a lot of inbreeding too 
 and so you end up with you know kind of strange kittens
 And I just don't like that
 We're we sold all that litter
 we 
 there's not that much call to for Bombays
 they're they're registered 
 but they're not they're not they're not show cats
 so all you can do is sell them as pet quality
 so what you've got is a registered pet 
 And not too many people want Bombays 
 They want things like Himie Persians and Turkish Vans
 Turkish Vans if you've never seen one I mean you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred 
 It's just medium size short hair cat 
 It's got 
 he's mostly white with brown and black patches
 But they have nice personalities 
 and they're very inquisitive 
 now the Himie we'll probably breed her a couple of times 
 and we'll we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those
 It's just the stud fees are so much though 
 It'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her 
 We we want to breed her with a champion 
 so 
 Yeah 
 the Persian is
 and the other two are short hairs
 Yeah 
 she's she's sweet 
 Going to have some nice kittens I hope
 She's she's 
 if yo- if you know what a Himalayan is generally they look something like 
 well they come in a lot of different colors 
 People don't realize it 
 but they're sort of like Siamese in a way 
 They have the they have the gloves on the paws 
 and they're they're usually two colored 
 but this one is is 
 she's pre- predominantly black 
 but she has chocolate paws chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters
 And yeah 
 she's she's quite attractive looking
 Hope hope the stud will find her attractive
 And and that she has a whole bunch of kittens 
 But we have to be careful 
 you know we have to get a particular color point stud 
 You can't just breed them with anything 
 We have to get a we have to get a silver point Himie 
 so that the silver will be predominate in the kittens
 That's it that's the fun part trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with 
 can't just go out there and say okay you guys breed you know 
 That's right
 Well actually I mean it it is a business in a way 
 but it it's a lot of fun as a hobby Especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats 
 We're we're about to get another breed 
 we're go- we're going to buy a Devon Rex 
 And I didn't I don't like Devon Rexes at first
 It's a well actually it's a mutant 
 It it comes from England and fr- in the county of Devon
 And it's a mutant cat 
 And they're they're pretty expensive 
 we're going to we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one 
 they're very thin 
 they're they're they're long and lanky and skinny
 And they have real short hair 
 It's curly as a matter of fact
 yeah 
 it it it's a strange looking cat 
 I didn't like them at first 
 They've got great big ears
