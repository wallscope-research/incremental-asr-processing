 well what would you say your opinion is on gun control
 Ye- 
 Well I think down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns
 And I think they need that 
 and I do have a I have a pistol 
 It's a little twenty-two 
 and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun
 An- you know I do like to have my guns
 I don't know if I'll ever use it you know 
 And like you my bullets to my little pistol's probably about three years old 
 my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two
 But I like to have them where handy
 I've never heard of anything like that
 That would be nice 
 But a- you know 
 the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other
 Yeah 
 I know 
 I I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in Tennessee And they had a waiting period 
 and we bought it there 
 And 
 About nine days
 No 
 No 
 Th- 
 somebody wants to do that 
 I I at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms
 A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does
 No 
 a shotgun's got too much of a spread 
 Or at least ours does 
 it's you know 
 you have a little thing on the bo- bottom of th- on top of the barrel where you you turn it 
 you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get
 And the spread changes
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 My husband had a a police gun at one time 
 And I shot that thing one time 
 Almost knocked me down
 And it just a li- 
 I don- I forget 
 I think it was a three fifty-seven 
 I'm not sure
 He belonged to one awhile back 
 since we moved 
 we've only been here in Texas for about a year 
 and we can't even find a place to shoot Just for target practice 
 I'd love to get used to that shotgun 
 We traded his pistol for that shotgun
 Yeah 
 Well that's what my husband 
 when he was in that gun club where he was doing that <> 
 It you know 
 he went mostly just to shoot at paper targets
 but you know they used speed and accuracy and all that
 That's a good 
 I've never thought of that
 That's a good point
 Yeah 
 That's 
 and <> yeah
 It 
 well we we was living on a navy base down in Memphis 
 and this one guy decided to play lonesome cowboy or something 
 And he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot
 Well he went tumbling down the steps along with shooting his foot almost off 
 He broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things I'm sure being Mister Cowboy 
 I can't remember what the na- the term was going around 
 It was about four or five years ago
 But Now I guess that would be a good idea 
 that's a hard one because we did that 
 But I think there ought to be some rule against it 
 I'll you know 
 the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something the cops are going to come to you
 
 I have no idea 
 I've only had one gun 
 and I've kept it you know the one gun that was in my name
 Yeah 
 I- 
 I don't think you have to register a shotgun 
 Well see my husband has a thing 
 If they go to regulating all right banning guns Pri- pri- pri- private cit- citizens 
 this 
 my kid is jumping on me 
 I can't hardly talk
 My husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 And everything about you
 I 
 bu- bu- you know they know so how much money you make a week to probably your 
 my kid is banging 
 I was seeing what they was banging on 
 I've lost my train of thought 
 I'm sorry 
 the Soc- 
 Yeah 
 They they probably know everything from half the time wh- ho- what time you go to the bathroom
 No 
 that's that's a little bit extreme 
 But they could know anything and everything about you 
 And I'd like to have my gun 
 If they go to banding banning them I'd lose my gun 
 but we wouldn't lose our pis- our shotgun 
 And we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about
 But I don't I don't 
 No
 Yeah 
 W- 
 Yeah 
 Well you can look in the the 
 we got a thing down here called A SHOPPER
 It's a a ho- it's a it's a bargain thing 
 you go and ever- you know always see guns in there Five to seven guns a day 
 It comes out every Tuesday
 No 
 None whatsoever 
 You call 
 we sold a refrigerator through it 
 and it took us all of twelve hours 
 Yeah
 You know And I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun
 Yeah 
 Well I agree with you there 
 They do have too much control over us already
 we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have
 Yeah 
 I guess so 
 I don't know 
 They're
