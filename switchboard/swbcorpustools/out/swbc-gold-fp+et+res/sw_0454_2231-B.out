 In the way that it's applied or it's applied at all 
 So I 
 how do you feel that it should be applied
 And that that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced
 Yeah
 That's 
 I agree with that completely 
 I know we don't have enough prisons 
 but there has got to be some kind of punishment For these people
 Because if they turn around they can get away they get away with it 
 and they get away with it 
 and they get away with it 
 and then they do something worse
 and they get a slap on the wrist 
 They get thirty days in jail
 and they final get up to where they kill somebody else 
 and they go through fourteen appeals and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars
 And it's 
 Well they certainly are living off our ex- at our expense 
 I didn't 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 And and be paroled and and have served the sentence 
 that's what that's what people face with that choice 
 One thing I really hate is they don't explain to the jurors in a in a trial in a capital murder trial or in cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to you know 
 they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's you know that it's going to you know 
 that should be life 
 but instead in in 
 given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something and then turn around in thirty years that you know 
 and less they're out 
 Even if if they're even in that long 
 Or they appeal 
 and then they get an appeal that says it was you know an unjust amount of time an extraordinary long length or something
 Yeah
 I'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent 
 I think people know that nobody that it doesn't you know 
 i- it's not a deterrent right now because it's not really effective
 There's should be you know this for this crime this is the penalty 
 You killed someone you know in cold blood or whatever 
 This is what's going to happen
 And I mean it sounds horrible 
 It 
 I hear myself saying this 
 and but I don't know what else to do with some of these people that are 
 because they let them back out again 
 and they do the same thing over and over again 
 then they put them back in jail 
 and they get out 
 and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed
 and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system 
 And it's like I said at our expense
 Yes
 I know 
 I you read about it in the paper every day somebody who's done this or that something really horrible
 and they just get away with it 
 and nothing happens
 Yeah
 I think I think Texas is wha- Texas the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty 
 and I think I know California had it for a long time 
 and then they took it off the books 
 they repealed it
 and people like Charles Manson and and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison and are now now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty for whatever various crimes 
 The people who were there originally when they when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are still in there for are in prison in quote for life and and are now coming up for parole 
 some of them like Manson who's come up you know 
 it's been denied fortunately 
 but 
 Yeah
 Well the jury that sentenced him sentenced him to death
 and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal the state of California revoked the law in the early seventies 
 and then they reinstated it later 
 but the penalty didn't go back You know
 It seems like a lot of times the law is is totally on the criminal side and and isn't protecting the rest of the people
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 And the the laws are all the rules 
 Some of the things that would make sense to to tell the jury that this this guy has a a prior cri- criminal history you know where he's raped ten women 
 and then he gets up for this one trial 
 and they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again
 and so they say well this is you know 
 I I don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever 
 but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal
 Yeah
 yeah Well
 To some extent if they would do something with some of those people 
 But that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too
 They plead insanity
 and then three years later they're cured and let loose on society again
 I mean it's a it's a scary world out there anymore where your afraid to go out 
 I know in in the Dallas metroplex area I don't go out hardly if I don't have to at night by myself
 and I I certainly I I grew up in a smaller town in Texas 
 and it wasn't that way when I was younger
 We could go around 
 and boy and 
 Yes 
 Ever 
 you can't even 
 when I was a kid I would run between my neighbors three and four blocks sometimes and as long as my mom had a general idea where I was and I was back on the time 
 and now I don't let my kids out of the front yard that I can't see them 
 Uh-huh
 Well good talking to you too 
 Bye
 bye
