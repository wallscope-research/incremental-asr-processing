 So how do you feel about our policy in Latin America 
 Yeah 
 Well do you think that's do you think that's right 
 Do you think we should direct the government 
 Yeah <>
 Yeah
 Well I have a friend that's de- 
 his descendants are from Nicaragua and very 
 I mean it's like his mother his mother came over 
 and he you know 
 I just get sorry feelings for people that their family came from there and how they feel about you know our intervention and their government and stuff like that
 and he he was all for it because it's just like you say 
 there's so many people there that that get the kind of control that's bad you know
 and that their governments can become so corrupt 
 and it's like well you know I use to feel like 
 well they they should work their way you know 
 they should should be able to work their self out of it 
 or you know why why why intervene in another country's you know problems and things like that 
 Why why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that 
 but I think just a lot of times if we don't then then it then that influence will affect our country too for one 
 And for two you know that it does help 
 I mean you know I think the people in those country do want our help The people that are under conditions that are you know not favorable to this their rights
 So
 Yeah
 But I wish we didn't have to 
 I mean I'd rather 
 even if a country chooses a government that's not you know exactly the kind of government that we have you know or or as in complete opposition to it at least it's their choice as long as long it's one that's <> that that makes since so to speak you know 
 it is a government that stays in power that can stay in power 
 but it seems like most of them don't you know
 yeah
 So you think like C I A influence and our money over there 
 Yeah
 Or or government aids and stuff
 Well then how can you how can you say as far as like in Europe as far as the the toppling of those kinds of governments you know like 
 I mean 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 But we don't we're not intervening in that 
 or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing <> 
 Are 
 And 
 Yeah
 See I I agree with that
 Yeah
 I I agree that that the communication that now that communication has become so much more widespread and you know worldwide that people are realizing hey we don't have it so good and let's stand up
 you know this is ridiculous 
 we're living with these kind of conditions in a world that's advancing as fast as it is
 that 
 I think people are just saying no way we don't want anywhere of this
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well I mean I don't mean to 
 well I guess I do in a way 
 sometimes I think a religion has a lot to do with that 
 I think that that because of those co- countries a lot you know where such Catholic influence 
 And I think the Catholic religion itself was was such a dominant factor as far as keeping the people down so to speak
 but 
 
 But but see but I don't agree with that because the Catholic religion as far as through the ages has been the rule so to speak 
 You know they are the ones that set that set a lot of the rules 
 and they are the ones that do keep the people down
 I mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're yet they're expected to bow down to it I think that keeps people in sort of line you know
 Well when when it use to be Latin 
 I'm just saying that the old church 
 Yeah 
 Which it's not that way now 
 but I think that there is just that I think that it's just Latin countries are slower in coming around
 Well Latin
 they still didn't understand it though I don't think
 because I I descend from that 
 And I you know I don't can't I don't understand Latin
 and I'm of Spanish descent 
 So I I just think that has something to do with why Latinos or tend to be you know the mee- the more meek you know 
 they tend to be more <> 
 like not stand up for their rights as much 
 They're not really sure of what they are I don't think
 Well I mean how can you contrast the Europeans and their vocalism on their rights to to say the people in Latin America 
 I mean why are they why are they not as vocal 
 or why do they not you know stand up so to speak for their rights
 Uh-huh
 I don't agree with that 
 I don't agree 
 because I think that they are pretty vocal about it in in Africa 
 I think they've made a lot more chances 
 They they've their very vocal
 So what's the difference
 Yeah
 So what makes the difference between say South America and the rest I mean South Africa and it is rest of Africa *[[slash error]] Yeah
 *[[b]] Yeah
 I think it maybe has to do with a lo- a lot to do with education 
 because you look at the European countries 
 I think they tend to be more educated much more educated than than Africa or the Latin American countries
 Uh-huh
 Well I know that Russia they're they're comparably more better educated than we are in our country
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 In our country
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well that's just it though good education
 Is it good education 
 It may be free but is it good education 
 and that's just it 
 are we willing to pay for it you know
 I mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all 
 but so are they willing to pay for you know quality education you know
 So you know and yet they yet people get very frightened when they see the Japanese moving in and the Russians moving in certain areas of technology you know that we use to dominate 
 and it's like well you know they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do 
 So you're going to have to expect it 
 So what you 
 are you willing to compromise a little and and pay pay some take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education 
 So I don't know
 But I I
