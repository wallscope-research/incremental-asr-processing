 Possibly in the jury selection would be the only 
 just for example what we're seeing in California I guess 
 It makes you wonder had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome 
 and th- and the problems that that has come <> that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating just makes you wonder I guess whether or not they

 That's that's bad 
 Uh-huh
 No 
 It 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yes 
 That's right
 They're only going to suffer
 T- they're only going to suffer 
 They they've defeated themselves with with their looting and violence 
 I understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or don't live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the on the tape 
 and 
 I know 
 Yeah 
 it's really ridiculous
 Against forty other people being 
 Those deaths
 Uh-huh 
 Or just a by- an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what
 
 Or or beaten

 Right 
 That's that's exactly how I feel too 
 I wouldn't have they wouldn't have stopped my car for any anything had I seen them coming 
 But I was just wondering since you're you're in you're back east and a little closer to the the bigger cities than we are in Idaho here
