 Okay 
 you ready to discuss the the topic
 Okay 
 the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in America and how they relate or how they differ today than they were ten fifteen or thirty years ago
 You ready for that
 Okay 
 Pardon me
 Okay 
 well there's 
 it's kind of an interesting topic 
 and one that I think is quite fascinating because couple of years ago I guess 
 not very not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the United States but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in you know a very comfortable position so to say even though the the cold war was was in full swing You know 
 you had the the Russians against the Americans the Communists against the Free World 
 and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically not only on the political front but also on the economic front where couple of years ago we had America was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned 
 and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period 
 We're also have a very humongous trade deficit 
 and and that's kind of frightening 
 Also you know a couple of years ago ten fif- fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life 
 and thirty years ago that was that was basically it whereas now we're expected to have a career change [ every + you know every couple of years and possibly fi- four to five career changes throughout our lifetime 
 and so I think you know things 
 there's been an awful lot of social change lately 
 and we- 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 True
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 yes
 True 
 true
 Uh-huh
 Well do do you think that's good or bad
 You think that's great
 That's some 
 yeah 
 because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position 
 they they're very comfortable 
 they lose the ability to learn 
 and they in a sense become unteachable 
 They think they know all there is to know in the area set path and you know come in and put my time in from nine to five 
 and when that's over with that's that's it without even giving a second thought to advancing their education or getting extracurricular education 
 and and I think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I agree with that 
 I agree with that 
 But I believe that an individual should really learn how to to learn
 learn how to adapt 
 learn how to grow in the in their college or whatever education they might take 
 Well that that's good 
 that's good
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I I read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now
 That stress is a very prominent factor in the work place 
 and it affects
