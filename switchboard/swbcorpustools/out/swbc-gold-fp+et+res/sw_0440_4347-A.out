 not too bad really 
 I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just I really didn't want it 
 but I got it anyway 
 and it was a Braun 
 and they were real good about taking it back 
 It wasn't a problem at all 
 so I was able to get that back pretty easily
 But I don't know 
 I really haven't returned a whole lot lately 
 Have you
 
 Right 
 Yeah
 Right 
 like 
 Exactly
 I was reading 
 Right 
 I was reading something in CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact 
 They were talking about cars the car issue just came out And about how yeah you'd like to buy an American car maybe 
 but you know the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever
 like I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger 
 and and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi
 You know so it's like what are you going to do you know
 But that's the way it is 
 I don't know 
 I I personally feel that if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them you know that's the way it goes 
 and you know people man- more than manufacturers should get a clue 
 and you know they should start making quality products
 That's what I thought too until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue
 they've got all the American well all the all the cars rated you know 
 and essentially I h- I don't see much of a trend 
 I mean just like every other time that you look at it the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there 
 There's nothing wrong with them and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars 
 But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy 
 and they're pieces of junk
 Yeah 
 that's ninety that's eighty-six through ninety-one
 But I don't know 
 may- maybe they're getting better 
 maybe they're starting to get a clue 
 Yeah 
 that's just it 
 Technology that comes in right now is is probably not going to be imple- implemented until you know quite a few years down the road 
 But 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 because technology is so you know volatile and changing all the time
 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It 
 uh th- they keep up c- with it pretty quickly 
 and that's that's a real good thing I guess
 I don't know
 Yeah
 Right 
 they're kind of the leaders right now you know 
 I used to see all those commercials for Windows you know 
 and you're like gee they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name
 Yeah you know
 Exactly 
 almost is the key word there too you know because I I really I've used both 
 and I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all
 
 Yeah yeah that's true too
 But I don't know 
 I'm really I've gotten a little bit out of the the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home 
 I I do use a Mac at work 
 but I really don't don't do much with it at home 
 but 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 you sound like you must work in the computer business
 Yeah 
 All right
 No
 Well that's that's all right
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Something that I find uncomfortable is you know you you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer 
 and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know 
 let let's take the example the modem for you know 
 Okay 
 w- w- what baud rate do you get 
 Well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba-
