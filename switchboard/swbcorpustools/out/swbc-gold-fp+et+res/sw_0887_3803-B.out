 Well sort of mixed feelings about it I guess 
 I I s- I lean more towards the control side than than towards you know just the the free free army 
 on the other hand I it's it's sort of an issue of of 
 I'm not I'm not a great fan of of government control in general 
 and so it's it's kind of a tough issue 
 What about yourself
 Uh-huh
 I'm I'm sure 
 yeah 
 so you would take a position where somebody without without a specific use 
 in other words if they just wanted to have a a gun to have in their home you wouldn't you wouldn't like them to be able to do that 
 Is that 
 Yeah 
 I I have I have the impression that that the the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not are are probably not from the people that are are buying them through legitimate channels anyway 
 that may be wrong 
 you know I mean certainly there there are cases of of you know children who find their parents' gun or something and and shoot a brother or sister or you know things like that that need to be definitely avoided 
 and that's that's certainly within the channels 
 right
 But a lot of the the crime I think that goes on I I don't know to what the degree the guns are are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I I mean I think some sta- 
 or I I don't know if it's been actually been implemented 
 I think so 
 or at least there's been talk about doing you know like waiting periods and and things like that 
 and and you know I I think stuff like that is perfectly good 
 I mean basically if you if you don't intend to do anything stra- you know if you if you're buying it for legitimate purposes waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem You know and and things 
 I don't know 
 I've you know 
 I I don't own a gun and and don't really want one
 and I'd just as soon a lot fewer people did
 but on the other hand you know like I say I kind of kind of against government control in general 
 
 Yeah 
 and I you know 
 something about banning is that you know there there are so many weapons out there that that they're not going to disappear anytime soon 
 and they're already 
 I know there's a ready market for them you know 
 in the s- 
 the stolen stolen guns can be sold 
 I mean the first thing a a a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun
 Right 
 because because they they can be so easily sold 
 and you know they're they're 
 I don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country 
 but it's not like they're going to disappear all of a sudden even if you do do a total ban on them 
 it's a real tough problem
 I I don't know 
 I don't know where I really come down on it 
 I mean I I grew up 
 my father was a hunter 
 right 
 and that's and that's sort of almost a separate issue 
 I think we've generally been talking about handguns and that kind of thing 
 right You know 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well we you know we I grew up with them 
 I never really took to hunting 
 I mean I did some of it 
 but you know we didn't have any we never had any handguns or anything like that 
 We had you know had shotguns for for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that
 And you know it was a whole different thing 
 and and gun safety was taken very seriously 
 and it was you know 
 I mean before we go hunting we we took safety courses you know 
 and and and it 
 but you know that's that seems to me to be just a whole another issue
 you know the the thing 
 the the 
 yeah 
 I'm not certain that people are are are terribly concerned about other people
