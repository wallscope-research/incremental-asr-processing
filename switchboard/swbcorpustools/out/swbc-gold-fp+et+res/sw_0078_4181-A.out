 I don't think anybody pays too little
 Do you get hit up for local taxes there
 so y- y- you get the whole smorgasbord
 Well I I actually live in New Hampshire tax free or die Uh-huh 
 No 
 actually there's no sales tax in New Hampshire either
 No 
 what there is is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything
 The only problem is I work in Massachusetts 
 so they they hit me up for the five percent there
 Yep 
 but it 
 well you know we 
 it's only a state tax here no local
 We've got a five percent sales tax
 But the problem is that so I'm paying state tax even if I don't live here
 But at least on things like stock options and things like that they don't tax me
 So that's not too bad
 I I mean I I'd consider twenty percent lucky because just on I mean you know when you figure out just on feds you know I actually hit the thirty-one bracket this year which was no fun
 Right 
 and also you know then you figure out seven or eight percent for F I C A which is taxes where you 
 most people forget about them because you've g- you know you can't always get your F I C A back at the end of the year 
 But so you know and then you know like a five percent surtax I'm paying forty percent tax
 Yeah 
 well I I mean I think there's some people there y- certainly are some things where you need infrastructure 
 and you need you n- you know 
 there are things government does better you know 
 I think government does a better space program than you're going to get out of private individuals 
 but you know I think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way 
 or You know and and just tremendous amounts of you know 
 so much of it is now just going to service debt or you know is going in into into programs that you know 
 yeah 
 they are they are a fat 
 You know I think the military is really fat 
 I think that a lot of the the H E W services although they're providing necessary services have too much fat in them
 You know like we 
 Yeah 
 I mean we we spend a fortune for things like V A hospitals 
 and you know then you look at how well they're managed you know 
 I don't think we're getting our money's work out worth out of there 
 I think it's all going into into bureaucrats
 Well be- between him and Reagan 
 yeah
 The great communicator 
 yeah 
 they think 
 yeah 
 and then they go and say I'm not c- 
 Congress they're the fault for it
 But you know the other thing is it's tricky though 
 because like in New Hampshire they say all right let's cut the military budget
 Well yeah 
 then you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire
 you lose 
 Grotten Connecticut goes 
 so you know it's like you know it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know 
 if the if the if people lose their jobs then they become a load 
 and they're not contributing taxes
 So you know it's it's very hard to say you know this is what we should cut
 Who aren't contributing 
 Right 
 yeah
 And in our 
 Right
 But what's very funny is in our town meeting they were v- 
 th- this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution d- for our local town to do it to have you have people line item their taxes
 They say I want to pay for this and this and this and this and this 
 Course the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they don't use
 Yeah
