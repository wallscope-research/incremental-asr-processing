 Okay 
 Well I'm a Vietnam era veteran 
 and I was fortunate not to have to serve in the theater 
 however my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation 
 I'm of the old school that believes that the contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored 
 However I think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker 
 but those are my personal thoughts 
 and I think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run World War Two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people 
 But as it was the politicians ran the the Korean conflict and ultimately the Vietnam thing 
 and we managed to come out losers all the way around 
 And so this is what trigger- ultimately triggered us United States per se being deciding to get out of the role of world policeman 
 Your views 
 Well
 We got into it because of SEATO agreement back just right after World War Two that we pledged a mutual defense of of the South Vietnamese 
 and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another 
 and really we 
 I I question us you know now 
 of course hindsight is all too clear
 so we're we we have to have to deal with with the situation as as we played it
 I 
 don't get me started on those people 
 You know before she before Jane Fonda did did what she did I thought she was a wonderful person 
 but after well 
 I I just don't have anything want anything to do with her any more 
 because you support you support your government
 okay 
 right or wrong 
 I don't think is is we can determine whether we were right or wrong 
 because you're you're having to deal with again 
 I think we could have made a different agreement back in for- the for- the late forties era that would have kept of there
 Can you hold just a second Terry
 One moment please
 Sorry for the delay
 yeah 
 this is 
 the the the mutual defense thing was 
 we we 
 it was complicated 
 and I don't think everybody knows the whole situation 
 I don't 
 But from what I can gather is we went and said yeah we will help the South Vietnamese should they ask 
 Well the French went in and tried their old style warfare and got soundly thrashed 
 And we didn't do a whole lot better
 Well yeah 
 that was the old French colony but see the French the French were our allies in NATO
 and they're also our allies in SEATO which was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization which has since been disbanded as far as I know 
 you know NATO is is on the way of being disbanded 
 but the you know the French yeah 
 we go in as an ally to the French and says yeah we'll we'll help you out if you get in a bind 
 Well they got in a bind and says we don't want to you know play any more
 so we we kind of we kind of got got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly organi- operations and then the full scale you know full scale troops et cetera et cetera et cetera
 yeah 
 yeah 
 roughly
