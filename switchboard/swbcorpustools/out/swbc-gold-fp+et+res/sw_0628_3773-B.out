 Homes 
 yes sir 
 uh-huh 
 What are are you settled in a place
 Right <>
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Well we left here in seventy-six 
 we were here for a few years 
 then we have come back just this summer 
 Right now we're looking for housing somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area 
 Are you familiar with that
 Yeah 
 it is 
 The kids are in school here in Duncanville 
 We're in a temporary place right now 
 and so they've enjoyed the school 
 so we're kind of trying to stay here 
 but 
 Well what the problem we got is that we've got five children
 and so we really want four or five bedroom house 
 and you know everybody says you know how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing 
 so we we look at the paper 
 we look at our talk to our realtor 
 and you can cut you know the listings in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms you know or five 
 Are you looking 
 or you settled 
 I mean 
 H- having 
 great
 That empty nest syndrome is going to set in I guess
 Great
 Okay
 Okay 
 you are you from Florida originally
 Yeah <>
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 We've got five 
 and the oldest is ninth grade 
 and the youngest is second grade 
 and I think they're going to be with us forever
 I don't know if that's true 
 but it's sure you know we're not anywhere near looking to cut down in size 
 We're we're trying to find 
 yeah 
 In fact six would be real good
 My wife and I can share a bedroom 
 Either 
 I don't think it's possible unless you you know multimillionaire something like that
 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 it is 
 yeah
 we're having 
 actually if we find something for I'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we'll be doing all right you know 
 That's 
 but I think the thing's out there 
 it's just a matter of you know looking you know finding the right place 
 Wow
 yeah 
 yeah 
 I think once we get into a place it will be just fine 
 but you know it's until then it's a little stressful you know just looking all the time and that sort of thing
 yeah
 Maybe that's the case 
 At least she's got more opinions you know 
 there's seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about You know openness the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that I would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore you know
 So What kind of business are you in
 yeah 
 great
 we're with an organization called Wycliff Bible Translators
 It's a a missions organization and doing translation linguistics that sort of thing
 it's got an office down here in in near Duncanville 
 and we just moved down to be on staff down here 
 so 
 Right
 we were really surprised to find that they're higher here 
 When we moved from Louisiana to Denver it was astounding you know to find that prices were I guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected 
 And then to come down here we thought things would be lower 
 and they're not 
 I guess really prices for housing are just
