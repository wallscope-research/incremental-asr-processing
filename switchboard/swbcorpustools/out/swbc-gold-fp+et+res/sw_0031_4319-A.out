 so what are your benefits like at your job 
 and how do you feel about them
 that's good
 Uh-huh
 What kind of a degree have you got
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 How long have you been with them
 
 That's good
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 But for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered
 So that you've got small small things to gripe about
 Wow
 Well that sounds like you must feel really good about it
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Well I work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory 
 I also have a part time job at a law firm 
 and I get no benefits from them at to the part time work although they pay better per hour than my my sort of quote real job does
 and benefits through the government are really 
 they just they're not the greatest 
 I before I I got my degree 
 I'm c- a computer scientist
 and before I got my degree I had done paralegal work for law firms here in Washington 
 and at that time I was in gravy city 
 the law firms in this town are not you know 
 for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties 
 and benefits were just amazing
 and we had everything paid for 
 and anyway with the government it's not quite that nice a deal 
 but it's you know it's it's okay 
 What we have to do is we have to pay about twenty percent of our our costs 
 and it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing 
 and the plans that are available to us range from kind of mediocre to really sweet 
 and so I I think I'm actually involved in a relatively good p- plan at this point 
 but it could be better 
 that's for sure 
 and but you know the- there are other things that you get when you work for the government i- in in terms of more relaxed atmosphere 
 It's really nice to be for me anyway to be able to work in a research atmosphere where I don't have to you know worry about academics or anything like that 
 and so I'm I'm really kind of happy about that end of of things 
 It's 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Wow 
 that's fabulous
 You see now that's that's interesting 
 because I have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area
 He he lives in Andover
 and the work that he 
 he's specifically an engineer and and does work with the Hewlett Packard machines that do sonographic imagining
 and I've been over to see his complex over there 
 and it's amazing
 It's it's all ecologically designed 
 and and he seems really really happy with the the set up
 And 
 Uh-huh
