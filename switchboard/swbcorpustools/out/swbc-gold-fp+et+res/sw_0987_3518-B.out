 Hi 
 how you doing Kevin
 Good 
 good 
 glad to hear that 
 I understand 
 Total banner
 No 
 I I believe that the American public and I as an individual and private citizen have a right to to bear arms and to have a gun as long as I am responsible with it and protect the safety and welfare of my kids 
 and and so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it 
 I think that education with a gun is is critical and important 
 however I do believe that guns ought to be maintained and and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns 
 and in the heat of the moment they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people 
 so on a scale of one to ten I I think I would rate myself as a in the six or seven or eight
 But I think that there ought to be some control 
 but I still think that individuals have a right 
 How do you feel about it
 Well I don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate 
 that that might cool down some tempers 
 I think a a one day would be sufficient 
 The reason I say that is there is an awful lot of people who go to gun shows 
 and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun if that five day waiting period were in effect you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show
 Well I don't think you can mail thing guns through the mail 
 I don't know
 I think that's a against the law ever since Kennedy was assassinated 
 So how do you feel about guns
 Uh-huh
 Well do you think that there will continue to always be crazies
 Then how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Okay 
 Do you do you feel there is a need in the world today to have a an automatic handgun
 Well I think that the the police or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves 
 but the public I don't know
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 not an Uzi 
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Yes 
 that's true
 and he saved himself in the in the in the process also
 Very fine 
 very 
 No 
 they That's that's prohibited where we work 
 Although down here in Texas you do have a right to to wear and carry arms with you at all times 
 That's still that's still you can still do that down here
 you can't 
 no 
 it should not be concealed 
 It has to be on the hip 
 Has to be in sight so that you know that you're not a menace or a problem to individuals 
 How about where you live there in Utah
