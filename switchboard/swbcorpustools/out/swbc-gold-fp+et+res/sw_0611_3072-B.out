 Okay
 Recently 
 my most recent trip was last year 
 and that was Detroit
 Yeah
 Well it wasn't really 
 It was to see an old relative
 And it was just to have some fellowship with her
 No 
 The only thing that I I visited that you know is quite a tourist spot is Cancun Mexico
 And that was real nice 
 No 
 we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there
 Yeah 
 and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit from our daily routine
 
 Uh-huh
 Yes

 well that's nice
 Yeah
 Well my my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity 
 and that's canoeing
 And they've been to the Guadalupe River 
 and they also have been to I guess Colorado 
 and they've really enjoyed it
 It's a whole new 
 Uh-huh
 
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 that's neat
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Well you learn a lot of skills too 
 and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older to learn new skills
 and I think they really it really pen- penetrates in your memory you know what to do because you really have a great interest in it Because it's something you weren't forced to do 
 so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning
 And you're more receptive
 Uh-huh
 that's exciting
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I had a friend that visited England not well I think it's been probably two years now 
 but that's her next goal {A and she can do it } is go back to England 
 because she really has a great desire to do that 
 because the love that she has for it now after visiting it 
 Uh-huh

 Well I lived across the street almost from Canada 
 So that was that that's a nice place 
 Canada is very nice

 What did you wind up with

 I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement so when we do have the free time we'll have the the means to pursue our dreams
 Yeah 
 I guess that's what retirement is all about
 Yes
