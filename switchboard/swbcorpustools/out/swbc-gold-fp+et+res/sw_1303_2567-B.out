 I don't think we have one 
 Yeah 
 I was going to say it's kind of hard to have have an opinion 
 We seem to uh 
 whoever screams the loudest or whoever we happen to give the most money to at that particular time we seem to support without regard whether it's a democracy or a anarchy or anything else 
 Well uh 
 yeah 
 And then of course there was there was the uh in Columbia with the drug lords
 But we just talked a lot 
 We didn't actually do anything 
 I'm actually surprised at anything in Central America along with Panama 
 I'm just kind of surprised we did that 
 But uh 
 Especially after our friend Jimmy Carter gave it away anyway 
 But I guess they had to finally do something 
 Actually Bush has been better at that than I thought
 He has a little more d- a little more of a stand on policy than I thought he would 
 I always considered him kind of a wimp 
 Yeah 
 Reagan is kind of m- mushmouth 
 But but I guess most of the policy that we're using now is uh a combination of Reagan and Carter much as you know policy makers 
 Uh yeah 
 We have so far 
 but w- we r- really haven't 
 Of course we really haven't taken on the drug lords yet 
 I'd be interested to see if we do that 
 Well we did in Panama 
 We did in Saudi Arabia 
 It could be an interesting interesting problem
 I don't know if they could do it or not 
 Did you read Tom Clancy's A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER
 I think you need to pick that up and read it 
 It's quite uh it's it's quite interesting 
 It addresses the problem 
 Uh-huh 
 Actually he he wrote that prior to the uh Med- Medellin Cartel being exposed 
 It was on the stands prior to that time 
 It it's quite timely 
 And either he knows somebody 
 or he has a real good a real good imagination 
 because its it hits pretty close to home
 But I don't think we're going to have much of a choice in e- either Central or South America
 Um yeah 
 I think we realize it's failed 
 We just don't we just don't 
 nobody wants to make the nobody wants to make the unpopular decision of going in and invading
 We still there's still t- there's still too many Kennedys and Misinvolves and Udalls all up there
 There's too many liberals in control 
 They can't agree on anything 
 And they have blinders on as far as the policy goes 
 As long as somebody's getting killed as long as nobody knows about it it's okay 
 But but the minute it hit hits the paper then of course the Kennedys and the Misinvolves and the Udalls and the and uh the Dawes from Georgia all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is
 Of course these are the same people that also drown blonde the Chappaquiddic and stuff like that you know
 But I guess it automa- 
 I guess it's automatic respective 
 Yeah 
 You know the people have a right to know except about what it about what concerns them 
 And these are the people that make the foreign policy 
 and it it's probably basically uh 
 I would not be surprised if the Kennedy Foundation or some of those don't have a lot of uh financial holdings in in Central and South America 
 Considering the Kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway
 Every time you drink Scotch you're paying Kennedys
 Good 
 Don't ever drink Scotch 
 it's terrible 
 I quit drinking Scotch when I found out about that 
 but anyway 
 But uh as far as as far as you know Central and South America we our policy pretty much uh it depends on who we're what government we're buying down there at the particular time
 We 
 Yeah 
 Although we do need to do something about you know 
 of course in Nicaragua and around there with the Sandinistas and the Contras that's been going on for years 
 But then hell it's probably still be going on long after we're dead 
 It'll still be the same thing
 Those people down there don't really 
 I mean 
 Well I think basically they can't figure out what they want down there 
 If you give everybody what they wanted there is a complete democracy those people wouldn't know how to react because they have no education 
 It's all tradition 
 It's all traditional 
 They have to 
 you have the ruling class 
 and you have everybody else 
 It was very pleasant
 All righty 
 Good talking to you 
 Tom Clancy 
 It's called A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER 
 Uh-huh 
 He wri- he's the one who wrote uh RED OCTOBER A HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER 
 And I think i- if you read that I think you'll get a real kick out of it
 All righty 
 Bye
