 Uh-huh
 It's a two bedroom two baths duplex
 Brick and 
 No 
 we own it 
 yeah 
 well our side 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 No 
 [ huh-uh 
 Do you
 Ours is too
 We outgrew it when we moved in
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 Yeah
 wow
 You all are cramped 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 how many bedrooms is it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 How fun
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And how old's the youngest
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's what we'd like to do
 it's a wonderful place to live 
 and they 
 I don't have any kids 
 so I don't really know 
 but they say that we have wonderful schools
 Uh-huh
 
 I don't think so 
 no
 of course those are my kids
 I have two dogs
 Yeah 
 they're inside dogs
 They're my babies
 kind of a mauve and gray
 Uh-huh 
 and then the kitchen's kind of a a country pink and country blue 
 and it's all done in cows 
 I'm a cow nut 
 Uh-huh
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 sounds pretty
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Good
 That's an important factor there 
 Well you know now we have that new mall in Lewisville
 and that's just like a mile or two from our house
 but when we first moved to Coppell it's what six years ago we didn't even have a grocery store
 and now we have four 
 and Coppell's not really big enough to support fo- four grocery stores
 so 
 much very much 
 In fact it's about the size now 
 I moved down here from Chicago what twenty-three years ago and to Lewisville
 and Coppell's now about the size that Lewisville was when when I moved down here
 Uh-huh
 really
