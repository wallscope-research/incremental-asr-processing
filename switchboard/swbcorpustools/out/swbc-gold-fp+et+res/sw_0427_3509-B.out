 Well I I'm not really certain how I I'm not certain that that it does a lot of good I mean that it ends up ends up effectively avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment penalties 
 Yet on the other hand I don't know 
 I mean there is things that 
 seems like it's it's it's the right thing to do 
 Now you know I mean somebody a s- s- serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns you know fifty fifty children in a school yard 
 you kind of 
 I don't know 
 What about yourself
 Uh-huh
 I mean people like 
 I 
 it's been 
 I mean like the Arab societies and stuff end up having e- effective effective punishments 
 and and they're extremely severe 
 I you know I think to a certain degree the reason that it it doesn't serve as a deterrent may be because y- you never know if it's going to be a- applied Right 
 un- unlike like in in Arab societies If you get get caught stealing they chop off your hand 
 and and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand 
 and everybody knows exactly what what for
 and you know and here with our court system and and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can you can kind of always count on the fact 
 or or there is a good chance you're going to get off
 Uh-huh Yeah 
 some people 
 Yeah
 Except that I mean the the average cost to si- to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is is extremely high I mean something I I was amazed at per year 
 it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year To keep people in jail 
 you know and it's sort of a sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment 
 but on the other hand you know I don't I don't know if it's that is that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail 
 Uh-huh <>
 I know 
 I mean you can't 
 it doesn't Taking taking one more life doesn't doesn't doesn't re- get things back the way they were right 
 Yeah 
 I don't know I I don't I really don't know 
 I'm in Texas
 W- w- 
 No 
 I'm in Austin
 Where where are you calling from
 I see 
 uh-huh
 It's Texas is has is one of the one of the s- well 
 I guess there is more and more states that are that are going back to capital punishment 
 Texas has had it for a while 
 It's one of the quickest 
 it it 
 once it was it was reallowed 
 I think it was outlawed for a while but by the supreme court I mean or the interpretation of the constitution 
 and it seems like everybody stopped 
 and then and then once they sort of reallowed it Texas was one of the first to to actually implement it again
 They do it by by do it by lethal injection
 I'm originally from Kansas 
 and in Kansas also they they almost immediately put back capital punishment 
 and there they do it by hanging
 Still they have 
 I still remember the the the movie IN COLD BLOOD 
 I don't know if you've ever 
 I'm sure you're familiar with it 
 but have you seen the movie
 Yeah 
 That way
 Yeah 
 well they they show it 
 not not 
 I mean the the movie was made in like nineteen sixty-two or something like that
 and so it's it's not particularly graphic 
 but on the other hand it's it's fairly impressive to watch them you know walk into the room with gallows 
 It's kind of a barn like structure
 Is that right 
 Are you there in school
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 has has a 
 yeah 
 Has a real bullets 
 and the rest of them have blanks
 Yeah 
 I I certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner 
 I know that 
 I've always said that if I if I had to kill and clean and do my own my own meat I think I'd become a vegetarian
 As long as you're sort of safely removed from it it seems seems not so so bad I guess
