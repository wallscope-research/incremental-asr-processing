 Well my family moved to Texas about eight years ago 
 My husband was raised here by 
 I I have never lived here 
 so when we came back to Texas I was really kind of excited 
 There wasn't a state income tax 
 and there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at the the grocery store and things
 And all of that was new to me 
 because I'm sort of feeling like we're getting a better deal here than what I was accustomed to
 Well I lived in Missouri and then in Utah 
 and them both places had pretty good state income tax 
 And we've always paid tax you know on everything we purchased even food at the grocery store 
 So I thought it was really you know kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries 
 and but I think I mean I don't enjoy paying taxes 
 And it's hard 
 but I think that is what we have to have you know have our streets and have have our government and Excuse me And have and have the services that we need 
 and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and and things like that 
 and I think I guess what I feel is that most people they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like there's some people that aren't paying their fair share
 And that makes you feel bad
 Right 
 And you know when when last year the elections were going on the governors election and state and you know 
 I I didn't have anything against Clayton Williams personally or anything 
 but it was kind of hard for me to think here's someone as wealthy as he is 
 didn't have to pay any income tax 
 That he said that year 
 he claimed he had he didn't have to pay income tax 
 and he thought you know 
 there's some people are living pretty pretty good life styles 
 but they're not paying income tax 
 And that's not fair to me 
 And there's you know some people you know who are abusing the systems that we pay taxes to support 
 and all that makes us feel bad 
 But I think all in all how I feel is that I'm willing to pay the taxes because I think I like our country compared to the other countries I've studied and visited 
 And I'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services that I enjoy 
 How do you feel
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 no
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Right
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 Yes
 Well it is 
 and sometimes I think well for myself that income that we have we pay a certain salary 
 but I think the employer keeps in mind this will be deducted you know 
 so so many taxes will be deducted from it 
 and so I think you know our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it
 And so I think you know in that way we're compensated just by our society 
 yet you know they don't pay you what just what it would take 
 and if you pay taxes on it you wouldn't have any money left over 
 And and but some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything I wish that they would I guess because I'm not one of them I wish that they would you know realize that they they couldn't make this kind of money 
 they couldn't live that kind of life style anywhere else
 In that 
 even if they made that kind of money there's some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have socialized medicines and things that 
 they they wouldn't be able to enjoy the in that 
 So that you know they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it 
 Yes 
 they've earned it 
 And yes 
 they have such great fortune here 
 but they need to pay for it too because they couldn't do it somewhere else
 I like Texas not having the state income tax 
 and I hope that 
 because we've had enough industry here that I guess it 
 is that why we don't have 
 industry here is able to to fund the state because we have oil here and things 
 I mean that's what I've always heard 
 Is that 
 Big boom
 Yeah 
 There's something about the industry in the state That 
 there's enough 
 I know we moved here from Houston 
 and the city had enough money 
 It was really nice that they had that 
 they began to cut back because of the oil problems 
 but they would have so many community outdoor theaters and And like community country club type things 
 That the 
 it was such nice services to offer the residents in the city 
 and I really liked that
 Huh-uh
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 And I you know like 
 the property tax that we pay is so much higher than my parents pay in Missouri 
 But I'm I'm comfortable at least in this year with with 
 we have some good schools 
 The school thing might be changing 
 but I'm willing to pay for that for my children 
 And I'm willing to sacrifice I guess 
 I'm not going to be the type of person that's going to grumble about the taxes even though we're paying a pretty high percentage 
 I feel like you get what you pay for 
 and I want to be here 
 and I enjoy I enjoy living here in this country 
 and having seen other countries I'd much rather live here and pay taxes than live somewhere else and not 
 Anyway well I guess I better let you go
 Yeah 
 it was nice
 No 
 No 
 They just define it to you 
 and so you get what get luck of the draw 
 but 
 Yeah 
 anyway well good luck to you
 Bye
