 Well Carol since today's subject is our homes 
 why don't you tell me about yours
 Well I I certainly hope so 
 We have a a classic ranch up in Denton 
 Ranch style home I shou- I would hate to think that anybody thought the lot we live on as a ranch 
 it's in a subdivision and one story 
 It started out life as a three bedroom house and now has no two car garage and has the two extra rooms enclosed 
 I suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms 
 but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office out of enclosing the garage
 Almost a hundred percent
 I I can't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision 
 Ours is probably the closest to it 
 You know how realtors are 
 they'll say this could be five bedrooms 
 Yeah 
 if you had two people that don't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house
 don't need a closet 
 cathedral ceilings
 Well I hadn't thought about it in that sense of the high roofs 
 We have cathedral ceilings in two rooms In the family room and in the master bedroom 
 and those are are pleasant
 Yeah
 Right
 If it's the kind of river I'm thinking of better them than than us you know 
 Are you talking about a a real river creek
 Well that's nice 
 I came from Mississippi recently 
 and the rivers that we had there were the ones that came with the rains 
 and they didn't pay any any attention to banks and that kind of stuff
 So you're just as likely to fl- wake up and discover you're in two inches of water
 it's a third of an acre 
 I don't think that's a lot 
 in fact I have been real disappointed in the six years that I've lived out here about lot sizes 
 I'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have
 That's true
 An and while while there are some advantages to that there's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things 
 I just feel hemmed in by that 
 It's not as comfortable a living for me
 Entirely
 Fro- from that aspect you're right 
 And and it doesn't take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff
 No 
 the one 
 that's sort of what drove me to Denton when I first came out here in eighty-five 
 I started looking 
 and it seemed like the further I got away from Dallas center the more lot came with the house and and the lower the price at the same time 
 And it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city
 S- so moving up thirty-five I stopped when I got to Denton 
 You all both you all both work downtown
 well this is a wonderful thing that that you're doing here still helping them out
 but you were working downtown
 Oh
