 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah

 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 well I like like you said real life 
 I like biographies of people's lives like especially like athletes 
 for some reason it seems to interest me like people that make a big comeback or you know Orel Hershiser things like that
 And I like to read books on improve like family marriage you know things that are written by like Christian authors or doctors about family and you know how to improve your home and all that kind of thing 
 I like to re- 
 the magazines I 
 to rel- 
 I like to read 
 I read a lot of bicycling magazines 
 They're 
 I mainly look at the pictures and stuff 
 but they usually have some good articles in it
 But I don't know 
 I haven't really found any romance type stuff I like to read 
 I I'm more true you know fi- nonfiction 
 I haven't found a lot of fiction books that I really like 
 but not to say I wouldn't
 eventually I mean 
 *[[one utt or two with a29]] What was the last book you read
 Really
 Yeah
 Really
 I know 
 Yeah 
 I I set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is like about eleven more books than I would have read last year 
 but so far I've only read like two books 
 and so I'm not doing very well 
 but 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I find it's real hard 
 I let papers newspapers stack up and magazines stack up if I don't really set aside a time to look or read them
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I would too 
 *[[slash error]] Kind of train your mind
 *[[sv^2]] Have you ever read or heard of the book THIS PRESENT DARKNESS
 That was one of the books I read this year 
 and it's really fast paced and intense 
 It was a nonfiction book or is a fiction book 
 but it was ar- 
 it was one of the best I read 
 I mean it was real good 
 and it was it was one of the few books that 
 like it you know 
 just hurry up and go through without putting down you know
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I'm sure it's fast or something
 Uh-huh 
 I know what you mean

 I just sleep better or something
 But

 Yeah 
 Which what book have you read that is along those lines that was really good
 Well how about who 
 Do you know who it was about
