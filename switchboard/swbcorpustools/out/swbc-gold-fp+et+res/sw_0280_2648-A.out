 So well this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day 
 so 
 well what do you think is the pollutants the main pollutants in the air
 Yeah 
 well that's me too 
 After 
 on channel thirteen they had some some programs the day before 
 and I'm not sure that about yesterday we didn't really watch it too much yesterday 
 but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and you know how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do as the people 
 and and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot
 and that actually as our population increases and you know our of course our our cars you know our number of cars increase per the population that's the problem But also like you said the industry pollution 
 and you know they're reg- they're regulation that's placed on them is I mean it's better than it used to be 
 but it's incredible that they still don't have you know they don't they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air
 You know I I just 
 I can't stand that 
 and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that 
 you know they're supposed to be regulated because we have a we have a plant I don't know about T I but we have a plant a Pillsbury plant in in a town adjacent to ours 
 and I know people that work there that 
 of course you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals
 but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the what they do to make their dough and st- to clean out the flour and stuff like that 
 yeah
 I mean it's incredible 
 And they said that they're you know they have a little creek that runs by them 
 and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they you know shut down everything 
 and they clean up their act but on a normal basis that they're that they're dumping things that they're not supposed to be dumping 
 and I'm like if they're getting away with it can you imagine 
 that's a that's a Pillsbury plant 
 I can't imagine plants 
 Yeah 
 they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff you know to to break the flours down 
 and then they they also do testing there 
 and I don't 
 you know wh- when you consider you know it's probably not radioactive 
 but toxic can be can be anything that's cr- classified that can damage the Earth
 So there could be a lot of things that they could put you know that chemical wise that they use to that they are testing with that they're dumping 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I don't think they do the packaging at this plant
 but they do they do a lot of research 
 and they do they do do a lot of the refining up there 
 or 
 I'm not really 
 what's it called when you do flour 
 I'm not 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 But 
 I mean you think about it it you know 
 it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just 
 I'm not really sure 
 but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean- or stream or such
 or you can you can you know do testing on the ground itself at that point
 but when they pollute into the air and you've got you know and you've got movement through the air it's going to move a lot of that off 
 So I don't see you know how they can do some of the te- 
 unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution you know like in Los Angeles or or the bigger cities where it it tends to get stuck there 
 you know that you have a lot more particles in the air you know per per per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well I know out in some 
 I'm not sure 
 I can't remember the name of the county 
 it's it's where Stillwater is or sweet 
 no 
 I'm not sure 
 I know it 
 I think it's 
 I know we have a piece property there 
 it's called Dublin
 it's in Dublin Texas 
 I'm not really sure what the county 
 it's Stephen 
 no 
 Stephenville
 Okay 
 where Stephenville's at they've had a lot of problems because they've introduced a lot of dairies there
 so they have a lot of cattle in the area 
 I mean [ they've got like per per ya- per lot 
 you know they've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't th- th- 
 it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free
 they've got to have them there to be able to milk them 
 And they 
 and I read in this article I couldn't believe it where you know like one cow produces like a day produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure
 One cow 
 I was like my God 
 and they 
 and this thing says that that you know it- people think well cow manure is good for fertilizer 
 but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not it's not 
 when you know you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it 
 and they've added humus and stuff that breaks it down 
 and and this and this article said that they've got a real problem that you've got toxins and and bacteria in the manure that is 
 what it's doing is it's going through 
 they don't have a very deep o- 
 you know they're water they're natural water 
 I forget what that's called with you know 
 it's like a spring spring water
 but it's below the surface 
 it's not very far down
 and all this stuff is seeping through to the water
 and they're like they're afraid that you know within a certain amount of years that it's they're wa- they're water in that town will be totally polluted
 and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have polluted completely polluted so that they're you know there's too many toxins and bacterial growth
 and I'm like my God you know just from that one you know just from them introducing dairy farms in that one county
 No 
 not when you figure 
 I didn't realize a cow one cow produces that much manure 
 and they were talking like thousands of cows you know they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area 
 You 
 Well they are evidently 
 But I mean ev- evidently a normal cow produces that much too
 but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not you know a problem
 but when they get them in these tiny little areas you know and they've got a real big problem 
 and they they said that that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff and taking it to these like ponds that they had to filter it with 
 but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years they just overflow 
 and they overflow into the the creeks and stuff in the area 
 So that just creates 
 you know there there's 
 and it was just disgusting 
 it said the creeks will foam
 People people stand outside their houses and their watch the creeks foam brown and all
 and I'm just like my gosh 
 and the smell is really bad they sa- 
 Yeah 
 but I I don't know 
 it really frightens me though as far as the when you think about the you know thinking of just air pollution itself 
 and then and channel thirteen they're really emphasizing the problem with acid rain you know
 if we if we keep putting that stuff into the air and and you know if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for just the the Earth you know what the Earth is receiving back you know because how can you tell where it's going to come down at
 Yeah
 The rain forest and all
 Yeah
 Well they do because what is it carbon dioxide they use that where we can't synthesize it 
 and they're synthesizing it for us
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think we just have to 
 I don't know personally you know 
 I suppose you know if you just make sure your car is is working properly 
 and yo- 
 you know they're suppos- 
 nowadays they have the emission controls on them 
 but I think the only the main thing is just keep on the legis- your legislators back you know as far as 
 seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying okay we're really going to get involved 
 it it's really becoming a problem 
 By the year two thousand there will 
 what what are we going to have 
 what kind of results are we going to have for the environment
 And and what will we
