 Yes
 yes 
 It's about why there aren't more people that are voting and participating in 
 absolutely
 I think that it's kind of discouraging to 
 I have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing 
 and it's really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not 
 a lot of them are so ill informed they have no idea you know even that there's an election 
 or and these are people that are registered
 Well that's a thought
 
 I don't know 
 I I like that idea 
 I had a thought just a second ago 
 but it slipped my mind
 one thing that I- that I think probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more is because they don't know the candidates 
 And I think sometimes you know 
 that's one thing that I have learned in w- working in elections and things is you know sometimes even when you work for someone you don't really know what they're like 
 I know there's been a couple of people that we voted for and worked for 
 and when they got in office it was just a disaster 
 and and I'm not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them
 Absolutely
 That's right
 Now if you just lose if you just skip one election
 Three
 Uh-huh
 I think that's an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it
 No excuse 
 I'm not sure if I'm familiar with that or not
 Uh-huh
 I think that's great 
 
 Actually you know my husband has run for office before 
 and sometimes it's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because you know if you're going to be tied up that day campaigning or whatever it might be that kind of just kind of takes that load off you know 
 you can just go ahead and get that taken care of 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well hopefully once they have you know once they've checked them off the list 
 they they do have to check them off a list when they vote 
 so hopefully they couldn't
