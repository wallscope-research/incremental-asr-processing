 Uh-huh
 And a lot of hassle all year round 
 and cans laying 
 Yeah
 No 
 I read in the paper this week where maybe 
 I don't know if it w- was 
 I guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time
 But it it should be starting I would stay probably in the next month if if everything goes that 
 I'm not sure all what we're going to have to do whether we have three separate containers 
 I really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Well it would get messy too
 I I I know other places when they recycle they have to like wash out their glass jars and whatnot And which we're not in the habit of doing
 I was brought up you know long time ago that they didn't even have cans 
 They had bottles 
 and you'd return them to the the grocery store 
 and you'd get our money back 
 and that that was all well and good 
 They don't seem to still be doing that 
 If they could just eliminate the cans and use glass 
 but I guess this day and age they don't
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and they p- 
 I I think kids don't appreciate maybe the value of money that it's so little that they don't care 
 they can get more somewhere else
 for a good 
 right 
 They're 
 the nickels the dimes or what I suppose it might be quarters fifty cent pieces in these days that they would get they the kids just don't seem to to care that that much about a small amount of money
 But we we did buy a can crusher 
 and we are crushing cans 
 and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents 
 so I would say in the last three years we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before 
 it was just easier to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat
 So that's the main reason we're we sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles 
 Well as you say it takes a while to build it up 
 Since we've had the crusher all summer we I guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't ta- 
 I think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them to a a recycling place probably at one of the li-
