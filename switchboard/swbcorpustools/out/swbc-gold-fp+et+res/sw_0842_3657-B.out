 Ok- 
 Oops 
 well 
 Well okay 
 well let's let's fire away 
 well Brian
 Yeah 
 why don't you why don't we why don't you do about thirty seconds 
 and I'll do thirty seconds 
 and then we can work off of there
 Well since 
 well I guess since this time last year I've changed jobs within the firm I'm with
 and I now am learning to be a sys admin on on not only P Cs but pers- professional work stations as well
 And these are the big mamas i e sons Hewlett Packards sor- the big Solburns and and so forth
 And h- 
 and and we have two P Cs here 
 We have an X T 
 and then recently we we made a the command decision to go ahead and get the absolute top of the line because spouse is a programmer
 And so we got one that that could do enough and you know hold three different O Ss As far as DOS UNIX and O S Two
 So I I get to see all kinds of different applications
 No 
 no
 Learning 
 I'm learning t- I'm learning to be one who knows what's he's doing
 but expert 
 no 
 I frown on that that term because too many people s- you know misuse the word 
 so I'd rather say I'm I I am continually learning 
 but my area m- my level of expertise is increasing almost daily
 And yeah 
 so I've got a P C and a work station at work 
 and I 
 and we have two P Cs here w- at home
 And the 
 a lot of the the the new mama we're 
 I've got Aldus and Micrographics on it as far as technical publishing 
 and we do a quite a bit of church work with ours
 And 
 You know some 
 I I I've found that the more we do with it 
 it seem 
 and the Lord's just pleased that we're kind of 
 this is this is part of giving back a portion of what He's given to us
 So I don't mind because seems like the more we do there's there's the more stuff that's available that comes along and so forth
 And 
 So rather than being niggardly and and chintzy we've just said you bet boss seeing as he was the one that enabled us to get the money to buy the Four Eighty-Six
 Because the top of the line we've got 
 well we've got a compatible 
 It 
 Eight meg of ram and and two two two hundred and eleven hard drives
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Like I said we bought a real steam steam burner mainly because of spouse's UNIX because UNIX takes a a c- a well four megs minimum of RAM 
 and then it it it likes to live on about a hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive
 So the next size up was a Two Hundred and Eleven 
 and so rather than just have one we went ahead and got two 
 at some point in time I'm going to do the mirroring experiment to where one disk mirrors the other for fault tolerance
 And speak speak of the angel she just walked in 
 T I stuff <> 
 So 
 Yeah 
 she's she's a squirrel for contractor out at American Airlines
 So
