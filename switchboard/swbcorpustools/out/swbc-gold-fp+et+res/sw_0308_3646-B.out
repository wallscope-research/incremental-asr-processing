 Well I think they're they're having a lot of trouble right now 
 I know my son goes to a private school 
 but I think they're big city public schools by definition are having a a tough time right now just from probably from budget cuts and and everything else going on
 Well I had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school 
 so he's he has been going to private since kindergarten 
 So 
 he's loved it 
 He is a senior in high school this year 
 so he's 
 Yeah 
 he's done it the whole twelve and so many years 
 and it's been it's been really good for him
 overall on campus about twelve hundred but in the upper school upper four grades about four hundred and something 
 so it's maybe a hundred per grade
 Yeah 
 it really is
 Yeah 
 that was we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture 
 and he's done he's done really well 
 and just he was just ahead at an early age 
 and I didn't feel like in what was available particularly in the first three grades
 and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program
 And I just didn't think that was going get it 
 I thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead every day But yet still be with his peers age wise 
 You're just getting started
 Yeah 
 I know 
 That's a big problem 
 We wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school
 Wouldn't have thought of it 
 and and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe 
 and 
 Yeah 
 but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for for elders and adults and particularly in in responsible positions have not I don't think have had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases 
 and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands
 I guess I 
 Well the world changes 
 so I mean obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be
 I mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things 
 They have a whole lot more variety of things they they're that they see and do at an earlier age 
 so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time 
 but but still I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to to teach basic values and basic respectful of ness of authority
 And I just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore 
 Yeah 
 had to wear dresses didn't you
 And when it was skirts it was like get down on the floor 
 and we hold the ruler up here
 and it's no more than so many inches above the knee 
 Because it was mini skirt time back there at one time
 Yeah 
 I think that probably does have have something to do with it 
 and it's also 
 No 
 they do not do uniforms although one where he was between like second and eighth grade did
