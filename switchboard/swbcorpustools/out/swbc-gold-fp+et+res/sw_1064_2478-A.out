 right 
 up in T I out there
 right 
 Yeah 
 I just hit one then
 
 It 
 I got to 
 this is going to be fun 
 Are you Republican or Democrat
 Okay 
 well I'm a I'm a Democrat 
 so I was going to say if you're a Republican boy we would really have a good time
 Well I 
 to answer that one before we get to our subject you know I always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was though when it comes to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money 
 and they're the ones wasting all the money
 And I always wondered how they can play the money either way they want you know 
 I get a kick out of that 
 But anyway the subject go ahead 
 You first
 Yeah 
 I I don't think it's over 
 I think that so many other things have taken over in the media 
 But I think it was just plain greed 
 and I think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks 
 Go ahead loan your money out you know
 Yeah 
 I was talking to someone 
 I can't remember who it was 
 but he was a small businessman 
 and he said that the banks were calling 
 he borrowed some money 
 and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away 
 They just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property 
 and yeah 
 there there should be thousands of people in jail as far as I'm concerned
 Not just a couple
 Right
 Well I I agree a hundred percent 
 yeah
 It may have started with HUD too 
 I noticed that HUD was in terrible shape 
 and that was property 
 and they lost a lot of money there 
 and then some of these big these rich people started to 
 even Murchison here who owned the Cowboys had a lot of property down in Florida 
 This was several years ago 
 and he lost you know all all of his money before he died
 Not all of it 
 I don't know how much he lost 
 but they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit 
 and it always would it always would increase you know 
 it always would be more than what you paid for it 
 and they just never even got conservative with our money at all
 Right
 Yeah
 Well now the reason that I said that is because I was going to blame all Reaganomics for you know 
 you spend your way to prosperity 
 and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls I thought well that was the philosophy you know 
 Just keep spending until taxes are lower 
 and I thought that's not going to work you know 
 and I knew that it wasn't going to work originally
 And it hasn't worked now 
 Right 
 no doubt 
 no doubt
 yeah 
 I I I agree with that 
 but there's got to be some control 
 and apparently there was you know
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I know 
 no 
 I 
 Right
 And and not high quality ones at that you know
 Well I do have a lot of confidence in the the American people and the economy and everything else 
 I I feel bad when I see the inefficiency even here at T I you know 
 and I think that the 
 it it still 
 a lot of the workers don't understand that they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them you know
 Right
 I know 
 and I when I 
 of course I'm in facilities 
 and I work with a lot of mechanics 
 and I just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce you know 
 and they think that well I'm paid anyway 
 so it doesn't matter you know
 Right 
 Right
 Yeah 
 really 
 You don't sound like a nonexempt Jim
 You don't sound like a nonexempt
 you're too informed 
 They're they're very they're very not interested 
 They wouldn't even talk probably about some of the things we're talking about now
 I guess I'm dealing with too many Texas mechanics here 
 I don't know really
 I'm being a Yankee I guess I'm I'm letting my Yankee come out you know
 Yeah
 well that's good
 No 
 right 
 I mean that's good that you're degreed
 your time will come 
 We 
 I know a few people 
 really 
 what 
 are you in a tech 
 like do you do technician work or something
 quality okay
 Yeah
 yeah 
 Well now is is really terrible 
 I'm management level facilities 
 and when the cuts came three of us got bounced back 
 and so we're just 
 I'm calling you from work 
 I'm I'm covering weekends and nights now 
 I'm I'm one of the manager reps 
 there's three of us to cover in Dallas facilities 
 and just we're essentially standby and problems all all nights and weekends 
 That's my 
 I only get one weekend off a month right now 
 I call it my recession job
 being basically an engineer and liking doing installation work well there's not any 
 I mean there is literally is no installation work going on
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it it 
 Banking
 I think that not not only T I but a lot of it when they talk about 
 there was one point I was going to make 
 I think the last I heard 
 and I I have to admit I'm not as informed as them 
 but there's something like about eighty six billion that they admit 
 Well I always double that 
 I figure well if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty-six billion it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes 
 and so if that's true it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was that went down the tube somewhere
 Yeah 
 It's amazing really 
 It's amazing that 
 yeah 
 I know what you mean
 Course your value of homes up there are pretty good 
 I mean here they're not really that high 
 but are they pretty good up there
 really
 Well we're in the metroplex here you know 
 and it it 
 I die every time companies like General Dynamics 
 they they lost several contracts 
 and and I don't know if you noticed yesterday you probably don't pay attention to the Bell Helicopter you know 
 they were going to have big award 
 and Secorski got it Which was Boeing Secorski this which is up in the north somewhere you know
 And I don't know how Bell didn't get it 
 Well I I don't 
 they were advertising here that it was Bell T I 
 T I was getting the electronics with Bell 
 and so it was a double 
 One that Bell is in the Metroplex 
 and two that T I was doing the electronics for them
 And they they advertised that that it was T I Bell T I Bell and then all of a sudden Secorski got it yeah 
 Secorski Boeing 
 Boeing doesn't need the money 
 Something 
 I almost think there's some politics around here because the metroplex here in the Dallas Fort Worth area the with T I 
 I don't know if T I has lost as much as everybody else 
 but General Dynamics and L T V and Bell have lost project after project you know
