 Well I own the company
 I'm the president and C E O of the company
 So I guess I determine what the benefits are 
 But so what are you asking me 
 what what benefits I think are most important
 I'd say in today's economy besides basic benefits such as health insurance and life insurance and the some type of retirement plan I'd say that most of the employees that we have really like a a profit sharing plan
 They like to participate in the profits of the company like they're you know 
 because they feel like well we're contributing to it 
 so we'd like to participate in it 
 and so that means I make a little bit less 
 but the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in in it working
 Right 
 I think most people don't want money 
 it's been my experience most people want to feel like they're participating in something that that is not a drudgery you know that they enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of
 Right
 Yeah
 well our people get a lot of satisfaction 
 we're a financial planning firm
 Yes
 You said you retired 
 I just happen to have a person that I happened to do some planning for this morning 
 but anyway we do we deal with a lot of people that are retired or trying to retire 
 and it's real important that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that where they were that that it take care of them 
 They don't 
 none of them really want to be rich 
 but they like to have enough to be comfortable
 Well we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a a salary is is tie a percentage of business that that a person would participate and bring into the company 
 pay them based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary 
 And the re- 
 No 
 not necessarily 
 it can be in-house people who help you handle X amount of dollars 
 Right 
 well see we have dif- we have marketing people 
 and then we have financial planners 
 and then we have staff secretaries and administrative assistants 
 and these secretaries and administrative assistants you know if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company they they can get very dissatisfied very quickly
 And so we're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle 
 So administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business 
 And 
 Well and and but to 
 see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to or that they usually have several people they report to that you know that they work together with it encourages them not to complain when they realize that they get a part of the of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying well make me do it
 See we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it 
 I don't think anyb- any 
 I think most people want to be lack of better term- terminology they want to be self-employed 
 but they don't want to take the risk 
 In other words they like to control their own future 
 but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please without some real strict adherence 
 which 
 that's what we have
