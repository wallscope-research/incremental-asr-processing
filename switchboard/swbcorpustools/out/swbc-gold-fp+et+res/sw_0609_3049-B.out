 I gue- I think we rented PRETTY WOMAN a couple weeks months ago
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I have not done that one 
 I don't know if I have even heard of that one
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 COCOON
 Okay
 okay
 I think I know who you are talking about though
 Okay
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 I'm trying to think 
 just the other night on H B O we watched THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER again 
 and that's one that 
 Yeah 
 I was going to read while it was on 
 but then when it started I just couldn't you know read 
 That was a really good movie
 Yeah 
 there's quite a few movies out now that I would like to go see 
 My husband is not a real big movie goer
 and I guess more than anything that is why we don't go
 Plus by the time you get a baby-sitter and then pay to go to the movies it just gets pretty expensive
 No 
 I stay at home
 Yeah 
 Go during the day 
 that's right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 
 Robert De Niro
 I think you said Peter
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well you know I think I read about that too
 Yeah
 you haven't 
 I've heard that is wonderful
 Yeah
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I've heard that's 
 we we rented the other one 
 I was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately was PRESUMED INNOCENT with Harrison Ford 
 I guess he's in there
 And I thought that was really good
 It was the one where he was a defense 
 not defense 
 he was a prosecu-cuter
 And there was a murder of one of the women that was in the the D A's office
 And then he ended up being accused of it
 Yeah 
 so I mean it really kind of had a turn at the end when you found out who it was 
 I was never into those movies either
 Yeah 
 I thought he looked real good with a beard too
 Yeah
 What was the last one 
 I'm trying to think
 the last 
 like BACK TO THE FUTURE then was the last one 
 okay 
 trying to Yeah
