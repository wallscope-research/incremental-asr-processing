 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well that 
 I know wh- 
 the things that we kind of looked at is is you want to see how many teachers you have And and how many kids they have and how they break it up
 Because we had we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in
 It it was a really good one 
 and in fact it worked out for us because my wife we kind of bartered 
 My wife did artwork for them 
 and then you know so we got our day care free
 But they didn't have enough teachers 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 Yeah 
 Did did they separate them by age group
 Because I'd think you know I think that's one thing that was important
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I- it sound 
 yeah 
 It sounds like to me your your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people Affectionate people that they're they're kind of par- may be parents themselves or something
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I I think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and P H D's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff 
 but if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good
 Yeah
 Yeah
 An- 
 The other the other group that we had was kind of interesting 
 The other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team
 and we knew them from other associations 
 but it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one 
 and I think you know she would she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff you know 
 but he was actually the more the more what demonstrative type The more loving 
 he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids 
 and and i- it was kind of interesting to see that that it was actually the man in the group that that did that side of it 
 An- 
 Yeah 
 so they had a really nice balance 
 We liked that one 
 In fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something
 but they also did they also did some of the teaching things 
 and then they had you know 
 obedience obedience was important
 And you know so they you know they used I think they used the 
 you probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself
 And it's it's one 
 I can't remember what they call it actually 
 but y- you just stand them in front of a clock 
 and you know it has a second-hand that goes around
 And they have to stand there
