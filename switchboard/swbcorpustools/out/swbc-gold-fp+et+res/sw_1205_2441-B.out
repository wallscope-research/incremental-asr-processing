 No 
 I haven't either
 Yeah
 Most countries require that now 
 they you know they have it mandatory for for the the at least the young men 
 I don't know about the young women 
 I don't know if they have to serve in the military too
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Is that right
 I bet
 You have to
 Yeah 
 my father had been in the military 
 I didn't do it myself 
 My father had 
 and that's how he put himself through school basically
 He came from a poor immigrant family 
 and he didn't have a chance to you know 
 the family wasn't wealthy 
 so he had to do something to put himself through school 
 and he did 
 And he was very successful
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's pretty good
 That's good
 Yeah 
 that's 
 I don't know 
 There's other kinds of service to the country that could be done you know
 I mean working in the national parks working clean up the roadsides
 I mean I've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend [ at least part of their time + *[[why no slash]] not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job but <> at least some of their time ] to look for to go out and clean up the roads You know 
 I mean 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 we'd learn service to other people in this country
 Country would benefit
 I mean 
 That right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 What I hear one time I think it was on Paul Harvey's radio segment that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars
 I mean I was astounded 
 I don't even make that
 Yeah 
 and somebody's taking that away
 Yeah 
 no doubt
 Is that right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It's sad
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 What would happen if the required young people to do service to the country 
 what should they get in return I wonder 
 Like 
 Yeah
 Educational or vocational training or something
 And they'll help the country eventually too because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people
 and that's only going to help
 Yeah
 Yeah
 As opposed to what we were twenty years ago
 Yeah 
 because they have the ambition I guess
 Yeah 
 which is good for them 
 but on the other hand we kind of lose out
 I think that if young people had service to the country might give them more ambition Because they learn that serving other people is a good thing
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 god you go to the mall 
 and you see you know fourteen year old kids flaunting money because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night you know
 for what
 Give me the money 
 and I'll I'll teach them something good 
 Yeah
 No 
 They've they've relinquished their parenting
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I mean I talked with somebody else about that another time 
 and you know when I's in graduate school working on my master's degree in math I was teaching as part of my part of the program 
 And I just love teaching 
 That was a lot that's probably the most fun I had 
 And it helped me out because I learned things and learned how to do things differently
 And when when come time to get out of school I thought Boy I'd like to teach 
 But you know for for what
 You know I don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life
 I mean that that's a sad thing to think 
 and that's kind of selfish on my part 
 and I admit that
 Yeah 
 that's right
 That's wrong
 I'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less 
 I saying teachers should be paid more
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 They both have their place
 But you know when it gets right down to it 
 That's pretty good
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 And they served a good function
 I remember the company my dad worked for the people there went on strike against the management 
 It was a steel manufacturing place 
 and they 
 this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap 
 and they were having a hard time 
 And they told the strikers there look 
 we need you to come back and get this stuff done 
 Or else we're going to be out of business 
 And they wouldn't come back 
 so they went bankrupt
 And and they all lost their jobs
 And it's like you know 
 Yeah
 That's right
 And they're trying to do that now with the imports
 It'll be a tough road though 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's about right
 It teaches them pride in their country
 That's right
 Yeah
 that's right 
 That's like Eagle Scouts
 And that's a great idea
