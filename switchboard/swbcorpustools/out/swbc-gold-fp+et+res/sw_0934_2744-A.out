 Uh-huh 
 I think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system as far as people dropping out of school grades on test scores being low more and more people taking G E Ds trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school
 You know something must be wrong as far as mak- not just the teaching techniques but just motivation within within the schools themselves
 Uh-huh
 it's okay
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 and I know 
 I work around you know a lot of teachers 
 and I u- I understand how supportive they are of their students and how excited they are
 but some how I don't think the students are getting excited
 yes 
 definitely 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Progress 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 not not even that much probably
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And speaking speaking of doing what you want just in society today being that it's nineteen ninety-one a lot of teenagers and young people have a lot more freedom as far as what they do as far as you know even even something as simple as staying up late watching television late going out late start dating 
 you start dating too early you know
 just little things like that that do start in the home
 that can that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day or more in school 
 and so any other part of your life that's going to definitely affect your school life because you spend so much time there
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I talked to a guy the other day 
 and he is now in in a program that's trying to get him out of high school because he he fell back several years ago 
 and he's going to he he will have gone to school five years
 and the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died
 and he was having to support his entire family take care of his brothers and sisters you know
 and all that had an adverse affect on his school life
 And yeah 
 and that and that's a perfect example of how your home life you know plays a definite part 
 And you know any other aspect of your life 
 an but now now that he's in this program and you know he's I guess okay 
 he's he's making straight As 
 and you know it just it it was there it was just I guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right 
 exactly
 Uh-huh
 Ex- exactly 
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 When people start talking about programs that help for me I don't care if it's socialist 
 or I don't care as long as it's something that's going to do some good or that looks like it could be beneficial
 I mean that's the point I'm at now 
 I mean that's the point we all should be at is like finding some solution
 I mean you know nothing totally radical 
 but if it's something that you know might help you know 
 because there's not a lot being done
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Take them out
 Yeah 
 not very far at all
 Uh-huh
 I mean it's it's almost like 
 Right 
 right
 Right
 An a lot of it a lot of the parents now are so young
 You know that they're they still they still don't know what's going on 
 and how are they supposed to you know teach their kids that are coming up you know what's going on 
 I mean it's just it's a vicious cycle that we're you know dead smack dead in the center of 
 and we have to try to swim out 
 You know kind of like the Bermuda Triangle 
 we're just sinking 
 and it's almost impossible to swim back up
 But yeah 
 there's definitely problems
 its just the solutions that you know they're going to be in our political system 
 they're going to be on everyone's mind for quite a while too long
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 there's there's 
 right 
 There's definitely too much leeway as far as 
 I mean I've only been out of I've been out of college only two years
 and you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out 
 and I I already you know I really didn't I really don't see myself going back to school or anything 
 but I appreciate more what I had
 And I had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm
 and I just didn't take as much advantage of it as I should have
 No 
 I went to U T at Austin 
 uh-huh
 So I mean all kinds of resources and you know just there
 and I'd give anything to have that right now in my in my regular li- 
 I mean you you have everything given to you 
 I don't see why people wouldn't want that 
 I don't know 
 I 
 but then if I was young I wouldn't see it
 But you know now that it's gone I 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah 
 I did a lot 
 and I experienced a lot 
 and I I feel like I got a good college education 
 but just when I got out I feel like I should have spent more time in the library 
 I should have taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were you know
 the informal classes that you don't get credit for you know
