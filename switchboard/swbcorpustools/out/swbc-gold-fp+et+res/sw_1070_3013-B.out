 Well I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool 
 and it's it's just really pretty easy 
 It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring
 And I like that 
 the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in in it 
 and then I you're supposed to do chicken 
 but I just use those little cans of chicken
 And it makes it so much easier 
 and so you dump the rice 
 you dump the chicken 
 and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape 
 now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off 
 but I get my kids to do that 
 so 
 I I don't have to do that 
 And and it really 
 and you mix it all up with ye- 
 there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up 
 but it's so simple 
 and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it has to sit in the fridge over night 
 but but it's really good
 And I like that one
 Yeah
 Exactly
 Uh-huh
 that sounds good
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 And these days that helps doesn't it
 Yeah
 I know what you mean
 Now spaghetti's such an easy one 
 I do that a lot
 I do spaghetti a lot
 Yeah 
 I don't like to do that i- if it's ho- real hot though
 Because I don't know 
 I have a real thing about being hot in the in the summertime
 I guess
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that's right 
 And we don't entertain that often 
 but when we do I'm like you I like it to be fast and easy And something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's exactly like us from our church we just do it 
 yeah
 
 Well you see all that on T V 
 and I could never be that person
 It just I'm just not 
 well I'm so I'm pretty laid back
 And you know so I don't I know a lady in a my church 
 and she like does her own bread and does her own stuff 
 and so when she does food she really goes all out 
 and I don't know how she can do it and be calm 
 I guess
 No 
 I don't
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 how exciting
 Yeah 
 Well I usually start about six and an and cook and then eat at seven I mean co- cook at five and eat at six rather
 Yeah 
 and my family and I we're a sit down together family
 yeah 
 I don't like the run in and out part
 And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an and my husband about what's happened 
 and I think I that was ingrained in me during my family time at home
 And you know we could learn to talk about things 
 and I think that's good
 Yeah 
 I think 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 
 Well that happens to us sometimes too
 But sometimes if something is on that they want to watch I leave it on 
 but we eat in the kitchen 
 and their heads are always poking past the door
 Yeah 
 Anyway food is is a real life-style kind of thing 
 and i- some people don't like to do this 
 but I like to co- cook with my kids
 And if they're going to have other kids over then then they help 
 And we make real simple things you know those 
 I don- I don't know if you've ever made them maybe not since you don't have kids yet but those Jell-O gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers I can't think of what they call it
 Yeah 
 they're so simple
 And the kids love to do that 
 finger food is is a biggie with them
 And and like now one thing I wish I could find a a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that 
 and it's just really hard 
 and if you have to work with a knife I don't like that
 So that's 
 they like to eat it 
 but it's a hard one to have to to prepare
 But they like that with the the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 My son's getting to be a a real good cook 
 so 
 sometimes he fixes me breakfast 
 Yeah 
 I like it 
 I like it a lot
 He's eleven
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 so hi- 
 not every morning 
 mostly during the summer it's hit and miss 
 and we usually have like cold cereal or something like that
 during the su- during wintertime when they're in school then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a twice a week or something and then have like when it's really cold I even cook oatmeal Because I like oatmeal 
 and the loo- they like it all right
 And then sometimes we do something 
 it has to be fast because they're on their way to school 
 we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that 
 but 
 Yeah 
 so I try to 
 and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that 
 I used to do them in the microwave 
 but they don't like that
 
 It de- it depends 
 If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray 
 You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray 
 and they will be a little harder 
 and I don't like that
 So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in if you have a microwave book 
 but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a like a plate over the top
 And let it steam
 And then and then stir it up
 Yeah 
 an and that turns out okay
 And it's funny 'cause if I turn them out on to a di- i- on to like a plate for them to take what they want they don't know I've ever done it in a microwave
 It's really funny 
 it's very deceiving you know 'cause if they see it with their eyes they go I don't like want that you know 
 and yet if they don't ever see it th- then it's like this tastes okay you know 
 so 
 Anyway 
 Yeah
