 Okay 
 When they first said the subject my mind went kind of blank 
 I thought Gee I haven't taken anything back for a long time
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Of course 
 uh-huh
 Right
 right 
 just to get you by five years 
 and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed
 We're we're a wasteful society for sure
 Right
 Right
 And you usually get what you pay for 
 We bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for Christmas 
 and they were like ten dollars 
 and we expected them to work nice for the little kids 
 and they didn't work worth anything 
 So we took those back 
 and that's about that 
 all that were taken back in ages
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 really
 It's hard
 wow
 Uh-huh 
 and it just pertained to that 
 I at first I thought of food you know because that's what mainly what I buy 
 it seems like 
 and you know I still don't have any anything to do there 
 but But I I think too a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one 
 so 
 Yeah 
 my husband is really good at fixing things too 
 so he usually be able to fix anything that's minor 
 and and that has saved us thousands of dollars you know from to mechanic to anything like that
 but but it was interesting to 
 I don't know if they're making them better or not 
 I it's hard to say 
 Some I think they more of their parts plastic which you know makes things break easier 
 but I think the technology is better
 About quality
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right 
 Well people aren't willing to pay those prices very often so you know for a handcrafted something 
 so 
 so 
 So if we get what we what we deserve
