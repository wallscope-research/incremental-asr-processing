 I just sort of blanking tonight 
 I just got done saying I just saw one fairly recently 
 gosh I know the one with the two girls that take off from a- across across the country on a crime spree
 THELMA AND LOUISE 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 it really is 
 it's it's interesting
 yeah 
 I enjoyed it 
 I was going to go see the Billy Crystal movie also which was 
 I'm a little bit behind 
 I usually rent them 
 this is the 
 just the one 
 gosh 
 it was the CITY SLICKERS 
 right
 Have you seen that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I I've heard lots of good things about it 
 and I would have would have liked to have seen it 
 but I was with my wife 
 and I figured she'd like THELMA AND LOUISE better 
 so 
 And I'd heard it was really good too 
 so 
 No
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 there's there's been a a fair number of of pretty good movies out recently
 I mean it kind of runs in in batches 
 I mean for a while sometimes they come in a whole bunch of them that just I don't even you know doesn't even sound like something I want to see
 What what kind of movies in general do you like to watch
 Uh-huh
 No 
 in fact I'm not even familiar with it 
 I don't think
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh 
 <> No 
 in fact I I I'll I'll look for it because I 
 Actually yeah 
 my wife's from down in that region around the s- the called the the Seven Missions which are which are right down in this where I'm sure where it was filmed at
 And I'm sure that that would make it worth worth her watching 
 She 
 my my my movie watching has has severely has has changed a lot since I got married
 Yeah 
 she she likes action movies and and and comedies 
 and so anything that's has anything little is a little little bit less than sort of mainstream Hollywood is is boring to her 
 [ And + and so [ I I I I really I used to watch a fair number of foreign films 
 I used to watch a lot of sort of the less the less popular films
 And I find I don't do it anymore or else I have to watch them on my own
 Find something both of you will watch
 She 
 it's funny because most women aren't really 
 she's sort of Schwarzenegger fan type of
 Yeah 
 she really likes all these gory shoot them up films
 Keep her on the edge of her seat
 I'll watch them you know 
 they're kind of fun to watch in a way
 But so it it it varies 
 I don't seem to get you know as much variety these days lately as I used to
 Well yeah 
 on the other hand you know given that my wife likes those I I say I occasionally like to watch them 
 and and so you know so it's you can always count on her to watch something like that 
 And she'll even watch things like karate movies and stuff like that You know which most most women now won't 
 they won't come within ten feet of All the all the ya All the sounds of the karate chops flying through the air 
 A-cha 
 I s- 
 yeah 
 I speak several 
 but I I don't mind watching subtitle movies 
 No 
 I I 
 Yeah
 I mean for some people that's just you know that's out of the question you know 
 You give it subtitles they won't watch
