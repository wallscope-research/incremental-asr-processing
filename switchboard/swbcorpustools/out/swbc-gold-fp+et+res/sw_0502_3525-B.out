 I think golf isn't it
 Are you a hacker
 I know I I know I did 
 I know I did
 Course I know I watch my thirteen year old play now you know 
 and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Yeah
 That's what it takes 
 you you need to play that often to get a really good handicap 
 Well I went to 
 I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more 
 and I I went after it 
 and did and I really didn't find much improvement 
 Fact ever time I'd start trying to correct something it seemed like the score would *[[listen]] go go back up 
 yeah 
 I I think I need to 
 I probably need to take some some more lessons more current and and practice more often 
 Spend more time on the 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah 
 I'm familiar with it
 yeah 
 if you play regular I think it makes a big difference
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I well I've also found too I I try to work out regularly 
 and when I am doing that and feeling loose and that I swing better 
 I I I get through the ball better 
 and I also if I 
 I found as I've gotten a little older here I worry less about my distance
 And I 
 my control is a little bit better there
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Have you ever have you ever tried a one iron
 Uh-huh
 Well you know I put mine back in my bag this year too 
 and I I used a three wood rather than a driver
 I had a lot more control on it 
 I sacrificed distance 
 but I wasn't in trouble every time I got down the fairway
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 absolutely
 Yeah 
 well I I read recently here they say if you're playing if you're scoring well you should play more 
 If you're scoring poorly you should spend more time on the practice g- range 
 I think there is less flus- frustration factor there too 
 So but I I 
 the one iron is something I've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that I I should pick one up and try to start 
 Apparently they're very difficult to play with 
 but with practice I would imagine you could groove that swing too 
 And I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron 
 it's incredible
 And but and his accuracy is what's so startling with it 
 And I 
 and it but it's an iron that he's really practiced with 
 He has used a lot 
 and it would be fun to get that good at a with an iron distance iron 
 And get away without embarrassing yourself 
 right
