 I'm great 
 Yeah
 No 
 I don't have one at home 
 I work with one on at work continually you know 
 but I do not have one of my own at home
 What do you have at home
 Uh-huh
 Right
 From the oldies but the goodies
 It's probably pretty close to what I have because I have the same kind of thing at work 
 I have a three eighty-six S X which is T I computer 
 but everything in is in I B M mode 
 So 
 Do you use it a lot at home
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 So you're on it a lot
 Uh-huh
 I was amazed when I took our taxes to our tax person 
 and she works out of her home also
 And the software that does the taxes is just incredible
 You know I mean she just you know 
 I expected to go and you know drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later 
 And you know she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little P C
 It was great
 That's wonderful 
 I have often thought that that having one at home would be neat 
 I just don't know if we would really use it that much You know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 definitely 
 definitely 
 I know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer I guess probably three years ago for Christmas 
 and you know it's got some stuff on it 
 It's got a nice little word processing software on it you know and some budgeting type things and stuff 
 And I don't think she's ever touched it you know 
 It just it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home 
 You know she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer you know 
 So 
 Yeah 
 just as quickly
 Now I know my boss has bought the software that he can that his checkbook is on on on a disk 
 and he goes in and prin- and types his checks on the screen and then hits print 
 and they print out on the checks 
 and he's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places you know 
 and he just whips out you know 
 I saw him yesterday morning over there 
 and and he paid his monthly bills 
 and he just you know wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print 
 and it printed out like ten checks 
 and he just you know 
 they're perforated 
 and he just ripped them off 
 They go through just a continuous thing on the printer
 and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes 
 and there they went 
 You know and he said you know I can balance my checkbook in seconds you know because it's all in the computer you know 
 So 
 That's exactly why 
 He said you know he said used to be I always sat looking for those you know 
 He said this way there isn't any 
 You know it does it for you 
 So This you know 
 there are some definitely some some advantages to it 
 It's just a matter of like you say are the advantages does it justify the cost if you're using it strictly for personal business 
 So 
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah
 As he grows up he'll be even more and more too
 That'll be great
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Well yeah 
 I 
 Well I'm going through right now 
 I'm you know going part time in the evenings 
 and you know I do 
 yeah 
 everything has to be typed 
 I mean they require it 
 You have to type it you know 
 and and so I'm up here you know nights and weekends you know working on the little p- on the P C up here you know typing stuff 
 So I can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home you know if you were going to school
 Well you 
 I don't know
 No 
 no 
 and they probably used to have it 
 I just finished a a major research paper a couple of weeks ago 
 and I couldn't imagine not having that thing on a disk where I could go back in and move stuff around and change it 
 I I don't know what they used to do before they 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 and you had to type all of his papers
 gosh
 cut your time in half at least
 At least
 Uh-huh
 You do the whole thing over
 That's right 
 You know I remember when I was working in high school you know I was working in an office right after I got out of high school 
 I continued working there for probably another year 
 And we did everything on a typewriter everything 
 But it's amazing you know 
 then when where you know someone would have you type a letter they did it right they did it right 
 I mean they were 
 Yeah 
 they sit there 
 and they go is this really what I want to say 
 and you typed it 
 and that was it 
 and now you know people just send it back over and over and over and over
 Well we'll try this out and see what it looks like 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 instead of knowing what they want to say before they eve- they just you know play with it and which in a way is nice to be able to do 
 but you know it it gets a little out of hand sometimes 
 I've seen it get out of hand up here you know where we've got a secretary that sits over here that's keeping metrics right now and keeping up you know of all the letters I type how many cha- how many of them do I make changes on And on each letter what types of changes 
 Are they typos 
 Are they because I couldn't read it 
 or people just change a like one word because they think it sounds better or whatever 
 And you know she's also keeping a percentage you know what percentage of letters am I retyping for whatever reason
 And there's like one week she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed you know 
 and it's like you know it's ridiculous 
 and that was that was the high week 
 but it's running about seventy which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types
 Well that's exactly right 
 You know she keeps you know keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show you know look this didn't really need to be changed 
 You know this is ridiculous and you know changing add this time to now
 You know I mean that's the kind of things you know that she's keeping and showing that this was a big waste of time it was a waste of paper it was a waste you know to change something like that 
 So Anyway maybe you know maybe it'll it'll help in some way 
 but I don't know 
 There there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative
 Without a doubt 
 Without a doubt 
 Well I would like to get one at home some day 
 We've got a two year old son 
 and so you know some day I would like to get even just like the video tell or something like that you know just to to be able to pull in sources from outside would be wonderful 
 You know so 
 I do too 
 I do too 
 The on line encyclopedia just sounds wonderful 
 you know that sounds like such a great idea 
 you know it'd be kind of fun to be able to play with it 
 So I know my father had a P C 
 and when we were in high school it was always fun 
 We could link in 
 and I don't even remember now what it was called 
 But you could link in and talk to other peo- talk to people all over the country you know
 And like you have your own little code name you know 
 and you'd type in du du du Hi how are you du du du 
 and they'd type back and everybody 
 and you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time 
 and everything everybody said prints out on your screen as they're typing it 
 and it was just great fun you know 
 It was very expensive because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance you know 
 It was like a long distance phone call 
 So we were each limited to like twenty minutes a day you know 
 so 
 it added up big 
 Well you know we my parents were divorced 
 and so the time we were like visiting our father in the summer time you know 
 so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it
 I'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations you know 
 But when you're doing the guilty father complex you know because he's not there to watch us grow you can kind of get all kinds of stuff
 That's sad 
 Well it was nice to talk to you
 Have a 
 You too
 Bye
