 I know a little bit about it 
 I'm not a die-hard fan 
 but I I enjoy the 
 I like the Boston Red Sox myself
 Uh-huh
 Well with 
 their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the rest of the team lately 
 so 
 Right 
 it's amazing
 Right
 Well fortunately the Red Sox last time I saw the paper earlier this week were in first place and doing quite well
 I've been really busy at work this past week 
 and normally on my way into work I'll pick up a newspaper 
 and i- 
 so every day I'll have a newspaper at work 
 and when I take a break I'll take a look at the newspaper 
 But this week I've been so busy I didn't even bother to stop 
 But hopefully hopefully next week I'll get back to my normal routine
 Well not really 
 I I work at laboratory
 From 
 I'm an officer in the Air Force
 and they have a speech lab across the hall from us
 And the speech laboratory does some work with T I at not in my office 
 but in my division they do quite a bit of speech work
 Sure 
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 I prefer to 
 I I like 
 I never used to really like watching football that much 
 but more and more these days I'm I'll like a football game 
 but I've always liked baseball
 I I prefer to watch 
 I guess I'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football 
 And I I'd much rather go to a baseball game than to a football game
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well 
 Well there's injuries in a lot of sport
 I'd I 
 Uh-huh
 baseball 
 it's true 
 I I would say that baseball tends to be one of the less troublesome sports
 but for some people it's just 
 Well that 
 not so much that 
 but even in baseball you can 
 like when I played baseball when I was growing up I had trouble just throwing the ball because I wa- very I was always very strong 
 and I could- th- 
 when I was young I could throw harder than my like ligaments and all that should have been allowed to
 And so I was always throwing my arm out and having trouble 
 I and I was a catcher 
 so I was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and k- that kind of stuff 
 So I 
 that was always a problem for me was just just the constant throwing 
 so 
 No 
 I did that wrestling 
 No 
 I'd 
 well I I always been quite an athlete and doing different things 
 and the other thing was I'd never really let injuries stop me 
 But interestingly enough you mentioned football is like 
 now I won't play football anymore because of the the separated shoulder wrestling
 so but I stood the stood the injury wrestling 
 but it 
 as long as I let it heal it never really bothered me 
 then playing football this fall I it was just flag football too I separated it again 
 and it seemed to be like the straw that broke the camels back 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 My God
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Are you on you on any leagues now
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Well my grandmother has been bowling for gosh maybe thirty forty years 
 I don't know
