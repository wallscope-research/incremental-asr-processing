 Okay 
 well go ahead 
 I'll let you start
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 or it could be like the draft where you know before they draft you they ta- you get a physical anyway 
 So when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical 
 and if there's nothing physically wrong with you then you're drafted 
 It doesn't matter how rich you are
 That would be good
 What did you say
 yeah
 
 Uh-huh 
 that's true
 Well that's true 
 America's paying all this money to have other people give aid to other countries 
 so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time
 Because actually when you when you do service overseas you end up learning something usually that's that's really useful plumbing or farming or or something like that 
 so you're really learning a skill 
 <> What did you say 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I think well that's probably the idea 
 I don't know whether the idea is to be within the country or outside the country
 Yeah 
 that would be neat 
 yeah 
 sort of like an exchange program
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that'd be sort of neat 
 I like the idea of being a mandatory thing for welfare 
 Course that's what 
 that's sort of like what Truman had 
 or was it Roosevelt 
 I can't remember 
 with the big 
 Yeah
 Getting people 
 the the work program and all the all the make work jobs 
 That was sort of public service in a way all the highways they started building
 What did you say
 Yeah 
 that's true a lot of them are still out there
 Like all these wonderful highways in West Virginia and no one knows why
 Lake what
 Caddo Lake
 No 
 I've never heard of it
 Oh 
 okay 
 real pretty like a swamp 
 yeah
 okay 
 yeah 
 I been 
 I got talked to someone else before that was a a Texan 
 but I guess that's that's what we're going to have 
 This is a T I experiment to see how talk/
 Texans talk to other people
 Virginia
 yeah 
 it is neat to get other people Especially since you got other ideas about how people how people react to things and stuff Especially when it comes to social services 
 I'm glad they have a lot of you know topics on social services because like this thing this is a pretty good idea 
 I didn't even know if they were thinking about it/
 I wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone somewhere is really thinking that it would be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service
 Politicians pushing it or or Mitch Snider Or Mitch Snider 
 okay 
 well see that's a D C thing 
 Mitch Snider is the the advocate for the homeless that he he's said it out here in Washington 
 but he started the the movement for creative nonviolence
 Yeah 
 he started that 
 and that that was basically a you know donate time and money to help the homeless 
 but Excus- 
 the other topic was like I said something about politicians 
 I can't remember exactly what it was 
 It was real general statement 
 Gee whiz 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 that would be neat 
 I'd have to basically say my birth
 *[[humor]] Uh-huh 
 Well that would be sort of interesting because then you get people from other countries I mean other parts of the state you know 
 of course Pittsburgh would say you know find the better cheaper ways of burning coal you know
 Cleaner ways of burning coal 
 and people in the South would say don't burn coal you know
 we have a lot of coal 
 But it's it's a dirty fuel that's for sure
 Excuse me How did I get into it 
 I'm an electrical engineer here in Virginia
 No
 no 
 they 
 I'm in a telecommunications company 
 and they sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers wanted to participate you know 
 not really 
 I mean no more than any other company you know 
 we buy their parts just as much as anybody else 
 But no no real association with T I other than being in the same industry electronics industry 
 They just they just sent out a letter to everybody they do business with saying that you know if you're interested we're doing a study 
 and and since 
 I don't know 
 no 
 I don't
 Right
 What do you think 
 what 
 Get
 I don't know
 Get your own you're going to get you own T I seven thirty-two or something
 I didn't hear about that 
 Probably for T I employees
 your not 
 *[[typo your> you're]] you don't work for Texas Instruments
 okay
 Oh
 Oh
 that's a neat idea
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 well he's gotten a good mix 
 I was saying because I've 
 like I said I heard some other people talking that they've talked to different people in different states and stuff
 That's good especially since you call that one eight hundred number 
 so so probably knock T I profits margin way down 
 Yeah 
 right 
 this is probably some government study program/
 Okay 
 Okay 
 well I enjoyed talking with you
 I'm going to save my two year old from the pile of grapes she's diving into
 Okay 
 we'll I'll talk to you
 Bye-bye
