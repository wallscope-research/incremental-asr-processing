 All righty 
 I guess our topic today is air pollution 
 And we are to just discuss what substances do you think that contribute most to air pollution as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us
 does your work entitle anything of environmental along these lines
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 It's hav- well 
 I work in I work in environmentals projects right now
 And so the Sherman deal is lost a lot of hair over that project
 what we run into is we have the Texas Air Control Board T A C B that send out jurisdictions under which we have to reply to
 And a lot of their rules and regulation aren't real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the T A C B which is located in Austin in writing 
 and hey 
 look what we've done here at T I
 And we are presently in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to 
 this is our side a- allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage 
 It's in in in tons per year 
 and so w- w- you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems that scrub out the N O X and V O C's and and ammonia compounds like all the acids to a certain level 
 We are very aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions 
 So if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts 
 And so what we go through is if you see it smoking there's a problem 
 And having worked with some of the legal folks very closely it becomes a real issue especially when it's smoking 
 and you have to get it fixed el pronto
 As you know they they're allowed to come on site the federaldes anytime they want drive through and see and inspect
 So it's a full time everybody has their home phone number type of job 
 The Sherman facility we are still in the closer too but still have a little bit of finalization to do 
 Right 
 It's been pitched to the Sherman City Council with open arms as well as the public 
 We had open forum 
 and and Tom Jones our environmental corporate environmental guys handle the project
 And its real going real well 
 I think it's matter just a matter of fund funds right now as I understand it 
 but it's it's something else 
 Yeah 
 they're they're they're in the same issue 
 We were hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there 
 because the the system is setup where it won't have any emissions
 You're correct 
 It will have something coming out of the stackhouse it was it was human nature 
 But it won't have can any any bad stuff 
 So I think T I we spend of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost first thing we always look at 
 And we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the system of any other firm I know of 
 We eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here
 and it's an interesting job 
 But 
 Possibly
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'm familiar with that one
 We have we have stuff that's very interesting 
 we have hoods 
 we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where they have that we sample
 and it may have over a certain emission levels 
 this is on the solid side 
 and so we take it 
 and we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid 
 And we mix it with concrete and actually potash per se and concrete and then actually put it in the ground But not so not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab
 It was totally legal 
 But the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually show you what duckwork and things 
 And so we were very very cognizance of and aware of all these types of expenditures because it could get very expensive 
 But I think we you know we do all kinds of things to make the the world a better place to live you know 
 I think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that 
 I really would 
 I've enjoyed speaking with you
 This has been an interesting topic 
 I was one of the 
 I was responsible for all the planning and engineering over the corporate or in the north building 
 Yeah
 So I hope you like your office
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Glad to see y'all taken care of 
 Well the I think what changed everything and is y'all were y'all were the only ones that make any money for TI here in the last ten years Ju- 
 Exactly 
 And that's when when you start when you start paying your way you know Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys
 I was just 
 Exactly 
 I've enjoyed speaking with you
 See you later 
 Bye-bye
