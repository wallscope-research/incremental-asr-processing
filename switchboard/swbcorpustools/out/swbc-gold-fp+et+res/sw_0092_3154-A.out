 Okay 
 Well let's see 
 well we keep our paper paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and glass and plastics 
 and we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full 
 I guess we collect m- milk cartons and whatever p- other plastics are acceptable
 No 
 no 
 I didn't think that anybody had those at all yet
 Right 
 Well no 
 I haven't seen any 
 so I I thought that it all had all been delayed several times 
 So I have no idea what they look like 
 and I'm kind of anxious to see them
 right
 Right
 Right
 Oh
 of course 
 That they did 
 You know actually we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles 
 and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house
 You could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed 
 and so you just put the empty ones back out there 
 and he took them away and put you know put another gallon of glass glass bottle in there
 So yeah
 Right 
 right 
 it would be nice it would be nice to see it take a good turn here 
 It seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away 
 so I hope that this time it it stays 
 Just To see stacks and stacks of newspapers just to the trash is just amazing 
 So you know we when we go dump actually when we go dump our things we collect newspapers too and then take them 
 seems like there's a pretty well there's a p- pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics
 so that's kind of encouraging 
 I didn't know you know I didn't know if we started to do that 
 I didn't know what to expect
 Right
 Well I guess they will shortly 
 I 
 right
 Yeah 
 Right 
 Do you know I saw in Tom Thumb yesterday I saw the return to the the small Coke bottles
 And I don't know if there's a deposit on those or not
 They were glass they were the glass 
 well let's see 
 they'd be I don't know maybe ten ounce or six ounce or ten ounce Sort of a small size sort of a small size and and we anyway we just we didn't stop and look them look at them a long time 
 but and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down you know sort of sort of a basket type thing
 Right 
 right 
 so I hadn't seen that in a long time
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well 
 No 
 he doesn't like the paper sacks 
 and but he but you know he likes to pick the grass up too 
 He doesn't Doesn't 
 Right 
 right
 That's nice 
 I guess they dump it the same place 
 I wonder where they dump that
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well they must they must keep it separate if they have this date in
 They have this day now that it's you know separate from the other trash pick up
 No
