 Okay 
 we can start
 Hi
 I have four
 How many do you have
 Okay
 Okay
 Well no 
 because mine are all grown 
 So the topic for me 
 I I can only rera- relate now to my grandchildren
 I do keep my 
 I do take care of my youngest granddaughter most every Saturday 
 my daughter and her husband work Saturdays 
 My daughter is doing a schedule of twenty-four hours on the weekend 
 but she gets paid for forty
 And Dave is in supervisory work 
 and he has to work almost every Saturday 
 so 
 
 She's three
 Yes
 She's she's little 
 She's says how are you doing grandma today
 Whoa 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 No 
 she's my baby
 She's my baby 
 yeah
 She was a miracle baby
 Yeah 
 she really was
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yes 
 they do 
 uh-huh
 They really do 
 uh-huh
 Oh
 yeah 
 that's really 
 that's really wonderful
 Yeah
 Yeah
 that's marvelous
 Well they keep you hopping I'm sure
 Well I know that one of the ladies I know they are very involved with their little girl 
 and and I think it's excellent because she's getting qualified quality time for her musical talents her sports abilities
 and I think because she is the only child that they concentrate they would like to have more 
 but that hasn't been possible
 And she's tried many avenues
 and and so now it's just you know that she's kind of resolved herself that yes this is going to be the only one 
 And they're focusing on all of her welfare
 okay
 Uh-huh
 how wonderful
 That's wonderful
 Well that's wonderful
 they are
 No
 Yeah 
 you're 
 Now I think every- everything is doing doing doing out of the house Which can be very hectic
 Yeah 
 it wasn't so he- 
 Uh-huh
 You have to look on that on the positive side of that
 Yes 
 it is
 It's just a different lifestyle
 Yes
 
 My second grandson is in A Cappella
 and I know what you're talking about when he's involved you know the children are involved in that 
 and he's been 
 he has traveled 
 and they have won awards 
 so I 
 know *[[ slash unit or part of previous slash unit ]] Yes
 *[[slash problem should be ny]] Uh-huh 
 And I know where you're coming from
 and it's it's very nice
 I think those type of children that are involved in things like that their goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things
 Right
 Going to 
 Yeah
 A a a team effort 
 yes
 That That's wonderful 
 That's really is nice to have in your background that you know then you can you're you can be very flexible
 And there's less friction involved in relationships when you add that skill of teamwork
 And I mean a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that
 And I think it's a step a a giant step of progress I really do
 So I 
 The best of Well Cathy I think if you look to the Word of God and think on the things that are pure and lovely 
 and keep your mind off of negative things
 And keep your mind on positive things 
 and and stress that to your children
 And even if they're even if they're discouraged tell them that that's just a passing moment and to dwell on those things that are not negative and that are positive things in their life
 and I think you'll see a lot of growth in in their ability to control their thought pattern 
 and and when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God
 absolutely 
 That's right
 Uh-huh 
 <> Right
 Well if she looks if she looks at it as you suggest that that that's that she can give her h- her talent back to the Lord for His glory and she can look at it that way and and that's
