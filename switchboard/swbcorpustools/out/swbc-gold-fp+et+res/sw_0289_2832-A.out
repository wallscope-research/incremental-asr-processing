 Okay 
 sorry
 it's it looks like a little shot gun house almost 
 It's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other
 It's an older home 
 it's not new 
 I like it though 
 it's big
 I wouldn't know 
 I measured it one time because I was we had saw some termites 
 and we thought about getting it sprayed 
 I think it was like 
 I can't remember 
 I'm sorry 
 It's big enough for us though
 We kind of need maybe one more room 
 We've got two children
 Okay 
 we- 
 see that's north
 Okay 
 I live I live in Plano 
 so it's north to me 
 I say down 
 I'm really from Kentucky
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 okay 
 That area 
 that dialect 
 Uh-huh 
 That's what I want to do 
 How many kids do you have
 Do you have enough bedroom space then
 Uh-huh
 That's kind of like what we'd like to do 
 We just had a baby a couple months ago 
 and we've got a den 
 it's more or less a spare room
 We rarely go in there except for to play chess
 We want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter 
 and we need the one extra room 
 Like like you said our rooms are too s- the bedrooms are too small 
 the living room and kitchen are huge
 but the bedrooms are too small 
 Where you've got to leave the furniture just one certain way you can't rearrange it at all
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom
 No privacy
 Well we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house 
 It 
 I'd hate to clean these windows 
 I really would
 Ours are those too 
 yeah 
 You must live in an older home too then
 Uh-huh 
 Ours has too
 When we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it
 and he did it hisself 
 so most of that by now is falling apart
 You know well I mean it's not just horrible 
 but like this tiles come loose off the wall 
 the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile 
 and I don't like that at all
 With that the great big tiles square tiles like that you put on the floor the the huge one 
 Yeah 
 instead of wallpaper 
 I wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles 
 for that you put 
 right 
 that you put around a bathtub 
 that would be prettier
 But this looks like floor covering on the wall 
 It just doesn't look good
 Right 
 there's one big one that has come off 
 and short of putting nails through it we can't get it back on 
 so 
 And he rewired the house 
 and it's shorting out here and there 
 and 
 Uh-huh 
 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 We've got power surges on the west side of our house 
 We've got our stereo hooked up
 Well that 
 the power makes it run 
 It's never ran 
 it's always ran just fine the clock and stuff
 But it runs about ten minutes fast except for about a month for about a month the the clock ran normal
 And then the power went off again 
 lightning or something knocked it out 
 and we hooked it back up 
 and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again
 But on the east side of the house it runs fine
 He put new wiring in 
 it's all new wiring up in the attic or I guess crawl space
 but no 
 he didn't know what he was doing 
 he really should have hired people
 Right 
 he'll end up killing himself
 End up killing theirselves
 My husband he'll change out a light switch 
 but that's about as far as he'll go
 Yeah 
 was a what 
 Uh-huh 
 Well he put 
 which 
 I heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have three layers of shingles 
 Is it three or five 
 your husband probably knows
 Well he's got seven layers of shingles up there 
 and he told us it was a completely new roof 
 Like I said he didn't know what he was doing
 Uh-huh
 no
 And a house full of snow
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 no
 That 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 My neighbor or a friend of mine when I lived in Louisiana her 
 we all lived on base 
 my husband was in the Army
 She woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning water dripping from hers 
 The neighbor's la- washing machine had over done something 
 I don't know 
 but it was leaking just pouring water in 
 and it all went through to her roof 
 and it was coming out of the lights fixtures
 The fire alarm went off for some reason 
 It shorted it out or something
 So she woke up with about six feet of water in her house
 No 
 not six feet 
 but 
 Yeah 
 you might as well 
 so Did you have carpets and stuff
 Uh-huh 
 Your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 That's right
 Well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end
 Are you finished with it now
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 how long have you lived there
 You all did it yourselves
 The home improvements
 Uh-huh
