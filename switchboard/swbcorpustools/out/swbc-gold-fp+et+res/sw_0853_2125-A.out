 Okay 
 you want to start by telling me what camping is to you 
 Do you backpack or hike 
 or 
 No 
 I've never done a canoe trip 
 That sounds interesting
 man I imagine
 So they'll actually fit in the canoe 
 and then you go for days at a time
 God that sounds like fun 
 Well the camping I grew up with was like tents and Coleman stove type 
 And you know that just either out in the woods or 
 actually I I grew up water skiing 
 I was from California
 and so we would go up to the Sacramento river sloughs the delta there
 and you just pick a campground on the river 
 if it got you know over a hundred and ten degrees you went over the levee and jumped in the water You know 
 cooled off 
 but when I got married my husband had always backpacked
 And so we did that 
 I guess we haven't done it since my kids were born so about three years ago 
 And that was a new experience for me 
 but I enjoyed it 
 I like being able to go back into the mountains or you know where the trail didn't necessarily lead and where you couldn't necessarily pitch a tent 
 But that that was interesting 
 I I have always wanted to do some white water rafting 
 and so your canoeing kind of made me think of that
 Don't let that stop you 
 I know
 Yeah 
 so you haven't done that before
 My parents were sailing this last year down off Costa Rica 
 and they took about two weeks and went into 
 I don't even know the name of the river there 
 but they went white water rafting 
 and Mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience 
 She said it was truly incredible
 And you know I 
 there's that sense of it you know you're kind of scared that risk of like gosh what could happen and then the thrill of you know the excitement of doing it 
 so 
 Well do you have anything planned for this summer
 okay
 I imagine
 that doesn't that sounds good
 That sounds 
 We've been wanting to start camping again this year too 
 my oldest child is a girl was born three years ago three and a half
 And then I have a little one that just turned two 
 and we are in the process of potty training 
 I didn't want to go camping with diapers you know
 I 
 and and you know at a time when they're afraid of their shadow all they need is you know some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent 
 they'd be awake all night
 So but I think with him almost potty trained and you know she's not afraid of her shadow anymore that I'm I'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we'll be able to go this summer you know even if it's like over to Rio Dosa for a couple of days or something to get them used to it and get them started with little back packs of their own and you know things like that
 Uh-huh
 Well that's true
 Ugh I would need that before I could teach them
