 Okay 
 should begin
 *[[listen; could probably code if we could tell if it said "we" or "you"]] I can begin this 
 basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis
 and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good 
 I'm I'm pretty pleased with it 
 They cover just about everything vision dental medical
 you name it 
 and for me this is the first job I've had where they've covered that much 
 so I'm pretty satisfied myself
 what's your situation
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Are you a professor there
 I see 
 okay
 no doubt 
 Right 
 Well that's good
 Yeah 
 that's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell is 
 I used to work with the Army Research Institute 
 and being a a government organization you got quite a few holidays off
 But here you don't get that 
 You maybe get two or three a year
 So it's really 
 unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time
 So that's that's kind of a drawback I think 
 But I don't know 
 What do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I don't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night 
 they they basically reviewed Oregon's plan or The Oregon Plan toward nationalizing health care and that kind of thing 
 It's kind of an interesting plan 
 It's kind of cold though 
 They've essentially made up a list of all the different medical maladies that you can have and then basically made a cutoff 
 about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by by subsidized health care 
 and the ones above would
 So it's kind of like drawing this line 
 and and if you have it great 
 if you don't you're kind of out of luck
 but it was kind of an interesting show
 I think you're right 
 I think health care is probably the the most pressing the pressing one 
 but I'll tell you I I don't mind having dental you know 
 sometimes dental costs can be just about as expensive if not more 
 and I know historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical
 but I'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more 
 I'm not sure 
 how how does University of New Hampshire handle it
 
 Great
 Is that let me interrupt is that the same for both professors and and also staff and administration 
 is that generally across the board do you think 
 or 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 okay
 Right
 Yeah 
 I'm kind of interested because I'm actually that's the route I'd like to take when I finally get my degree is to is to teach in a university
 I'm a doctoral student in Florida right now
 but 
 yeah 
 that's that's interesting 
 That's one of the things I'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would they would cover and things like that
 is that right
