 Well first I think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to what they want to do
 once they have that then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer
 Yeah 
 a lot fields are 
 most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway
 It's it's your core education your general requi- general education requirements 
 if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree I don't I don't know what advice I'd give them 
 Go to the school you'd like to go to
 That's what I did 
 I didn't care about the program or anything else 
 I went where I wanted to go
 political science
 Where are you at
 Well yeah 
 I guess everybody's in Dallas that I talk to 
 I'm in North Carolina
 Yeah 
 right
 Sure
 yeah
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it does 
 I didn't know what I wanted to do after I got my my degree
 originally I had planned undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration 
 And I went ahead and pursued that 
 I I [ got + as far as the thesis and decided To hell with it 
 I didn't want it 
 and from that point I went to law school
 And after a year and a half of that I decided I didn't want that either 
 Haven't figured out what I want to be when I grow up
 And so but I I I really did enjoy the law 
 I mean that's that's where I wanted to be 
 but I didn't want to go through the the hassle that the law schools put you through because I never did want to be a practicing attorney 
 I just wanted a law degree
 And I've since discovered that I would be far better off being in the paralegal field Because that's the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what I like 
 and you don't have to put up with all the B S that the lawyers have to
 So that's that's what I'm pursuing right now
 and I'm pretty happy with it so far
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 that's probably very useful
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 good grief
 Yeah 
 I thought at one time I wanted to be a teacher 
 but I I quickly dispelled that idea when I became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet
 I said I couldn't do this everyday
 No way
 Maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing
 I am a dis- I am I am just a disgruntled person all around 
 I'm the I'm the original Mister Scrooge I guess
 Yeah 
 bah humbug 
 Yeah 
 I just 
 Probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school
 Well that remark in itself is a slam <> 
 My best friends are lawyers <>
 You know like like my best friends are blacks 
 Jewish 
 now blacks
 and I guess I I guess Iraqi now is the 
 Law law was a lot of fun until you get to law school
 and it doesn't become fun anymore
 Yeah 
 you going 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 if if if you've ever seen the program PAPER CHASE it's very much like that except worse
 It is
 Yeah 
 very much so
 Yeah 
 it's it's a lot of that 
 it it was enjoyable for a while 
 but it's such a grind
 and you begin to wonder you know
 if if I'm not I mean 
 you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer to do it
 If you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it
 I mean I wasted a year and a half of awfully hard 
 and I aged ten years
 But I I I wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world 
 It never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law
 What branch were you in
 What branch were you in
 I was too
 Well I got I got tired of the service after a while I mean 
 it 
 I had a terrific job really enjoyed it
 command post
 I was just wondering were you in SAC by any chance 
 Were you in SAC
 SAC
 okay 
 I I thought maybe you might have had some experience with the R C one thirty-fives
 
 Well
 Well
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's right 
 and it And if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it
 Uh-huh 
 sure
 That's true 
 I found that out when I was in high school 
 I worked at McDonald's
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I was the same way too 
 I'm not a people person 
 I I I hate having to play such a nice guy You know especially when it's all phony Especially when you got some jerk coming in
 I 
 it's just not for me 
 I'm I deal much better in research and books and stuff like that which is why I'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot
