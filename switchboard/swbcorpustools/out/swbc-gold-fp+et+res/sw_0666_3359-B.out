 Well I I try to be as well
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 you're in New York 
 I was going to 
 there's a place if you ever make it to Dallas they have the best prime rib 
 It's called Lawry's like Lawry's seasoning salt
 and it is absolutely wonderful
 And we were there a few months ago 
 and it I mean it's kind of pricey 
 well from New York it probably doesn't matter 
 but 
 is it okay
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well I think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen 
 and it includes you know salad and rolls and some other stuff 
 but it is absolutely wonderful 
 It's the best I have ever had
 Yeah 
 Well 
 Yeah 
 well we like lots of people down here like Mexican food
 so that's 
 I I think Italian and Mexican food are probably my favorites
 But I'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff
 Uh-huh
 okay
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 fresh seafood down there
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 seafood seems to be a lit- a little bit more expensive than than other types of food
 But it sure is good 
 and it's supposed to be good for you
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Do you like spicy foods 
 or 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well we we like spicy food down here especially the hot sauce Picante sauce or salsa whatever you all call it
 and we we sure go through a lot of that 
 But I like it hot 
 but I don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running 
 Yeah
