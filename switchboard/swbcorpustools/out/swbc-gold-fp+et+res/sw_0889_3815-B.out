 well yeah 
 I am as a matter of fact 
 Well act- actually I'm looking for another car 
 but new 
 probably not 
 sports car
 usually either black or red
 And electric windows and power locks 
 Now 
 Well not so much that as it is 
 I've had so many times when you know I'll have a friend next to me or I see somebody guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window
 It is just a real pain 
 or you know if I'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and somebody that I know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive reach over and try to roll down the window
 And so power locks power windows are just just things that just really help a lot 
 What about you
 Oh
 Sure
 Have you ever had a car with an air bag
 No
 Well it it see- sure seems to save lives 
 and 
 yeah 
 I actually I like the anti-lock brakes
 And I have never had a chance to 
 I have been in cars that have had them 
 but I've never tromped on the brakes to see you know on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up
 But you think you'd buy an American car or a European or Japanese
 What was that
 Huh 
 stick shift 
 huh
 Did it have what a three speed or a four speed
 Wow
 Well actually I much prefer a stick shift 
 and what I'm I'm curious 
 I I know why I love a stick shift 
 Why d- why did you want one
 Uh-huh
 It's hard to find stick shift cars anymore
 Huh 
 yeah
 No 
 I mean most of the sports cars are stick shift
 Huh
 Huh
 I guess I I grew up on it and it's fun 
 It's it's an enjoyable part of driving 
 I do feel like I have more control over the car 
 and it it to me it gives me more a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions
 it i- it does 
 I don't know 
 it it's really more fun than anything 
 else As long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic it's fun 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 of course I like gadgets and and fun things on the cars which are all the things course the c-
