 So who's your favorite team
 The Dallas Cowgirls 
 Well they did have a fairly decent year finally this year
 At least they're coming around
 Well I mean you know I think once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established they'll do all right
 Uh-huh
 I'm a Viking fan
 And they haven't been doing too hot 
 so 
 No 
 in fact in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal
 I've never been over impressed with him
 Well who's the running 
 is it Sammy Smith 
 or is it Emmett Smith
 Emmett Smith
 Yeah
 I'm not sure
 Who else is 
 there's you know Mike 
 Minnesota Vikings used to be the general manager starting the World Football League
 So and th- and he was trying to keep 
 <> I can't even think of the guy's name either the coach of the Vikings
 Bu- 
 Jerry Burns
 Goin- ke- he was going to keep him as the coach somehow 
 but I don't know 
 I'd like to see the Vikings get revamped somehow
 Well they started out really bad 
 they went like one and six 
 and then they won five or six in a row
 So they were in a shot to make the play-offs 
 and they screwed up the last couple of games
 Yeah 
 I guess you can
 Yeah
 And the Cardinals were kind of like the Cowb- 
 in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys 
 and the Cowboy Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season 
 and the Cardinals got killed by the Cowboys 
 so 
 don't made any excuses for him 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I don't know 
 Yeah 
 I think it was 
 But well I got my thirty day notice yesterday
 I'm done where I work
 So anyway I guess we can't talk much more about that 
 but I just thought I'd throw that in there 
 w- 
 I've always ran out of time ever since I've done this
 They always say you've talked your ten minute limit
 Make sure we get our cash flow
 actually when I was younger I was a Cardinal fan too
 Remember Jim Hart 
 Jim Hart was playing 
 Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals 
 This was a long time ago
 <> I don't know who else I've ever 
 That's about it 
 I was always a Viking fan 
 I think I was into the Cardinals for a little bit 
 and 
 Yes 
 of course
 Yeah 
 well the Cowboys were th- America's football team
 there's no question about that 
 so 
 Again
 What are they going up to thirty bucks or something
 So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year
 That's interesting 
 I almost lost our electricity here
