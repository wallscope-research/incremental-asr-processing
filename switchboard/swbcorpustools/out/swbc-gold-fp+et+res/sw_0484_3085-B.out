 Okay 
 I 
 my children as a matter of fact are all grown now 
 So I am assisting them with their children in their selections 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I myself really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in today's environment than the one on one care is 
 when my children were growing up I actually had them up and until they were in the preschool situation I had them in a in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids 
 and I felt like that home environment was very important to them
 It was important to me
 and I feel like that they they had that one on one that's so necessary at that age
 However in today's environment it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups simply because that's the way our young people are are dealt with
 They're dealt with in packages 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Absolutely
 absolutely
 without a doubt
 Uh-huh
 I recently stopped by McDonalds 
 and I was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children 
 and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center 
 and of course she was she had just gotten her degree 
 and she was so enthusiastic 
 and she was excited about it 
 and she was going to accomplish all of these things
 however when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time the pay is minimal
 and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really don't want to make a living for themselves in order to be in that environment
 Absolutely
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well they ask so much of those caretakers for the amount that that they pay
 They are to be there ahead of time you know 
 they're there early to receive the kids
 That's right
 And then then they have to work until the shop until the place closes at six P M 
 and then it's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because they don't have cleaning crews in most of those
 And she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary
 and she 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Well I know that when my youngsters were small 
 now my older son was adopted 
 so he went into child care at two weeks
 and my younger son went into child care at six weeks
 So they were in that environment actually up until they became seven and nine
 And at that point I said Look they have been given the custodial care that they need 
 and the after hours care has been as good a quality as I can provide for them 
 However they're going out into the school environment now 
 they're under a lot of other influences 
 I need to be here for them 
 I need to be involved in their school because I want to be the one who influences the way they develop 
 So I quit working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that I could help direct their their learning experiences and their development
 I I felt like that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them and hold them
 But when time came to direct their ability to make choices to develop the kinds of things that that they're going to need to interact with other people I felt like I needed some strong influence there
 So I di- 
 I know
 That's right 
 once they get up in sch- 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well I just felt very strongly about that 
 and I I did not work as a matter of fact 
 my son was in the second grade 
 and when he started at Skyline High School I asked him Son when you know where do I go to sign up for the P T A 
 And he said Mom don't do that to me
 please don't do that to me 
 So I knew it was time to go back to work
 But I feel very good about spending those years with my boys
 and I was just really grateful I only had one bad child care experience 
 It was in a home 
 the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it 
 She was from Argentina
 and she was going back home 
 and I couldn't just you know wait for eight three or four months and then bring them back to her
 so I had to find a new place
 and I put them in this home 
 the kids cried when I took them 
 the kids cried wh- I could hear the kids crying when I went to pick them up
 they were always cranky and irritable
 so I just took off and went there one day 
 and the children were left unattended in a room you know 
 they they were not well cared for
 and so it didn't take me long to take them out of that place
 but that's the only bad experience I had 
 the rest of the time they stayed in La Petite Academy
 and I was very pleased with their development and their progress
 They learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they didn't learn 
 but they're going to learn it sometime 
 so but for the most part they did have good care 
 and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them 
 and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the Y and taught to swim which just pleased me to death because I've always been ha- you know been afraid of the water
 however my older son came home 
 and he said Mom I don't like that man 
 said he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water and told me I had to get my face wet or I'd never swim
 boy 
 it didn't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school and relay that to them 
 and she said Well she said you know kids do exaggerate 
 but she said let's go ahead and send him another day or two days 
 and I promise you faithfully I will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly what's happening
