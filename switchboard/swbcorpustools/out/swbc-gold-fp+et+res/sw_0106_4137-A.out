 Let's see 
 mine's pretty easy actually 
 I just got done reading a a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the new Saturns
 and although I can't afford it right now I would just like love to have one
 Well 
 No 
 regardless of that fact 
 It's the best car in the class for the be- cheapest amount of money 
 I'm interested in having it for doing a little autocross racing closed circuit racing
 and it seems to just blow the com- compe- competition away
 Handling power everything 
 Yeah 
 it just got like the top rating 
 It was compared up against 
 let's see 
 there was like the Mazda M X three Nissan's whatever their two N X two thousand the Civic S I 
 and it just you know it it dominated over all of them 
 Everybody all the raters loved it 
 I like the I like the styling 
 and I seen a few of them actually race 
 and they seem to be really good cars for it
 Mustang G Ts 
 can't afford it
 Right 
 yeah 
 I'm a graduate student 
 and let's face it 
 I don't make any money 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we'll see then 
 Yeah 
 right now I'm stuck 
 I I've got a a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that 
 it's fast but unreliable 
 and trying to get it prepared for racing 
 But it's it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the g- Saturn 
 yeah 
 I'd do it I'd use it for both 
 The nice thing about autocrossing is you can you can do both
 just like a set up a lot of times 
 and it's like really large parking lots And pylons and things
 Tight turns hard acceleration 
 I've seen a lot of Mustangs compete 
 and it's interesting 
 They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class
 Yeah
 what are you thinking about buying
 The Legend
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well I was I was actually in 
 a lot of the B M Ws are produced in sh- Stutgardt and and Munich
 and I was I was there this summer 
 and i- I was really impressed by the the factory tours and such for B M W
 Yeah
 
 of course 
 of course they are 
 They want you to buy their car 
 Yeah 
 there 
 it was it was interesting 
 I was at I I also went to the Porsche 
 and it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed
 Yeah 
 the the B M W is really like we have all these like high tech things 
 and everything is put together with exacting tolerances 
 and and then you go to Porsche 
 and it's like well these cars are completely handmade
 and no two of them are alike 
 And 
 so it's like completely opposed 
 I don't know 
 which do I like better 
 I think I like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical
 Unless it's it's a toy
 Let's face it
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 but it it B M Ws good for that 
 What kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it use it for
 Wow yeah
 That's cool
 Yeah 
 that's good 
 I also I was impressed by by the Mercedes too
 I really I really like the Mercedes
 The factory was nice 
 and 
 And is it different for the for the B M W
 Probably
 Right 
 I can imagine that
