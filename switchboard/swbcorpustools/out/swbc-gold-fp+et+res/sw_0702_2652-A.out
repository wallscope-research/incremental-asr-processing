 Okay 
 Guess we can go ahead 
 well I guess you know it's you know 
 since living in Dallas it's always so hot so in the summertime I just I wear lots of shorts so because I don't work during the day
 So do you work
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and buying suits and stuff yeah because just being at home 
 and I work at home 
 so I just have you know I just wear my you know my shorts and stuff like that 
 I don't go out and spend lots of money on different you know suits and stuff you know
 But when I 
 before I got married you know I was working 
 so I you know I had more suits and stuff then 
 but 
 Worry about all that kind of stuff 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 When you're training right 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 moved from Winter 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 because I came from Wyoming 
 and I had wool suits and wool skirts 
 and You know I've got all these clothes that I never wear because you can't wear them here
 And the seasons are just so much different 
 You have so much summer
 And so then when I you know I finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 You hate to get rid of it because you know how much you spent on them
 And it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff I know
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Clothes 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and I I just don't spend you know 
 right now my clothes come from Target you know 
 Yes 
 and they 
 you take them out of the drier 
 and they're wadded up in a ball
 Oh 
 I'm so glad to meet somebody that that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house
 You know I have very little furniture
 but my ironing board is part of my decor 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 well yeah 
 it is it is 
 but it's like I just don't want to do it <>
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that's an idea
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I you know 
 if I have 
 if I know I'm having somebody come over to the house and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room I will put it away
 but I iron our clothes as we go along
 so you know 
 Right 
 no 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 You can't iron it all 
 and 
 Yeah 
 And then with my kids they're always getting into you know 
 they can't decide what they want to wear so they change their minds you know I know I mean my oldest is only four 
 but she's still changes her mind two or three times before she figures out what she's going to wear 
 so 
 And then they never put anything back
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that that that's called smart you know they don't we don't do that kind of stuff you know *[[ Seems this should end in a slash ]] That's called too easy on mom
 *[[ See note above; this would seem to be an indep slash unit ]] Our lot in life is to make her life miserable 
 so 
 
 Yeah 
 well that's 
 it's been good talking to you to see somebody hear somebody that does the same thing I do because I tell people what I do 
 and they just go how do you do that
 It's like it's easy you just do it you know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I don't think I'd know what to do if it wasn't there you know
 My husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes
 You know
 Yeah 
 He wouldn't know where to put things 
 so 
 Yeah 
 so 
 it was nice talking with you too
 Take care 
 Bye-bye
