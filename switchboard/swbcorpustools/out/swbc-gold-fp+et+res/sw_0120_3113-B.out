 Okay
 Right
 Right 
 I agree too 
 I don't think the jury should be the ones that that put the sense- sentencings down 
 I think the judges should 
 or even a panel of of lawyers if if it got to that point Might be better at than just regular civil people Not knowing you know exactly what things are from from murder on up to like tax stuff you know
 Right
 Yeah 
 and 
 Right 
 that's 
 yeah 
 And and most people that do sit on juries 
 some people just sit on them once in their lifetime you know if they're that lucky sometimes Or you know what whatever the case may be And and may not have any idea of what what the standard punishment would be for it
 And it they may have some different idea 
 I mean it might be more important for them to put a sen- sen- sentencing down that was longer you know that didn't fit the punishment didn't fit the crime Or not long enough or you know whatever the case may be
 I I think the judges do have that that better knowledge of it 
 The only thing I worry about sometimes is if if you get somebody in there that that has a name that is the defendant and you know sometimes might have more pull which that does happen
 I mean we can't say it doesn't because it does happen 
 I mean not everybody is you know has has the right morals sometimes 
 People can be paid off or politically or whatever the case may be 
 and sometimes that's not real fair either though 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Right 
 Well well also what I don't think is fair either is when you have like a say a rapist come in 
 and and his attorney gets his sentences sentencing reduced because he's gone to a lesser charge like I don't know what assault or something or 
 But which that doesn't make any sense to me either 
 I know it's hard to prove rape and whatnot 
 and and and the person that was raped or whatever doesn't 
 I mean it's embarrassing and all this other stuff 
 and they they're put on like they were the ones that caused it or whatever 
 but to me when you do the crime then you should pay for whatever you did 
 and and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge 
 I don't I don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say well you know that was a breeze 
 I can go out and do it again and you know have the same thing happen 
 That's that's not right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 And to me how can you how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of whether it be whether it pertains to the case or not 
 somebody thinks it it had because they've got it there
 So the lawyers the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information
 Don't they
 They only put part of it
 Yeah
 Right 
 Well that's just like that old witness game 
 well it's a game kids play too 
 but somebody did it just for your train of thought where they they showed something 
 and they asked 
 they there were like four people
