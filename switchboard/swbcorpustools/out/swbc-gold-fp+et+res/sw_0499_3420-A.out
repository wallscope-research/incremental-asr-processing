 Hello 
 my name is Donna 
 and I'm calling from Plano Texas
 okay 
 would you like me to go first
 Okay 
 I have three children two two who are in regular school eleven year old an eight year old 
 and then my little one three year old is in a University of Gymnastics 
 it's a a preschool
 and I think it was really hard to to pick the right day care or preschool or Mother's Day Out 
 I guess you can classify them all together
 some of the qualifications that I look for was that you know the cost and exactly what they did if it was structured or nonstructured if they had a little academic in there and you know you know what the qualifications of the teachers' were and if the place was clean and the hours 
 and just just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff 
 congratulations
 Right
 Or staying home 
 Uh-huh
 That's a very good place to start I think
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 the Mother's Day Out programs 
 and that's where Shannon had started in a Mother's Day Out program
 and the churches always have I think a a pretty good program 
 and you have to make sure that you that you apply pretty early because they do have a lot of places have very long waiting lists
 And and another question to ask is if they're state certified you know if the teachers have their Master's degree in in child education and child development 
 you know what what kind of a structure is it going to be 
 when your child's a little bit older like a three year old you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap 
 Is there like a mandatory nap time
 What they do at Shannon's school is have a video tape going 
 and if and they lay on these little mats 
 and if they fall asleep they kind of let them sleep 
 and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones 
 and the other ones get up and go do something else
 So she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there you know which is which is nice 
 That's true
 Right 
 And sometimes when the child's a lot younger before they're really before three years old you know like the church is a good program 
 and sometimes you even consider you know having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or or something like that 
 and another consideration is how many infants or children are they what's the ratio of of teachers [ to + to children
 because that makes a a a difference 
 and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day 
 just your child and or do they just put any child in any crib you know 
 you would want maybe your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed you know 
 I'm sure that whatever you decide you'll be happy with
 And it's exciting time to have a new one 
 I bet 
 That's that's wonderful
 Uh-huh
 Asking
 Right
 Some some places start them as early as I think well some some places take them as infants I guess you know like eight weeks even
 there's a place to look into 
 a friend of mine who's a nurse is was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place in on Fifteenth Street 
 up 
 it's in Plano somewhere where 
 nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants infants and then only up to like two years old
 and it's it's supposed to be really a a 
 you know some places just specialize in just real little ones
 and then other ones are the older children
 But it is a difficult situation I think 
 When they're when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry
