 Okay
 What's your view
 What's your view
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 You know even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place you know
 I don't know 
 Coming from Texas you're probably 
 I don't know 
 I shouldn't make stereo types 
 but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think
 you're just live down there
 Yeah
 well 
 Yeah 
 well I know how you feel 
 I'm I grew up in Nebraska 
 and and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know 
 and man there's no way There's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons 
 That's just 
 I don't know
 Yeah
 It doesn't sit with me very well 
 I don't know I anymore 
 I keep a thirty-eight in my truck you know
 Yeah 
 I just about all 
 well I live in Minneapolis 
 and I 
 well actually I live in Florida 
 but I am staying in Minneapolis for a year 
 and you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now
 and it's just you never know who is out there
 You know it's just for self protection purposes 
 and then of course there's the hunting issue 
 so 
 yeah 
 that's good 
 What do you do Jeff
 yeah
 All right
 Yeah
 I'm researcher of Honeywell up here
 So 
 yeah 
 You guys do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything 
 or 
 Yeah 
 You know that's something I miss quite a bit
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 All right 
 Yeah 
 my brother was a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and really enjoyed it quite a bit 
 but I don't know 
 I guess that what the scale now is it's zero for for a complete 
 That's right
 I guess I am about eight or nine 
 Yeah 
 no doubt about it 
 but 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 if there's if there's a way you know to limited it to people that I don't know that 
 they I guess they passed a couple of laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go to buy a hand gun 
 and then they actually 
 I know it's this way in Florida 
 They have a waiting period where you buy one 
 and that's a week
 and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that 
 I think that's a pretty good idea 
 and that's 
 I don't know 
 that's not a bad idea 
 but then again you can always get around that 
 You could go through the black market like you say 
 You know you always be able to get around 
 but 
 Yeah 
 it's one of things 
 but I don't know 
 I guess I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon
 Yeah 
 I'm just not 
 I think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway
 There 
 It kind of takes the sport out of hunting 
 You know it's like what can you do with that that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve
 You know you might do the same thing
 And so it's like I don't know It does 
 It takes the sport out of it 
 For me I would much rather have a bow anytime 
 I I like bows 
 You know I have done some bow hunting 
 and I I get into it 
 and I think it's more of a challenge you know
 But I don't know 
 I guess it keeps the shell makers in business
 But I don't know 
 Anyway that's about where I stand 
 You 
 And you have you eaten yet or whatever
 Is it seven o'clock there
 You guys central
 it's not too good 
 It's kind of rainy actually
 Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about I don't know ten or twenty degrees
 and it's been up around forty 
 So people are people are whining about the rain and stuff but not too bad about the temperature 
 Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that 
 so 
 I am just up here for the year 
 and it's kind of shocking
