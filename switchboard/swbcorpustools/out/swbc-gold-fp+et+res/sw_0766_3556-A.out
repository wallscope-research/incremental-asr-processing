 Okay 
 Jerry the topic was favorite T V shows and what kind are you interested in and how they and do they differ from like mine
 Right
 do you 
 yeah
 I'm sort of a well 
 I'm different from that 
 I'm sort of a a movie buff
 I go to a couple of mov- movies a week sometimes 
 but honestly I'm I'm self-employed 
 and a lot of times I will go out and take a lunch hour go to lunch from like twelve to two go to a movie and just come back to my office
 But I do it 
 it's like entertainment 
 and I'm pretty much of a a junk movie watcher by myself
 If I take my wife then we see something a little nicer you know
 But 
 and my kids are all sort of movie watchers 
 You know we we've always been to a lot of we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life 
 So but I would just as soon be doing something else 
 it's just that my kids are gone now 
 and and my wife's a school teacher 
 and sometimes and she doesn't get home until about seven o'clock 
 So you know I'll come in like five thirty or six 
 and I'll turn on the tube set there and have my coffee or Coke or whatever and a little T V 
 and sometimes I set there all evening
 You bet 
 you bet
 Well that's an interesting channel
 That's great
 You know I've I've just never spent any time watching it 
 and you know I like my sports and everything 
 but I 
 Watch my Dallas Cowboys 
 I watched them to halftime before I left 
 and I left at halftime
 and started dri- driving 
 They sure did 
 They just did an excellent job
 Yeah 
 the Eagles 
 yeah 
 luck into it now I think 
 Cowboys they earned it on their own merit 
 Well 
 You bet 
 as much as everyone you know used the word love Tom Landry I'm glad that Jimmy Johnson's there
 It was
 I think so too
 He wanted to go out a winner though 
 I think he would have stayed there four or five more years until he could have gone out 
 no 
 it's you know he earned his stripes
 I know
 yeah
 Yeah 
 he's a he's a winner in anyone's book
 and I hope he's a winner in his own book you know because that's the key there
 You bet
 Little things that disturb me 
 and I know he's being a little hardnosed about it 
 but you know this ring of honor thing you know he needs to be there because he's earned it 
 He deserves it 
 and he was the Dallas Cowboys 
 and he won't do that yet 
 So I hope he makes up his mind to do it because he needs to be remembered
 No 
 no 
 no
 Absolutely not 
 That's true 
 but he needs to be honored 
 let's put it that way
 You bet 
 I've been here since seventy-four 
 and I feel like a native
 did you
 Yeah
 We came we came down from New York state in seventy-four and never had any regrets at all
 You bet 
 It's been
 It's a great place to raise our kids 
 and I've got my last kid graduating from college this next December
 she's getting married the month before in November 
 so 
 I will have finished be finished with that
 Right
 Well good
 No 
 not at all
 Well I enjoy my T V programs 
 I like those 
 I like those detective programs 
 I like everything 
 I can watch Bill Cosby because I think he has a great show
