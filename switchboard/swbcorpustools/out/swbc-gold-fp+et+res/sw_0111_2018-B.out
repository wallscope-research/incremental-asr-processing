 Hello
 Hi
 Hi 
 hi 
 this is Lisa
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I got a call yesterday too 
 This is a different subject though
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It's kind of an easy thing to talk about
 Yeah 
 I think you have to push one 
 and then we can start recording it
 Okay
 Yes
 Yes 
 I know because I know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her I guess 
 she's in her late forties 
 You were expected to stay home and take care of the kids 
 and I've never faced that at all
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 uh-huh 
 I think it's definitely gotten better
 Uh-huh
 Because women are in every field now 
 I mean I can't think of a field that they're not involved in
 And I know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field
 I don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing
 Yeah
 Hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue 
 I mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman
 I think that would be the best goal
 Uh-huh 
 exactly 
 not what color you are how old you are what your male or female 
 That would be wonderful 
 I guess it's kind of an ideal world though 
 Yeah
 Exactly 
 or the way you look 
 or the way you you know 
 your age or anything 
 I think that would be a wonderful way to do it
 Uh-huh 
 and then 
 Uh-huh 
 also with women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what's it called job sharing
 Like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or 
 Is it
 That would be great
 Or a lot of women I know now and my one of my supervisors when she went on L O A to have her baby we hooked up a terminal at her house 
 and she you know we could send her messages 
 and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house 
 I would just take her the actual paperwork once every week or two 
 and that worked out great too
 And that's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it
 All it was was you know 
 I mean she just used a phone modem 
 and she was like she was sitting in the office 
 so I think that's real nice too to come up with different options 
 Do you like the job sharing
 Do you
 Do you work like half days or half weeks or 
 that's great
 Uh-huh 
 Do you get the full benefits
 that's wonderful
 Yeah 
 especially with children and so many things going on that would be great
 Either way 
 yeah 
 you have your career and your home life 
 and that would be a nice way especially if you have young children
 Uh-huh 
 no 
 I think 
 yeah 
 My son's just in day-care 
 but even that they have extracurricular activities 
 and the older they get the more that you're involved in that
 Yeah
 I do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making 
 you know when that subject comes up they can say yes 
 that would be wonderful
 Plus I bet it cuts cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything 
 so you don't have to you know unless you're just really sick or the child's sick
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I have to plan way in advance because 
 or what I've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours
 That's been real helpful too 
 like my doctor stays open til nine in the evening 
 So that's real helpful 
 so you don't you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour
 I don't know how many times I've done that to do something post office or the bank or any kind of errand 
 so 
 Uh-huh 
 I guess I take it for granted kind of because I just 
 it's always been that way
 But I know 
 no 
 I can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of was sick 
 and I know she probably didn't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did
 I think there is still some discrimination there where as you know men and women work in the same job 
 I think men get paid more
 but I think that's improving 
 It's such a slow process 
 it's frustrating 
 but you can see that it's wrong 
 and you just want to make it right 
 but at least the wheels are moving forward
 Yeah 
 I think it's getting better not worse 
 Well I should probably get back to my job 
 Call again
 Okay 
 bye-bye
