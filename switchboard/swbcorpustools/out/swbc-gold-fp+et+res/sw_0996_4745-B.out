 I agree 
 Yeah
 I know that I have three children
 And I stay home 
 I don't work
 And I know that it it must be really challenging to try to juggle a job and and also your children 
 Because I know my husband if I were gone as much as he is we wouldn't have the influence on them that I would want to put on them
 And I also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to daycare every day they don't like to be around adults
 They don't want to play around adults 
 They don't want to be around you 
 They don't want you to tell them what to do 
 They want to do their own thing
 And they're the very same age as my children
 And I'm finding as I volunteer up at the school I just being 
 I'm not educated at all in really detecting this 
 but I can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty good basis after I've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to daycare and which kids stay home
 And you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults that the ones that are are home and the ones even that are at home that are getting the love and attention that they need
 Not that the kids that go out aren't getting that 
 it's just a different 
 they're they are more use to being with their own age kids
 they're not use to being with adults and to responding to adults
 I think the trend in the United States 
 I feel really bad that it's turned so much to where the children are 
 Right 
 Right 
 It's hard 
 It really is hard 
 I know that my husband and I have to do a lot of sacrificing to keep me home
 And 
 Right
 Right 
 I think one of the things that people look at too though is spen- how they spend their time with their children
 I think with working moms if you can get them ma- the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year-round school where you work
