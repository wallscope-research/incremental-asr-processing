 Jimmy so how do you get most of your news
 wow 
 So when you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when
 okay 
 Well I would probably be a junkie or s- watch C N N a lot 
 but I don't I don't subscribe to cable be- because of the poor service and also because 
 well I I give to the United Way 
 and so I figured that amount of money I just donate to that
 Yeah 
 I take away a addiction 
 something
 Well I 
 
 What what newspapers do you read
 Uh-huh 
 For a while there I I I subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES a- actually a couple of newspapers because you know my fiance 
 well she was unemployed for a while 
 so she you know really needed to look at the the want- help wanted ads
 and so often they they tr- the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of newspape- news

 Look at the the Smith trial
 I mean that was a joke
 yeah 
 the N P R doing that 
 yeah 
 I know 
 I had some visitor 
 and he was just in- just I don't know fixated on that you know just listened to it constantly 
 and I guess that's good when it's live if you if you'll really want that
 but that's not really providing you news
 It's it's more like a media event rather than reporting
 really 
 That's kind of boring to me I think
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I guess that's true
