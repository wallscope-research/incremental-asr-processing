 Uh-huh
 Well my parents are both in their seventies 
 My my mother and stepfather and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies 
 And my father and stepmother are not in very good health 
 So this is something that is 
 Yes 
 it is
 Yes 
 they are
 They are
 Not for them my my mother and stepfather have have set up an arrangement where they have a large home and two of my sisters and and their families one of them's husband and then all the children are living in this home 
 Its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms 
 and and they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen 
 And and my father bought this my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care 
 and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home
 Unless unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home
 Well I I felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also 
 I I read a lot 
 and then I know people th- then have visited nursing homes and have had great grandparents in the nursing homes 
 and it was not a happy situation for for any of them 
 And and we have a very active nursing home here in Plano that that has activities going all the time 
 and they have 
 even the people that are wheelchair bound and and really are are ti- ti- incapacitated Go and participate in olympics 
 and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here 
 You know th- so there are a lot of a lot of activities going on all the time 
 and this is a nursing home 
 it's not a senior citizens home 
 So that the people are really 
 Right 
 They need the nursing care 
 and and but it's a very expensive solution
 Right
 Right
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 And that's right I well I took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation 
 and they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had had apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating
 And he had apparently had not been in the home too long just a week or so 
 but when they the family came in to see him they had not been made aware 
 I was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance 
 and I overheard their conversation 
 And when the family walked in his wife and daughter and son-in-law they were not even aware of what had happened
 So I told them he strangled on some chicken 
 and they said the the woman the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or so you know 
 and I thought 
 Right 
 Right
 And then she was upset 
 he had on two different shoes one of which was not even his 
 He had on a pair of slacks 
 and the wife said "these are not his slacks" 
 and she said "I just took two pair over yesterday for him that were clean" 
 And 
 Right
 Right 
 Well I this was just something that I was I witnessed to
 And and at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in 
 And we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour 
 And with just a curtain of course between us and and 
 th- they re- revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth 
 and he was definitely 
 just by looking at him and the way he acted you could tell he was in need of of nursing home care 
 but the family were all talking about putting him in another home 
 They said he will not go back to that one
 I'm glad they the option 
 I I would hate to be in a position where that was all I could afford 
 and there were not there was no choice
 my 
 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Right 
 That's right
 Visits everyday 
 Right
 Visit 
 right
 Right
 Suspicious
 {D You know I I my I remember my my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died 
 and I guess there was not a name for what she had at that time 
 but I guess Alzheimer's would come as close as anything 
 she really was not aware of what she was doing
 And I ca- I can remember she had several strokes 
 and the nursing home was right next to a hospital 
 and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days 
 And it was she was it was just like keeping something
