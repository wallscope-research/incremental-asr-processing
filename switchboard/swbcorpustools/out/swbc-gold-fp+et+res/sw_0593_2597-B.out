 Well this is a good subject isn't it
 It's it's something that you can really talk about
 I don't know what we're going to do about it 
 but but it's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about 
 you know when they say the Middle East it's such a big area 
 and there's so many different problems there 
 what do you want to concentrate on
 Well I'll tell you something 
 I I have a sister-in-law from Israel
 and and they're really quite arrogant about it all 
 They they believe that they they belong there 
 and they've belonged there forever 
 and the Palestinians and the Arabs are more or less 
 they they consider them second class
 So they're really quite arrogant about it 
 I don't I don't know if that contributes to the problem
 I'm I'm sure this is the one time that the Israelis are really happy to have their big brothers the Americans
 but I didn't really talk about that with her 
 She my sister-in-law now lives in Switzerland
 But when they were living in Israel it was it was the the Palestinians they they come in an 
 and they're they're nothing but really servants for them 
 and they really treat them like second class citizens 
 They they don't really want them around 
 but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such
 But they they really do 
 they look down on them 
 And I don't know being 
 I I live in Vermont 
 and being up here we pretty much treat everybody you know as someone that has merit even if they're poor or if they're Hispanic or if they're black 
 We give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and all the hurt in the big cities you know
 I- if I lived in Washington D C I think I'd have a different attitude about Black people 
 because I've heard that it it the they're terrible you know 
 it's just like it's a dog eat dog world 
 And here you know all all my black friends are professionals 
 and they're they don't you know they don't go out and abuse drugs 
 and they they send their kids to school 
 and they they they you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff
 So it's just a different world
 I talked to someone about San Antonio
 and they said that they they have you have quite the problem with the ghettos 
 I don't know 
 do they call it the barrio down there
 Yeah 
 but I heard that sa- San Antonio unlike like like a city like San Diego it se- it just has a really bad problem
 Yeah 
 like say Houston 
 Now I would now me not even knowing anything about Houston I would think that it's a pretty calm city
 No 
 there's a lot of crime
 my 
 yeah 
 like I wer- we're so protected up here 
 it's it's really strange 
 I mean our red light district I mean you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life you know
 and we're just so protected 
 But it's it's over in the Mid East especially Israel it's just like Israelis have a like a totalitarian system when it comes to the Palestinians 
 You know the Israelis can do anything they want 
 but when it comes to Palestinians if they're out in the street at night it's it's really looked on as odd 
 usually they're they're bussed in to the the Jewish neighborhoods and the Jewish cities 
 and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories
 So they don't have that 
 But what do you think about the mess that's we've created in Iraq
 It's just what do you do for them 
 you want to do something for them 
 but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the the country
 To do it 
 yeah 
 but you see President Bush is telling them rebel you know uprise 
 And that's what they did 
 and now they're like asking him for help 
 and he's like no we can't get involved 
 What my husband had very strong feelings 
 he agreed with the General Schwartzkopf 
 he said he should have let Bush should have let him finish his job
 He should he should have let them corner the Republican Guards
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 that's what everyone says
 E- everyone I talk to they says you know 
 it's real easy to say that
 Yeah 
 I don't think the higher ups were thinking about wh- what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine 
 They're going well it's not going to hurt us 
 so we're just going to let them go 
 but really we didn't think about the people that he was going tr- 
 and I mean he he's just 
 They yeah they they did they stuck right to their goals
 and right 
 what they were going to say 
 And the American people when this first started they were even reluctant to let them do that
 So they were they were playing it very safe 
 but you know it an ounce what do they say an ounce of hind sight is worth whatever
 Th- they I don't know they it Schwartz- Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done 
 and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it to you know the the go ahead to do it
 Because he had the fu- 
 he knew what was going to happen more than any of us 
 Because I didn't realize that 
 *[[slash error: utt3 and 4 as one]] it was going to make such a mess 
 I mean I feel really sorry for these people 
 these people are middle class people just like us 
 Can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood
 and you knew this 
 these people are going to come 
 and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you 
 Of course you're going just going pick everything up that you can carry 
 and you're going to run
 And it it's just too bad that we couldn't see that
 Well you know what I was hoping 
 I was hoping Iran was going to take a very dramatic stand and invade you know 
 and then like Iran's the big bad guy you know 
 but really if if they were going to save people's lives 
 Yeah 
 I know 
 it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict 
 but I I you know I almost swear I'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians 
 why they didn't go save 
 I mean I don't know if the Kurdish 
 I know the Shiite's are their people
 But I don't know 
 I think they have a bond with the the Kurds
 Yeah 
 I I think they should have just done more 
 and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid 
 It's it's just so complicated
 yeah 
 well you 
 knowing them they're very 
 I don't know 
 almost compare them to a very egotistical man
 You're damn right 
 I'm going to protect my family you know 
 so I I was amazed too 
 I was really I was really proud of them though that they stayed out of it 
 But 
 yeah 
 I was I 
 that part scared me 
 That that the Egyptians would pull out 
 and I just saw atomic bomb
