 I I think I am 
 It's it's been a while now 
 Yeah 
 I've 
 just recently I got married 
 and we bought a house 
 We're about fifty yards from the golf course
 but unfortunately the house is taking up my time
 So it's been it's been almost a year I guess since I've actually swung a club for a purpose
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 That's that's great
 Yeah 
 Now it's like I say it's been a while for me too 
 I I've got my wife motivated about it 
 and I think that's probably going to be one of the next investments is get her get her a set of clubs 
 and we'll get out of the driving range and and get some interest built up 
 and hopefully we can we can start in
 Really
 Well great great 
 That's good
 Yeah 
 same thing here
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 That's 
 I've got the same attitude 
 I I tell you 
 I started 
 I guess the first time I played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when I was in college
 And I took I took it as a P E course and then kind of left it alone for a while 
 and then finally got got into it when I was while I was still in school
 and since then we've made it 
 as as the friends start getting married and things like that we've made a tradition of having a a Thursday 
 well have have probably like like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding 
 And so it 
 that's back in South Dakota where I grew up
 and so that that's that's been my main my main involvement 
 is it seems like I go home and play golf more than I do around here 
 but eventually I get people to come and visit me in Dallas 
 and then I'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home
 Yeah
 Yep 
 yep
 okay
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's right
 it is it's it's a lot of fun especially if you can find somebody that's that's got the same level of interest 
 That seem to be the hardest thing 
 Well about 
 that's that's true of any sport you know 
 If you want to play tennis or racquetball 
 Right 
 and and people don't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time you know
 and and 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 That's right 
 yeah
 That's true
 That's true
 Well
 That that's that's so 
 Yeah 
 that's absolutely right 
 and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if you if you know 
 you gets you get in a rut if you do play a lot 
 but you play with the same people you you aren't going to learn anything
 After a short period once you learn everything they've got to offer 
 then you've basically tapped your resources there
 But I'd like to eventually I'd like to work up if if my wife does get interested and maybe get involved in a league in a in a mixed mixed doubles league or something like that
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Right
 Well that's good that's good that's sounds like a lot of fun
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it it sounds like we've got real similar situations
 I I I go home I've gone home every year now since I've moved to Dallas to to go pheasant hunting 
 and the the last time I I took my wife along 
 and k- kind of the same situation 
 She's she's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff 
 but She'll definitely she'll make the trip for fishing if that comes along 
 but it's it's interesting
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 well yeah 
 I've I've kind of formed the attitude that you know if I could just if I could pick two or three shots out out of my game every time and put them together on one hole then I do pretty good
 and then and I keep I keep rationalizing that well you know I can do it 
 I just got to do it all at th- on the same hole 
 and and then it will get better 
 and you just keep going 
 and in the meantime just enjoy what you're doing
 It it it really works that way 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Sure
 Sure 
 And well that's great
 Well you bet
 Okay 
 sounds like it
 Okay
 Bye
