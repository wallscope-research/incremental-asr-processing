 How do you feel about the Viet Nam war
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I saw that as well
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well were you ever in Viet Nam 
 or 
 I was much too young 
 I was born in sixty-seven 
 so 
 you know both my well both my brothers were draft age 
 but neither of them wound up going over which I think they were very happy for
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well so well do you do you feel that it was worth what we did over there
 Okay
 do you think I mean do you think our invest- the investment in lives and money was worth it
 I totally agree with that 
 What what effects do you think it's had on our country
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I think you know that's pretty typical that of the entire entire involvement over that you know that nothing was really addressed 
 it was- it wasn't you know it was never 
 we we announced that we were going to war
 it was such a gradual and subtle you know thi- you know increasement of of force that
 I vaguely remember we we had a we had a spy ship torpedoed or something
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 so do do do you think that like for example like in in this past war in the Persian Gulf war that that you see it seemed to me that that Bush was going going to extraordinary lengths to you know prepare the country for war
 Yeah
 Okay
 I wasn't really keeping count 
 But I guess 
 good-bye 
 Bye
