 Well what what do you think about the metric system 
 do you find it useable 
 Have you tried much with it
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 To use you mean 
 uh-huh 
 Yes
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 We 
 well I've lived both in the United States and and in a country where they do use the metric system 
 and so I've I've lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over 
 the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and pounds to kilom- kilograms 
 and I think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters
 how on earth am I every going to do the math
 *[[spelling]] And the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail or whatever and you know and leaving it at that 
 and you know a kilogram weighs about this much 
 and get used to it from scratch 
 cause I still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters 
 but I'm perfectly comfortable using either
 And I think the real problem with this this weird conversion yo- you see signs that say fifty-five miles per hour and you know whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour you know 
 people you know 
 it's hard to take it seriously
 And as long as both were given you basically just don't read the kilometers per hour 
 you just say well look read the miles per hour one 
 the other one must be for someone else
 I don't know 
 I mean even Britain has converted over 
 and we inherited this mess from them 
 and 
 Well I mean it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they they saw the light 
 I don't know why they we- were more able than we were 
 except I think that they probably just said well we're just going to start using the things now 
 and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to 
 That's true 
 that's that's probably true 
 and America does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting you know some other model
 I've never heard that one 
 that's very nice 
 so I'm all for the metric system and converting over 
 and I think 
 I guess my feeling is the way to do it is is to just start giving weights you know have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert 
 Remember me getting a package of something that said one pound 
 this is a package of dates mind you 
 it's was presumably something you weigh fairly precisely 
 it said one pound 
 and then in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty-four point six grams 
 And as near as I could tell seeing that was basically anti-metric propaganda 
 cause anyone who would say well look I can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty-four point six grams which of course they couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway 
 every time I see something like that I think well that's that's an anti-metric argument
 You don't
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that's what I was thinking by quick transition 
 I didn't mean you know I didn't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or anything you know 
 at midnight tonight we all switch over or anything
 I believe so 
 yeah 
 and I think they did it overnight 
 cause you know you can't do it gradually 
 That's an example of something you can't do gradually
 Yes 
 it does 
 A quantum leap from left to right hand drive 
 And they 
 but you know that must have taken 
 that was something that had to be done quickly you know because of external circumstances 
 but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe or the rest of continental Europe 
 and you know But that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate
 so I I I I I think it's essential that it's done 
 and I think the real trick is to avoid the you know 
 a little more attention to human psychology 
 and whereas people want round numbers 
 and after all the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers so they don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch 
 and so what the exact 
 the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented 
 Really I think
 Uh-huh 
 I saw that 
 I saw that the other day 
 I don- don't drink soda pop
 but I saw a two liter soda pop bottle 
 so yeah 
 things like that are a good start 
 and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in the the you know the odd numbers you know two point two pounds or something I think people will start getting a sense of gee the metric is the sensible one
 Yes 
 well get back to what you're doing 
 and I'll do the same 
 I enjoyed talking with you too
 Okay 
 Bye-bye
