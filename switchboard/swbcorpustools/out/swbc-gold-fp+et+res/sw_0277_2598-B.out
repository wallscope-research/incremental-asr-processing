 Do you want to start 
 G- 
 Did you watch DANCES WITH WOLVES 
 did you see the movie
 Did you like it
 I thought it was very well done
 How about GHOST
 Right 
 I feel the same way about that too 
 It was okay
 No 
 no 
 And wh- 
 let's see 
 the most recent ones that I've seen are those two GHOST and DANCES WITH WOLVES 
 but I rent videos 
 do you
 You you watch many
 Do you like the classics like GONE WITH THE WIND and you know the older movies
 Yeah 
 that was good 
 I think I've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies but in in you know a long time ago
 and like the MALTESE FALCON and all those 
 Yeah 
 that was good 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it's true
 I didn't see that one
 Really 
 Yeah
 Really 
 is that the one where the guy gets captured by that women
 Okay 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 right 
 Uh-huh 
 Did you see PACIFIC HEIGHTS
 I saw that one 
 that one wasn't that great either
 Well I didn't think so 
 no
 How about SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
 I know 
 I I wanted to see 
 I I was curious if you had seen it 
 and that 
 Yeah 
 That's us too 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 true 
 I know it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive
 really
 No
 Really
 I thought it was kind of maybe for kids more than ad- 
 Uh-huh
 part of it 
 I I never really watched the whole thing
 really
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that was pretty good though really
 When you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies you know 
 You see it for you know a couple of hours or an hour 
 and it really 
 there's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars and all the different stuff like that you know
 Whose your favorite actress or actor
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 That was good 
 I saw that movie too 
 That was very good
 FIELD OF DREAMS
 yeah 
 yeah 
 SILVERADO 
 who who was that with
 That 
 the nam- 
 the the title sounds familiar 
 I'm trying to thi- 
 really 
 I I might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although I wo- I would remember I think in with him in it
 How about REVENGE 
 did you see that with him
 With Anthony Quinn 
 I thought it was 
 I like everything he's done so far
 You know it's one of those movies that it's not a great movie 
 but it was okay
 Yeah 
 it was it was not a bad movie
 Yeah 
 that was excellent
 Now that's another one I wanted to see 
 Tha- 
 in fact that was advertised not too long ago
 Cable 
 Okay 
 I know I saw yeah something about it 
 Uh-huh 
 I don't know him
 No 
 I I don't think so
 Yes
 Okay 
 okay
 Yeah 
 yeah
 I know who you mean
 He was in HONEY DON'T SHRINK THE KIDS wasn't he
 okay 
 se- 
 all right 
 yeah 
 that's the one I was thinking of 
 But I have I've seen quite a few movies 
 I I enjoy them 
 I think that it's it's kind of like good entertainment An an escape type of thing
 How about some of the ads 
 do you go by the ads when you look at them or the reviews 
 Do they influence you a lot
 Yeah 
 Did you see GOODFELLAS
 That wa- that was pretty good 
 and 
 Uh-huh 
 I was just going to say th- you should see those fi- first if you can
 If y- if you read the book it's even better 
 The book was excellent
 Yeah 
 and I was a little disappointed in the third on- 
 it's GODFATHER THREE 
 It was not bad 
 but I expected more I think
 really
 Uh-huh
 How about Tom Cruise do you like his stuff COCKTAILS 
 or 
 yeah 
 that was good 
 I liked RAINMAN too
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 they sound familiar 
 I probably saw parts of those 
 You know a lot of times I'll wa- I'll start watching a movie 
 and I'm tired 
 and it 
 next thing you know it's it's 
 especially if there's commercial in it 
 and then the titles might sound familiar 
 but I really don't know what they're all about
 Is that the one set in the fifties or sixties
 Late fifties 
 yeah 
 I think I saw that one
 How about Meryl Streep
