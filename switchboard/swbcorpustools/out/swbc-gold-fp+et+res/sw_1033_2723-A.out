 About how many calls have you made on this system
 okay 
 yeah
 I I only started doing it after I started getting calls and said heck 
 that's right 
 I'm supposed to make a few calls 
 So I started about a month ago 
 and I 
 this is getting close to twenty here which is I think is about all our little gift book goes up to 
 but I don't really know
 I've got about twelve tickets in the mail 
 Do you have 
 you've a few
 Okay 
 medical 
 go ahead 
 I'm I'm medical 
 That's mine
 Yeah 
 I I'm benefits 
 Go ahead you first
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 The one 
 it's kind of like 
 automobile insurance 
 the ones that I think are the highest and important to me I hope I never have to use them really per se although I've used medical a little bit
 that well that one certainly is high 
 I I worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening 
 so I like to reverse that trend and say I'd like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better
 Then sal- sal- salary continuance I've never used that one 
 I hope I never will 
 but that's kind of like an insurance thing 
 I sure like that one
 That's like automobile insurance 
 You never want to get in an accident 
 but it 
 you like to have it there
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 With T I or somebody else
 Uh-huh
 right 
 yeah
 
 Yeah
 Right 
 And outside consultants 
 Didn't they have an outside consultant too
 Did they have an outside consultant like a the employ- 
 Yeah
 Right
 really
 Yeah 
 they seem to be do- doing a good job of that 
 I'm in facilities 
 and our organization built builds those facilities over in Park Central now
 And I guess they've been using them for six months now 
 And I've known several engineers that got laid off 
 and they said it's like getting a Ph D almost 
 they 
 the much they learn over there you know after they've been laid off 
 one engineer said it was really an education 
 He he just learned like you 
 he said he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own 
 He was very thankful for that too
 To have an office 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well he said he learned so much 
 and how 
 he thought he thought he had a Ph D in how to get a job after he was through the whole process for for several months 
 He did eventually get a job
 Yeah apparently 
 It's very sophisticated 
 And I guess it may be one of the best that anyone's doing
 Right 
 You're absolutely right 
 That's a good one
 What do you think about pensions 
 Anything on that or 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 What do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a four O one account 
 I I've been thinking about that for years 
 I know 
 That's what I'm saying that that pensions 
 you see just like you were you're saying you've only got so many years 
 say you work for two three companies you take your pension with you after you're vested And then just add the money together like you do with a four O one account you know
 it's your account period 
 It doesn't matter where you go or anything 
 That's your account to roll over
 No 
 no 
 there isn't 
 I I'm saying that's the question 
 What do you think could be better 
 and I'm saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will 
 I think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose 
 So you work for a company seven years 
 well social security's going to go to way I think 
 and you can or you can invest your own money 
 You have no control over your social security 
 And it's not paid for by the current 
 like when 
 say we retire after the year two thousand social security's paid for by the twenty-five year olds 
 You know they may rebel and you won't have any social security Where if your money was in your account I mean you can never lose it 
 it's there
 You don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know 
 That's just a thought 
 I mean I 
 if they say which 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company 
 maybe you had to put some money in it too 
 I don't really know 
 But I I can see where they'd need to do something on that because the statistics are 
 you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own you know 
 You work for five six seven 
 and y- y- 
 a lot of people I know guys 
 Yeah 
 I have too 
 but not not quite that often 
 but yeah 
 I've only got I've got I guess fourteen now here at T I 
 and I hope to make twenty-five which 
 say if something happened to me 
 I mean you know they lay me off 
 so you have a pension 
 but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one 
 It would be nice if they could get them together
 I do worry about medical though 
 Again knock wood that I haven't used it 
 I guess you 
 I'm sorry 
 you really do use it throughout the year because you get your teeth fixed and all that 
 I mean I 
 but I'm not 
 I'm talking about major items 
 I haven't used it for anything major
 I'm glad it's there though
 Yeah
 I have the regular 
 I again I just 
 I haven't 
 I can't complain about it because I haven't used it 
 and every time I needed it it it it's you know fallen right in line for the the minor things 
 I guess I'm the one just supporting most of the others
 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 I think it's two seventy-five for a family 
 but the dental is right away if you 
 exams 
 Okay 
 Yeah 
 the medical you have to have a deductible
 Yeah 
 right
 Well drugs are okay 
 now I'm on that plan where I take blood pressure medicine 
 If you take an allergy medicine so anything you need a prescription for for more than six months you get it for used to be six bucks 
 they just raised it to twelve
 Yeah 
 that's a typical that's a typical one that's in there 
 The forms are right in personnel
 Fact you may be able to take care take advantage of that 
 It's through Baxter Labs 
 Maybe you still can do that 
 Do you do you buy your pills one at a time
 Well tur- turn in your forms 
 Go right to personnel 
 I don't know whether you have to about an H M O 
 I don't think so 
 You turn 
 you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription 
 and they're twelve dollars 
 again they just were six 
 they just raised them to twelve this year Twelve dollars for a three months supply Or whatever whatever the the amount is 
 I don't want to say three months 
 but it's a lot cheaper 
 allergy medicine's really expensive 
 and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive 
 I take two
 Go right to personnel 
 They got the forms in personnel 
 and maybe maybe I'll tell you go something you didn't know about in benefits 
 I do it 
 yeah 
 you know it's a very common thing
 It's through Baxter Labs 
 tell 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 What else 
 I'm sure we're getting close to our five minutes whatever here
 What other benefits 
 Yeah 
 salary continuation 
 I think that's a great one 
 but again a hope I never use that one
 That means you're really sick if you have to use that one
 I'm satisfied with the vacation 
 I don't know what else you know 
 you say say you get another week and 
 I'm well I only got fourteen years 
 so I'll get another week when I hit fifteen
 So that's that's fair 
 I mean it's reasonable 
 Four weeks is a lot I think 
 I know some people who have twenty-five years and thirty and they want more 
 but you know 
 
 Uh-huh
 Well the way things go I think I'm going to have to work till I'm seventy-five whether I quit and or when I retire get a part-time job
