 Well what a wh- what do we currently have 
 I have a Subaru G O X T
 Eighty-eight
 it's not pretty old
 So you think their quality control's going down over there kind of 
 Well I I I think we're going to see that I think that the quality that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit while American carmakers are trying to get their put together 
 so 
 But but that's one reason 
 I I've had no problems with my Subaru 
 that's one reason I went with it because I Subaru had a good reputation for you know low maintenance 
 so 
 Well really 
 there's there's no question 
 but you have a nineteen 
 I mean I've got to see if 
 I mean I've seen and I've had friends that have like eighty-one or eighty Celicas
 and those things just keep ticking
 I mean they just they can rack up a a hundred fifty K on them
 and they're still beating on them
 and it's just amazing 
 and then they got 
 and you know they're not making them like that now d- d- you know
 so 
 but they're still they're still a lot I think definitely better than the American carmaker system 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well maybe you need to unload it on somebody el- 
 Yeah 
 that's a lot
 well
 Anyway 
 so what's your next purchase supposed to be
 really 
 if you had a choice of your car what would you get
 I'm not sure I'm real familiar with the body style on that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 okay 
 yeah 
 Do you have do you have a family
 Okay 
 well that's probably influenced maybe a little bit 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 well when I bought my car it was right out of college 
 and you know I always been looking for something sporty 
 and I ended up getting you know basically something that I could you know afford
 The only gripe I have is performance 
 I probably 
 a few girls that I've gone out with I've had like Mazda R X seven's and stuff 
 and they're they're pretty fun to drive 
 so so I think that's what I I'm going to have to get next time around I keep I keep hold- holding off 
 and then I could I could upgrade now if I wanted to 
 but I just I 
 it's just such a huge expense 
 and and I I'm just going to keep holding off 
 but I'm definitely going to look for something in the you know nice perpor- you know 
 Yeah 
 I'm in 
 are you still there
 Hello
 Okay
 Wonder what happened
 
 anyway but I'll probably 
 it just depends 
 I know that's what I want 
 but I don't know if I'll get myself to spend that kind of money 
 you're looking at you know for a new R X seven or a Supra or something 
 you're looking at twenty-five K or something <> that like 
 and so anyway but Anyway my ultimate car though the the one that I really want is five sixty or so Mercedes 
 so 
 maybe someday 
 Yeah
 That's the only one that I you know 
 I se- you know I see you know early on that that that says it says you there
 Hello
 Okay
 I hope it's not my 
 you there
 It may be my phone 
 anyway it's the only car that says you know sporty and class 
 so 
 kind of what I'm 
 but it's 
 at the other one my brother's got a Miata 
 and those are fun
 And i- 
 Yeah 
 well he did he had a a red Miata
 and he actually 
 they came out with a European racing green Miata that's a limited edition
 they're only going to make like three or four thousand 
 So he went out 
 and he traded the other one in and got this one
 and I'm like but I haven't seen one yet either 
 but supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel
 so it's it's very authentic 
 and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be may be a good investment 
 If it 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 But I think 
 hello
 okay 
 yeah 
 I got off my pace or my cordless phone anyway hope it's not going bad <> 
 it's going to bump me out 
 but he I think he he only spent you know the low twenty's 
 so I don't know
 Well I don't know 
 I think the demands gone all down a little bit 
 I think you can 
 the prices aren't as high you know 
 and the the mu- Miata was first introduced 
 Wh- 
 yeah 
 the demand is so high that you know they were going to retail them around like thir- you know thirteen standard you know 
 and you get your options your looking at fifteen or si- fifteen 
 but there were you know people were buying them for nineteen and twenty
 and they they may have gone down a little bit 
 but I 
 they're still pretty much in demand 
 I think there's another car coming in 
 it's supposed to come out and compete with that Miata
 and I can't remember what I read about that 
 but so that's 
 I mean I would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular 
 so 
 But 
 yeah
 yeah 
 and the Mitsubishi three thousand G T is the same same 
 Yeah 
 well that's that's that's the same manufacturer 
 and st- so they just market them
 But yeah 
 those are and those are supposed to be very performance power I mean they're there is yeah big time
 Yeah
 I think the- they're only around twenty-nine K
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I'm being single 
 and no other responsibilities for yourself I guess you know it's I can I can I've been pretty happy 
 I've I've haven't tried to upgrade myself right now 
 that's you know I could I could have you know get something nice and upgrade 
 but I just I'm consulting right now 
 so 
 I just made my first job hop about eight months ago 
 so
