 So what are your favorite shows
 really
 QUANTUM LEAP
 Did you see it the other night
 That was that was pretty good
 What do you 
 with the psychic and everything
 Okay 
 Yeah 
 I like I like NORTHERN EXPOSURE and HOME IMPROVEMENT
 You've never seen NORTHERN EXPOSURE
 it's a great show
 Really 
 Yeah 
 we like it too 
 Have you seen the movie
 you haven't seen any of them
 well they're good 
 they're real good 
 They're they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies though
 Which ones are you watching the new ones
 okay 
 Yeah
 Well they're they're a lot different 
 But I like I like the older ones because at that time you know they were really futuristic you know
 And the newer ones are I guess the newer ones are real futuristic too 
 but I like I like both of them
 Really
 No 
 Not really 
 It's not really like a soap opera 
 but but it's 
 but that's true 
 I mean you you learn more about the characters and stuff 
 but that's the way all shows are now
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well it seems like they always show COLOMBO the same ones over and over though you know what I'm saying like that one where he goes to college 
 or is this is there a series on
 Okay 
 Yeah 
 I saw that one 
 See that was a rerun
 Yeah 
 I wondered if that's 
 see I don't know if that's a the movie of the week or or what 
 but it seems like there's only about four or five different ones 
 and then then they keep showing them over and over
 He was a movie director 
 and he had that gal killed
 Okay
 That was pretty good though 
 Uh-huh
 No kidding
 What is it that 
 there's something I watch something I watch on Saturdays 
 and I can't remember what it is 
 Now I used to watch TWIN PEAKS
 You never saw that
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that was a different soap opera
 But it was it was a different type of show
 I didn't like the way it ended though
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 they didn't they only did it for I think two years
 But it's all over now
