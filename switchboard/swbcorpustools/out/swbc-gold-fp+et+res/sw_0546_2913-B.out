 Gosh 
 I like just about anything 
 We I think the last one we saw was TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES PART TWO
 Well we don't have any kids 
 but we like them anyway
 we're late twenties
 No
 gosh
 Oh
 It was 
 it was actually better than the first one I thought
 What's the last movie you saw
 Oh 
 we were just when when the topic came up we I was asking my husband right quick what's the last movies we saw 
 He said well GHOST and TURTLES 
 I really liked it
 Not too awful bad
 Yeah
 Did you see PRETTY WOMAN
 gosh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 once in a while when I'm home
 Yeah
 Okay
 Yeah 
 it does
 Yeah
 I think you would really like PRETTY WOMAN 
 it was it was really a 
 it made you feel really good 
 It was just a happy movie
 Yeah 
 I saw that one
 I I was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was
 Yeah
 I don't like that
 I don't see why they have to do that 
 I mean I mean n- everybody knows that it that the the language is there so they could just ignore it and you know use different words instead I think
 But I I think lately PRETTY WOMAN'S been my favorite 
 I went and bought the video 
 I've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times
 That's okay 
 That's okay 
 Now Now I haven't seen PRETTY IN PINK 
 that had does that have *[[slash error]] Molly Ringwald
 *[[br]] I think I think SIXTEEN CANDLES was the name of it
 I haven't seen it either
 I do
 gosh
 Oh
 I don't know
 Bu- 
 Probably know him if I saw him
 I was just thinking another good one I saw not too long ago was SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY
 That that's that's Julia Roberts' new movie
 Yeah 
 she's 
 this one 
 you know PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and a romance
 and and this one was a lot more dramatic
 Y- well 
 it was like it was a it was a mystery 
 She disappeared from her hu- husband who was abusing her
 Yeah 
 yeah
 No 
 it came out in the theater
 And I think you know around here it's all ready quit playing 
 But I don't I don't know if it's still playing any where else
 But it was it was it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat
 okay
 because we saw it probably four or five months ago
 Yeah 
 he's he was a real psycho in the movie
 It was it was scary
 Oh yeah 
 boy I I didn't like it
 No 
 it was 
 I didn't like the way it ended
 Uh-huh
 Might have been Michael Douglas that starred in it
 *[[listen]] Yeah 
 it was Michael Douglas
 Huh-uh
 It was I I it was it was weird 
 It was a different movie from anything I've ever seen
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that would be kind of hard for us 
 we've only got one bathroom 
 I don't know h- 
 That wouldn't be too bad
 Get around
 Well did you see FATAL ATTRACTION
 I know it's going to be on on the on C B S Tuesday night 
 an and that's kind of what in a way you know how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff
 That's kind of how WAR OF THE ROSES was
 Parts of parts of WAR OF THE ROSES was funny 
 but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious 
 and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling you know
 I I've heard about that 
 but I don't know what it's about
 Yeah
 I love Disney movies
 I mean they're some of the best of that are made
 Oh go- 
 I don't think so
 Nope 
 I didn't see that
 So do I 
 and a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something 
 and and you're not sure whether it will be any good or not 
 so sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than 
 Yeah 
 now we saw that 
 and i- and they're coming out with a sequel to it
 It was funny
 And and WORKING GIRL is really good
 That was good
 Yeah
 Yes 
 I did 
 that that just reminded me of that 
 Did you like it
