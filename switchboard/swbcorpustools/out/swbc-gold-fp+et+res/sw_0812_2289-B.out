 Okay 
 well is your 
 does your city have mandatory recycling
 there there're some places that are strongly encouraging it 
 and that they city will pick it up 
 That's been one of the arguments here 
 I'm just sitting here looking We've got four bins of glass and plasticine <> stuff 
 But we have to carry it some distance 
 and some places you can sell your recyclables 
 and for example our church was collecting newspapers
 Well it turns out that so much 
 the problem in Texas is that they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to reprocess it
 It requires an ex- it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it 
 and so the value has gone down 
 It turns out it wasn't worth for the church to do 
 Well
 Yeah 
 well see that's 
 in in Dallas there no plan to build 
 I think there there's some in East Texas there's some pulp mills 
 but you have to go to Houston 
 and it's interesting 
 and then there's places that will buy metal 
 and they still buy aluminum can and likes that
 *[[can> cans likes> like]] Well do you do do you do recycling
 Oh
 Well do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans
 so it's worth taking them back 
 Well see we don't have 
 We have we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles
 that's it 
 you'll you'll 
 there is a down side to all this you know about no good deed going unpunished that my mother sells trees that they make paper out of 
 and so every time I recycle newspapers in fact there's a there's a 
 Kimberly and Clark the makers of kleenex and such has a a big paper mill 
 In fact I almost went to work for them 
 I was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me 
 It's twenty or thirty miles from my house 
 Every time you recycle that's one less tree my mother can sell 
 and So it's a question should I be diligent and and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood
 But it's an interesting point though that you know everybody's so anxious to recycle 
 and I suppose it does provide some gainful employment 
 but 
 Well but in general I think it's a good idea because like the glass you can't argue that the glass 
 it doesn't biodegrade and and the plastics obviously
 So we might as well recycle those
 Yeah
 Well that's what we've got 
 We started about New Year's we decided we'd get ambitious 
 Well we took one load over there 
 and now we've got these containers filling up with stuff 
 and you know it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there
 Yeah
 But every little bit helps 
 right
 Well do you have separate trash cans at your desk
 Well we have we have one that's recyclable and and then for lunch sacks and waste food
 and they gave us a list of things that aren't re- 
 and it turns out it's not so bad 
 I I get a lot of reports that that are covered in plastic or plas- like saran wrap or something {D anyway 
 } and then cardboard there's a few 
 it's interesting that we're we're recycling computer type paper
 And and one day they'll pick up 
 the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper 
 and then the next day they'll pick up the other 
 so 
 Depending on how much 
 you know and there's a lot of actually it works pretty well 
 and then we have a waste cans for aluminum in the in the break areas at work
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's an interesting distinction
 Yeah
 Well see well see those of us that don't have state income taxes 
 yet that's the big debate here in Texas that the legislature wants to put one in 
 and it's interesting what people get upset about 
 it really is
 Well no 
 the the big issue was is is when we moved here a few years ago is whether it was okay for you to drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck And throw it out at the in 
 We're not civilized now you can no longer you cannot drink beer and drive 
 but but it was it was actually legal 
 Yeah
 Well you know the other Well the other thing is it also is is a is a a good habit to just to conserve resources you know where they you know because you get in the habit of that you think in terms of of of of things like saving
