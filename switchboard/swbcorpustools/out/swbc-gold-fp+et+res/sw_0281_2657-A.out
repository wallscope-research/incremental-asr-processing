 Huh 
 Okay
 Well I don't know if I know anything or not
 but I've I've got some opinions on it
 See those type of people that that have the most opinions ones that don't know anything 
 Well I've had teenagers 
 and I now have grandchildren that are teenagers 
 and I don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective 
 I think this "me" generation has gone far too far 
 And the young people are overly impressed 
 And I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a m- far more disadvantaged viewpoint
 I personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though
 But they have 
 I read somewhere 
 and I'm I'm out on a limb here some type of college volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college 
 and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the lower income brackets of the United States 
 Have you ever heard about that one
 really
 And this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education
 But she got credits for it
 That's very interesting
 Huh
 Yeah 
 I think that is an excellent program 
 I really do 
 I like that 
 And it's it's beneficial to the small towns too because they really really have have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the Metroplex
 Right 
 you know if if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldn't be convenient
 but we could find one
 We wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that
 So I I can see the advantage to that one 
 The Peace Corps itself is really a dying out isn't it
 It's still in existence
 I want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm dig their own wells set up their schools
 Yes 
 They 
 It's not a program to teach them to use the American money it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant
 And yes 
 you're right 
 I think it's a sixties program 
 I think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he 
 that was his big deal
 Right 
 Right 
 <> I think I I've singled out my grandchildren 
 and but actually they're they're pretty good along those lines as compared to what I have seen from other people's children and grandchildren mine aren't really that bad 
 but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good
 But there's a 
 Mandatory just like like the draft
 No
 Every time you 
 They could buy their way out
 Right 
 you know they they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat 
 But <> I'm wondering if there's another issue here 
 and maybe this is why this has died out 
 Can you go into 
 and this wasn't the question 
 but it's it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults 
 can they go in there and can anyone go into well out of 
 the Kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time 
 but say I think Bangladesh would have been a good example or some some really desperate situation 
 and teach them to farm and teach them 
 and it doesn't do any good
 I don't know that it does 
 I I don't know that if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out 
 You know we're losing certain races of people 
 There are people now that are obsolete point and fact just just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people that are endangered or obsolete 
 And I'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out 
 There's a German word for it that's elegant 
 but I never can remember what it was 
 but but that they're they're being winnowed because they're where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially
 and one of the quick examples is the Aborigines
 when we were in Australia <> 
 sad little things I felt sorry for them Because their society isn't there anymore 
 and their belief system and a- all their structured of theirs all the structures of their society are gone essentially
 And they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else 
 and that's sad
 But I don't think there's any way you could go the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people 
 and I don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either
 So I I'm wondering if the Peace Corps is really an effective tool
 Good point
 We've got enough without lea- without a passport 
 there's plenty
 Yes 
 I think we ought to worry about our own species
 I wonder now in 
 and I've been out of school too long to answer this 
 but I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses
 That's the last thing you want to do
 Yeah 
 that's exactly it
 They're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it 
 Now come on let's be realistic
 that's just not realistic
 Right
 No 
 we're not I don't think 
 I think that's more realistic than goin- making them go in the Peace Corps
 I think that's a lot more realistic 
 I I think that we should be spending more time 
 and and again I don't think the the Peace Corps is is as successful now simply because it's not It doesn't fit the circumstance anymore
 we've got plenty 
 in fact we've got far too many 
 You're in what r- Flower Mound
 I was 
 that's exactly what I was going to ask you 
 Have you ever have have you been downtown recent-
