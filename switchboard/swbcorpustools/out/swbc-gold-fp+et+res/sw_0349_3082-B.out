 Yes
 are you really
 Where is it going to be
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 that's marvelous 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I'm sure location's really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be
 Uh-huh 
 We have factions when it's one part 
 we I have one reunion on my mother's side 
 and we found that if it's in a certain part of Texas some people come 
 and if it's elsewhere other people come
 we never get them at both of them
 it seems like 
 so I think we need to find a new place 
 Uh-huh
 
 that's a neat idea
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 How many people Jim are involved
 Wow
 Yeah 
 well I guess ours probably isn't that big 
 Our family is dwindling for one thing
 And I often feel funny because I'm in a branch that's all but died
 I just have one aunt and my family 
 So sometimes when these other families get together they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids 
 and we're kind of off on the sidelines 
 But it does remind us that we have family and roots
 So we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it
 Uh-huh
 that's great
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So there's lots to do
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 that's true 
 Well that's neat 
 I think think they're really fun 
 We go to mine regularly 
 and then we go to my husband's occasionally down in Temple 
 and he has a large family 
 so it's it's fun when we go to that one
 Oh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that that is a problem with the distance 
 The people that we have that don't come are out El Paso way
 and it's just too much for all of them all of that group to travel 
 Right 
 But then we have the same attitude when it's out there although this year we're going out 
 They're going to have it at Fort Davis
 and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And choose some place that everybody's going to like as far as food and all that 
 That's a heavy burden
 No 
 Uh-huh
 Well I think 
 Yeah 
 and it's it's good for kids to know that they have other family
 boy
 what fun
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Probably lots of laughs
 Uh-huh 
 Well it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along 
 Ours ours is still kind of loosely organized 
 and the same people usually get stuck with doing it 
 And they do it as a labor of love 
 So the officer idea is a good idea
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and it's not fair that everybody not contribute
 Uh-huh
 Well thanks a lot I enjoyed talking to you 
 Bye
