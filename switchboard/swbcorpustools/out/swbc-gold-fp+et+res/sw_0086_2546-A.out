 I guess I don- don't really have a problem with capital punishment 
 I'm not really sure what the exact specifications are for Texas 
 I know that they have capital punishment for certain crimes 
 and that's probably the way I feel about it is is it kind of depends on the crime that's committed 
 My belief all my life I guess has been that that if you take someone else's life then you automatically are giving up yours in place of it 
 But I don't 
 seems to be a lot of controversy about that 
 That's true 
 I guess well there's there's probably two or three different types of of views as far as the controversy goes 
 I can see where if a life was taken by accident or I don't know what you'd call it not premeditated or I guess primarily by accident there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for 
 but I lean towards if it's premeditated or if it's kind of a habitual or or a habit that a tendency that people may get into then I guess I don't really have a problem with it 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that's what aggravates a lot of people is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty 
 and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months 
 No 
 Right
 No 
 it's not 
 You think of your chances of getting the death penalty after cre- committing a crime are really pretty slim right now 
 And you can probably spend a lot of time or maybe eventually just waiting it out
 and that's where a lot of aggravation comes I think is is these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process
 they may spend years 
 and you know the last I heard it was costing ten twenty thirty thousand dollars a year to keep these guys waiting
 Yeah
 To yeah to carry it out
 It sort of takes the justice out of the justice system
 Yeah
 It should be over and done with
 Yeah 
 it is 
 And she winds up being a a victim day after day after day
 Right
 She She's an emotional victim 
 And you know the like you say the cops that are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work basically go out the window
 Yes 
 they are
 Well that's about five minutes 
 so unless you've got something else well 
 It's a pleasure talking with you
 Okeydoke 
 good-bye
