 I pushed it
 So how do you use your credit cards
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's me 
 I won't use one that I have to pay an annual fee
 you know and I'm like you I I use it well to buy my gas with 
 my Sh- my Shell credit card I use that 
 and then like my Emporium card and Weinstocks card I use that 
 but I'm like you 
 I usually pay it off as soon as I get my bill 
 Why I don't just write a check I don't know
 You know it's just really weird 
 but I I don't carry a lot of cash with me because I'm always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse
 Yeah 
 you know enough for a phone call 
 and that's about all
 But other than that that's the that's the way I use them 
 I know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got they c- they can't charge any more you know 
 and I think that's terrible
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 because if anything ever happens that you do need to you know you have excellent credit 
 why it really does help
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 well I think it's better to use credit cards too like I say because yo- there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing
 and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket they're going to hit you over the head
 I know 
 It just you know it just seems like they're somebody's always watching 
 So I just don't I don't carry money 
 I'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off you know
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 right
 Yeah 
 right 
 And you know some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything you know 
 I don't know why they don't unless you have to spend a certain amou- 
 I don't know 
 but I notice that some of them don't even look you know 
 they just slide it in there and pass it back to you you know 
 so I don't think that's right 
 I think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well let's see 
 what else can I say about credit cards
 
 Yeah 
 I don't I don't 
 that that's that Sears Discovery Card 
 is that what that
 Yeah 
 Now I don't have that one you know
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 you mean for for your using your credit card you get like a rebate or something
 Uh-huh
 I see
 Uh-huh
 I see
 Yeah 
 well I'll
