 Well since I'm in college I mean I haven't seen that much change 
 I'm kind of young still 
 I don't know how much it changed in the last twenty years anyway 
 But I don't know 
 Do you do you have an idea of of how much
 Uh-huh
 okay
 Yeah 
 right 
 Well I can remember are from from my childhood were the disco days 
 and maybe that's changed a lot the way the way people dress 
 and 
 More lax
 Uh-huh
 Maybe a people are a little o- more open-minded than maybe they used to be
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like you know Pro-Life and and Pro- Choice in in the special interest groups maybe like amnesty 
 yeah 
 maybe people are a little a little more free to express their opinions socially free
 yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Right 
 Just wasn't socially acceptable
 Yeah 
 maybe maybe too a big social change that's that's maybe for the worst is is is how the people's views on on relationships has changed you know 
 and now we have now we have several you know we have to worry about AIDS 
 and we have to worry about maybe people are becoming more aware more more afraid of relationships

 I I I imagine you're right 
 I I teach swim lessons a lot 
 and and to see what see what kids talk about when you know they're they're open about well you know 
 kids are a lot more educated now than I think that that like we were at that age about a lot of things 
 You know besides what besides what they learn from from our social environment is their education is just amazing 
 Kids are kids are learning you know 
 their math is just 
 every year algebra goes down a grade you know 
 and and students learn it earlier
