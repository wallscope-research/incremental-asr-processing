 Well it'll be real easy for us
 because we're both my husband and I are vegetarians
 So yeah 
 So that's the first thing we look for is if we can eat there or not
 We're not vegan vegetarians 
 We do we're ovolacto 
 We do eat eggs and and milk products
 I used to be a complete vegan vegetarian where I didn't eat any animal products at all
 But it was it's really difficult in the area if you don't have you know the products that you can get 
 And if you go out to dinner there's virtually you know there's not a whole lot of things you can get
 Yeah 
 I think maybe if you were somewhere like California where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants and stuff 
 But here basically you go to an Italian restaurant or you go to a Mexican restaurant you know where you can get foods that you know where you have a little bit more variety as far as the pastas or the the corn meal you know or something
 But Yeah
 yeah 
 you have to watch that too 
 All you know some of the restaurants here they will you know l- 
 you can ask them and they'll tell you whether or not they use like lard or you know animal fat to cook with
 So but so that's that 
 we don't really eat out too much
 We we tend to eat at home 
 And actually you know I think we we we get a ha- we have a healthier diet than the average person
 I've been a vegetarian for two years now 
 My husband has been one for just over a year now
 And so 
 Definitely 
 And it it makes you more aware of what you're eating
 Because you you have to be
 I mean you you k- 
 I think you you you balance the foods you know 
 you're more aware of what nutrient you know value each thing has and minerals 
 And you're just more aware of food for energy for energy sake 
 Well that's just it 
 you you do have to figure it out And and you know to get proteins and things 
 And when I was a vegan it's you know 
 you have to consider calcium and iron and things like that you you're not even getting through your milk products
 your egg products If you don't eat any of those 
 but actually you can get everything you need through vegetables 
 I mean there are tra- there are there are 
 you actually you can get more calcium through leafy green vegetables than you can get through milk products
 A lot of people don't know that
 Well the thing is that milk products 
 our bodies don't don't 
 the lactose 
 that kind of milk it doesn't 
 our 
 we we tend to 
 what's it called 
 We don't synthesize the the calcium the same way
 Yeah 
 We we slough some of it 
 we we send we send some of it out because it our body doesn't accept some of it
 So we're not utilizing we're 
 when it when it gets rid of some of that that we can't use it get rids it gets rid of some of the calcium Whereas when we eat say broccoli you utilize all of it
 You utili- 
 your your body accepts all of the broccoli
 So it's like it's like say a person using vitamins as opposed to vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food
 Your body just doesn't accept vitamins and the minerals in the the vitamins in supplements that it does in regular food
 you know So 
 But we both we both feel much healthier much healthier 
 And I couldn't consider going back to eating
 Yeah 
 Well now I changed for ethical reasons
 And my husband has changed 
 He feels more ethically about it 
 But he he in the beginning began for health reasons
 But now he he feels like I do 
 That he looks at the things that he eats 
 and he realizes what they are before he eats them 
 And he you know 
 Yeah 
 Plus he eats 
 we both think more about I thought more of about it as far as what it was I was eating you know as a living creature
 And now we both think a lot of well what is it we're eating in relation to what it's going to give to our bodies
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well we do too 
 I mean I was raised in 
 we're in cattle country
 And people here buy a half a cow and put it in their freezer
 you know And that's that's the way I 
 and I 
 believe you me it wasn't easy to give up to give up a hamburger
 That that was one of my favorite foods was was a a was a good steak or a hamburger
 But you know I suppose if you really believe in something it's You you adjust your life
 because your mind 
 You your you 
 inside yourself you just it's not right
 So but 
 yes Yeah
 So what do you look for when you 
 Uh-huh
 Do you normally when you're traveling do you look for places that's established that that you've been to before or are you willing to try new places 
 Yeah 
 Like a chain restaurant or something
 Uh-huh
 As opposed to like a cafeteria kind of <> situation 
 Yeah
 Well no 
 I don't think so 
 I think it's just your 
 because I I prefer to be waited on too 
 I just 
 if you're going to go out to eat why not have the whole service you know
 Why not get the whole 
 I guess because we don't go out that much
 I feel like it's a treat
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Oh 
 Light menu you mean like cooked light or 
 I see
 Uh-huh 
 Not a lot of gravy and things like that
 You know I I like those too
 I like those too because some seems like sometimes it's you order a meal you order their dinner meal and it's like they're trying to find out how much you can eat 
 Or 
 or 
 Or or like evidently people go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain 
 and maybe they're afraid that people are going to complain or something
 Uh-huh 
 And I think that's a shame
 I mean I must admit sometimes I do like a buffet 
 But but I think that they just tend to make you you say well I've have got all I can eat
 or or you know it's one of these situations where nobody's going to restrain what you eat the amount that you eat
 And I think that peo- that we just tend to eat overeat
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well at least it's fruit and stuff there 
 Maybe it's not too bad
 Yeah
 Just for food it does seem like it
 Yeah 
 But 
 We like we do like international food 
 so we take 
 I like cu- 
 we like Indian food
 and I love Italian food
 and 
 Chinese 
 but 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 That's one thing that I wish we had more of 
 Because where we're from it's it's pretty limited 
 and it's 
 most of the restaurants are they tend to be you know American style food
 And we don't have too many w- 
 you have to go all the way to Dallas
 And so it really is a treat
 because 
 you know we don't make a trip sixty-five eighty you know sixty-five to eighty <> miles Depending how far in Dallas it is
