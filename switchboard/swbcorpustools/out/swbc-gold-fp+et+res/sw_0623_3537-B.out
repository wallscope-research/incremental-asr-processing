 Well I watched something on T V a couple of months ago by General ex Surgeon General Koop
 And he talked about Canada's system 
 and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that 
 but the expensive stuff heart operations and things they have a managed scarcity 
 And they said that in Canada there were as many heart trauma centers as there is in San Francisco 
 So in one city of in America there's as many hospitals that are equipped to do hosp- heart operations as in the entire area of Canada 
 and that's kind of spooky
 Uh-huh
 Do you think that it's just medical guys 
 What about you know you know how expensive new equipment and technology is 
 That's where I think most of the cost is coming
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 great 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 No 
 Yeah 
 I'll have to agree with you there 
 but there's another problem 
 and that's the how litigious our society is 
 If the doctor makes a mistake he can be sure that he's going to be hauled into court
 Uh-huh
 No 
 it doesn't
