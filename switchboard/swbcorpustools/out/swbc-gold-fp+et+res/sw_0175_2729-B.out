 Well I had I had a German Shepherd before this one 
 and when she died it just it just absolutely destroyed me 
 I mean I was just you know 
 I couldn't even talk about it for months 
 and so I decided well that's it 
 I'm not going to do this anymore 
 And then God gave me this dog 
 so 
 Uh-huh

 Well you just do

 The vet called her a golden mix 
 like who knows you know
 But she's she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color you know
 And and her nose is that pink you know
 she doesn't have a brown nose 
 and her ey- she's sort of unicolor you know eyes are the same color and everything 
 so I named her Rosebud
 and a friend of mine said th- she that she gre- 
 this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had a pet cow named Rosebud 
 and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name 
 said my cow lived seventeen years

 we we had a little pool
 and she was she did not want any part of swimming 
 but she liked to to get in the pool on the first step 
 She'd just get on the first step and lay down You know in the summertime when it's really really hot
 And she'd just lay there on that step and just you know cool off 
 Uh-huh
