 Hi
 My name's Ken
 And you're in Texas 
 right
 Everybody's in Texas 
 God
 I'm in Rochester New York 
 Everybody else but one has been in Texas
 Okay 
 well I guess we should get on with this
 did you get the message about what it was 
 right
 Okay 
 go ahead 
 I'm going to hit the button 
 Okay 
 do you think that the Soviet Union represents a threat to us
 That's interesting 
 I don't 
 I I suspect they're not our biggest threat anymore
 I suspect it's probably some crazy man like Saddam Hussein who's our biggest threat 
 but I wonder if they're I wonder how much of a threat they are 
 I agree with you that that they'll always be somewhat of a threat given that they have that there's just it's just so big 
 and there's just so much military machine there
 Right
 But I wonder how much longer they're going to be a them 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I agree 
 I mean if we were to if if something were to happen I'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of for the sake of of of unity against us or something if if if need be 
 But 
 Yeah 
 actually I noticed this + I mean this this this most recent scare of his where he said or he just decided that instead of having instead of having I can't think of the word now if there are any demonstrations for in favor of Boris Yeltsin he decided well I'll just cancel all demonstrations altogether
 So I I I think that he he he's actually 
 he I think is becoming very dangerous because he's making those people angry at him 
 and he's also I think he's also making the military angry at him
 I mean I've heard stories now where the where the the military is running around 
 and they're sort of getting restless 
 and a restless military is the kind of thing that happens you know 
 like with the Baltic states when they just go in there 
 divvy the people up
 Uh-huh
 That's interesting 
 I I wonder 
 I don't know if he's 
 he he seems 
 the thing about Gorbachev strikes that he wouldn't be that dumb 
 I don't know though
 That's that that's something that really true 
 sort of a military thing I was speaking of before
 That's that's certainly true 
 I mean his military may just go out and say Well we just 
 Gorbachev said you can't do it 
 and we're to not let you do it you know 
 So 
 Yeah 
 that that's real scary actually
 I mean I I I would expect their own problems would keep them away from us for a while 
 but it could be real dangerous
 Yeah 
 right 
 we don't need to worry about them
 Yeah 
 but wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else
 Yeah
 Well I don't I don't know 
 I think that un- underlying we're all pretty probably not as as different as everybody thinks
 Right 
 Well that's that's certainly true of it
 That's true 
 I was I was discussing with someone before 
 this someone before actually one of these calls 
 matter of fact about another topic 
 but it came up 
 one of these calls 
 matter of fact about another topic 
 but it came up 
 one of these this this poem Everything I Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten or something 
 You've read that one before
 That this this is the idea that [ [ [ I think is actually very ] + is ] + is what I think ] we should all revert to 
 The idea that 
 basically they said everything happened in kindergarten 
 and in kindergarten we learned to share 
 and we learned to play with each other [ 
 we learned to take nap + and to take naps ] 
 and whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other you know 
 and that would be all 
 If we could just do the same thing sort of with with with everybody else I suspect we'd we'd be fine
 Yeah 
 unfortunately
 Because I often I often sort of wonder how having never been to the Soviet Union how different the people there really are you know 
 How much 
 Yeah
 Right
 I would I would love to go there I mean like again not now but at some point to go see what what this is like 
 I mean this this is amazing because this is this is an this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us 
 Like you said before 
 so it would be interesting to watch
 Yeah 
 that's that's 
 and the ones I even feel somewhat worse for even 
 the ones in like the Baltic states where they don't have a strong leader then you know 
 at least at least Russia has some sort of strong leader 
 I mean they have Yeltsin who may who may yet sort of help Russia
 But I mean the Baltic states I think are just sort of trapped 
 I mean they were taken over couple you know not too long ago and then just sort of told well you're here now 
 you're part of our country 
 You be this way 
 It's a I think it's a sad state of affairs 
 but 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 well yeah 
 and that 
 actually it sounds very I mean very similar 
 They're sort of being they were sort of forced 
 and now they just want to sort of speak up and say Hey 
 we want our piece
 And they have like a problem 
 they have Muslims to deal with as well as Saddam Hussein 
 I I mean I think their big problem up there is you know unfortunately 
 not only are they vic- 
 there's more than one group fighting for the same place 
 They all want the you know 
 whereas the Baltics are saying we want our own 
 We just want this little tiny piece of land
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 yes
 Uh-huh 
 actually my wife is Syrian 
 so I I also I know some of the history 
 And actually the other funny thing is that I'm I'm Jewish 
 We're sort of like the Middle East peace talks ourselves
 So we I I know 
 I've been to Israel 
 and I know 
 and I sort of toured the area 
 and I know that it really is very lots of different cultures in one place I mean
 and it's the same thing I thi- it's it's almost the same thing out out in the Soviet Union right now 
 There you know there are 
 you can't take a whole bunch of people who just aren't the same people and don't want to be together and put them together forcibly
 I mean we did it couple of hundred years ago here 
 but they wanted to do it 
 So 
 That's that's certainly true
 Right 
 I wonder I wonder if now the people in the Soviet Union don't have ideas very different from that
