 Do you have children
 Oh
 I have one that's a freshman in high school a daughter And a son who's a sixth grader in a middle school
 And I spend most of my time carpooling 
 The story of my life 
 My kids are involved in sports 
 My daughter has played basketball for six years 
 and my son plays football 
 I 
 my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere 
 Yes
 I know
 I know 
 The insurance
 Yes 
 My son is in both band and scouts too
 gee
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 We found this Oriental tile game called Mah-jongg 
 Have you
 Well it's really fun 
 one of my neighbors moved here from Memphis 
 and a lot of them played it 
 and she started a group going in the neighborhood 
 and my kids wanted to learn how to play it 
 and it's more fun with four people
 And it's a game that none of their friends know how to play 
 and they both enjoy it 
 So if they want to play they have to play with mom and dad
 So we play that a lot of them 
 and we like to go miniature golfing and to movies
 We have family that lives outside of the state 
 so we go visit both sets of grandparents and and take car trips
 So that 
 and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly
 My daughter and and I hate camping so we go shopping
 So that just kind of works out real well
 And I'm a writer by profession 
 and my daughter enjoys writing too 
 so a lot of times she and I will travel to writers conferences together
 Yeah 
 So *[[slash error]] Yeah
 So that gives us special time together too 
 And she's on the yearbook staff and things like that 
 so I can help her with that 
 and she gives me ideas for my writing too 
 so 
 Yep 
 Yeah
 Right
 My husband has taken us to work with him 
 and we still don't know what he does
 So we just say he travels a lot 
 So that kind of covers it
 Yes
 Yeah
 He's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months
 Yes
 So those are the real killers 
 If he's just gone 
 he's gone three weeks right now 
 and that's that's mild compare to the big ones
 so we just you know I just do the carpooling and and handle whatever needs to be done 
 And something major always needs to be done
 So you just have to to handle it until he gets home 
 And hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home
