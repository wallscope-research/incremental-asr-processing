 no 
 I don't watch much T V 
 Sometimes usually the reason I will turn it on is to hear the news
 But I don't think of that every day even 
 I think I get most of my current events 
 well I get them from everywhere 
 I sometimes watch T V if I 
 I guess I watch T V if I haven't read the paper that day 
 We don't get a paper 
 but I work at a 
 I teach a college class 
 and 
 there's a 
 the library has a paper 
 And so I often drop in on a break and and read it 
 And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I'm home
 And then I I figure if there's big big news I'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or someone else you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 what's your favorite news 
 do you get a news magazine 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we've got 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 exactly
 Are you satisfied with the quality of coverage
 Yeah 
 it's kind of hard to know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well I do feel like a little bit like 
 being from California and wanting to hear like 
 I've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something 
 and 
 I don't ever hear it in the news here
 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 I sometimes feel like the Dallas paper and the DALLAS NEWS the top headlines are always a murder you know
 That that's because there's a high crime rate 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I'm sure
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 really
 That's true 
 We certainly get enough coverage 
 I mean we we can get news 
 you know I mean there's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty-four hours a day
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 often times 
 So Yeah
 Well no 
 I guess we can end
 Yeah 
 it's just whenever we're 
 Yeah 
 Have you always gone until the recording
 Uh-huh 
 I guess we're not supposed to 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Interesting 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well I guess I can just say I it bothers me that I hear a lot about you know on the news that 
 well it seems like I don't know some things are sensationalized or some things are 
 you know you'll hear one report 
 and then you'll hear that it you know they didn't
