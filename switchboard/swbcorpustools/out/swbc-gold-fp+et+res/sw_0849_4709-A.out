 Okay 
 What would you rather have 
 Or you want salary too plus what 
 What's most important to you 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well I'll tell you 
 I think that is the most important thing 
 I've I'm not working right at the moment 
 but the company that I did work for 
 excuse me <> I had health benefits You know dental vision all that pension plan 
 now I don't have that although I do have a pension that I'm drawing from them which thank God I had
 But man I think those medical benefits are the most important 
 Right 
 I should knock on wood 
 I haven't you know had any serious health problems or anything 
 I've only probably been to the doctor a couple of times since I left work 
 and it was only for a cold you know 
 and they can't really do anything for you anyhow 
 so you might as well not even go 
 Yeah 
 right 
 you've got a cold 
 Go home and take liquids and rest
 But 
 that is definitely the most important 
 pension I guess is next 
 thank God that I had one 
 I don't know what happened to the salary employees when the company went bankrupt 
 <> but I was union 
 so mine was being put into a like a trust fund you know
 So but I don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs 
 or 
 Yeah 
 that's what I was thinking too 
 I really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there you know
 So where 
 what company do you work for
 uh-huh
 No
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I I worked for a trucking company P I E nation wide 
 You probably heard of that 
 does she really
 how about that
 Well you did
 Well Ryder and P I E went together you know 
 and then then that ended it 
 It really did 
 It's it started I think a little bit before that 
 but that 
 when P I E and and Ryder went together why that was downhill from then on you know 
 Right
 Right 
 Yes 
 it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits 
 We could do that for eighteen months
 But three hundred and fifty dollars a month 
 God that's terrible You know 
 So but anyhow and jobs aren't that hard to find to get another one that does pay your benefits you know
 And a lot of them that 
 if you do get a job they don't pay benefits
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 right 
 <> But you know what's happening is the disability plan you know 
 so many people are lying about their things 
 God there's been big articles in the paper about that 
 you know they claim a back injury 
 and then someone goes out and spies on them 
 and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and and everything else you know 
 So I don't know what's happening and what's going to happen 
 But
