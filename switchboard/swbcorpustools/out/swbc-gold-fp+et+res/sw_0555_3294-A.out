 So what So what gets you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I mean I 
 that's exactly the kind of thing I would have said 
 Although in my case it's my wife and I both work 
 we come home 
 and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings 
 and it's one solicitation call after another 
 and you know 
 Yeah 
 it's it's like you say very annoying 
 and why why do we let this happen
 Would would you 
 I mean if you could legislate something what would you legislate
 Yeah
 It it seems it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't want to receive calls like that
 *[[sv]] And the people making these calls would be obliged to c- compare the their lists that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to be called
 
 And that that way those who want it can have it 
 and those who don't want it don't have to have it
 Sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself
 Except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers automatically 
 and 
 Right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah <>
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 And these and these people may in fact be just looking to s- find an unoccupied house to rob
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 What about these telephone callers Sometimes they're door-to-door but usually they're telephone callers who who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire
 *[[two utts]] Well I think these people were hired by from from different sources
 with you know 
 and so therefore there's no one answer 
 But but yeah 
 sometimes it's a market sur- basically it's a market survey 
 but they never say who who they're really working for or what you know what + what what questions are you know 
 Yeah <>
 Yeah
 Yeah <>
 Yeah <>
 Right 
 well and sometimes that's this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too 
 Other times it's you know wasting your time to collect the data they want for their marketing purpose 
 For which if they would just pay me enough money I would be willing to consider
 But but a dollar isn't it 
 you know it's 
 and I also sort of worry that you know that sometimes people giveaway personal information 
 when when the call comes and and they you know sort of seductive to you know 
 somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things 
 and so I start answering 
 and then you you know you go down a path
 and you don't know where it's going to end
 *[[slash error]] In fact you don't even know what you've eventually you know the totality of what you've revealed 
 *[[sv]] and you know *[[slash error]] This isn't you know prob- most likely not to going to be used against you 
 but it could 
 and And that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed Because it's subject to abuse 
 and it
