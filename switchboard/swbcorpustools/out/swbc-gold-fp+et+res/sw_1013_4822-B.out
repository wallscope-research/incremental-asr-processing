 Well a friend of mine actually works for McDonald Douglas in the in the space station program 
 so I get to find out a lot of information about what's going on there 
 and it sure sounds like that's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels
 they're they're going to be doing a lot of interesting things 
 I think one of the big things he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads 
 And that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can't do down here on earth including some new pharmaceutical techniques
 So you know there's there's a big opportunity for us to explore what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment
 So I suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that
 Right
 Well as far as the practical aspects go I suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise between you know deep space + <> I'm sorry deep space exploration and and not doing anything because we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station
 And you know perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that we'd normally do down here that are damaging to the environment
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Right
