 no 
 I think that maybe the the automation people that are very discrete Or not discrete electronic devices
 So and did he i- is he the one that got you connected with us
 Okay 
 It's a lot of fun
 You want to punch the button and go
 Yip 
 Well are you going to buy a car soon
 And what are you going to buy
 Well have you been listening to Iacocca's arguments that that Chrysler products are the only ones that that all have air bags
 Does that make a difference to you
 Yeah 
 like what
 Yeah
 That's 
 Di- did you see the 
 I don't know if it was TWENTY-TWENTY last Thursday or Friday night on on seat belts
 Did that scare you a little bit With the lady being thrown out and run over
 that really sc- 
 I I guess I 
 that that a little more than scared me 
 that irritated me 
 that 
 because it it it surely didn't come as a surprise that that if the door came open the lady would fall out 
 I mean and 
 
 no 
 probably well 
 I might 
 the problem is I'm really into cars 
 and so it's not a 
 for me it's it's a real it's a real consideration 
 and and the 
 but no 
 I probably wouldn't have even though I'm really quite into cars 
 it's it's probably my main hobby
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 yeah 
 you know ROAD AND TRACK had a had some articles on 
 and particularly with with back seat with some where kids were were sitting in the back seat with seat belts on 
 and they were thrown forward into the front seat 
 and there was enough stretching the combination of stretching the spine to par- I mean the serious injury even though they were they were still locked in the 
 they were forced to go 
 so really if your sitting in the back seat your better off not not to have your seat belt on if it's just a seat belt
 We have a van that just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness
 I have an Arrow Star van 
 we really do 
 it's it's a mini van 
 we've had it 
 goodness in May will be five years 
 and they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty 
 And the transmission was replaced 
 but they really are nifty 
 the mini van it's 
 actually we had a station wagon before 
 and it's a foot or two shorter than a 
 we had a regular size station wagon
 and it really 
 we like it 
 it the 
 interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well but the 
 did you did you go to Florida in a van
 Yeah
 Yeah
 What what kind was it
 What what was remarkable this van even with the 
 we have two kids 
 and we went to Disney World
 actually I grew up in Alabama 
 and I went to see my mother 
 and then went on down to Disney World 
 and it got better than I think twenty-two twenty-three miles a gallon 
 And this was with the air conditioner on and and you know four people with with luggage 
 and course this 
 grant it 
 that's you know it's been four years ago 
 but it's remarkable that the that the bigger vans they're 
 my boss just bought a a pick up truck 
 and he only gets seventeen miles a gallon
 But it it has a big engine 
 and it it pulls a boat and stuff 
 but it's and it it's got the seats 
 that and the other thing that is interesting is it has rear air conditioning
 And that that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates
 Well the big you know the big vans are all real nice 
 yeah 
 those are
 yeah
 Yeah
 All right
 Uh-huh
 Well well the mini that 
 you'd be surprised if if you drive a one of the the mini vans 
 more or less alike the the Chevrolet 
 and well of course Oldsmobile has got one 
 and Chryslers got one 
 but they drive remarkably like cars
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 but the little thing etched in it 
 say objects are are closer than they appear or something 
 Yeah
 Well you you can you can install those mirrors 
 we've got the big side mirrors which are really nice 
 I don't know if you've well if you've driven a pick up truck you know 
 these are these mirrors must be six inches across not nearly a foot high
 and they're really nice 
 got them on both sides 
 actually they they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back
 But they're 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well they have got some of the newer ones they you know with the aerodynamic features 
 you can get pretty pretty decent gas mileage
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Ford now announced I think in ninety-two they're going to put air bags in their in their vans
 So and I think I I believe safety 
 I I I I really do believe in this stuff 
 and I I think it can go 
 I'm not 
 the air bags are a good deal 
 but surprisingly they're 
 you really need to do 
 you need a combination of both the air bags and the and the seat belts 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It would be that would do to our insurance rates you know if if if the insurance companies says it says we're not going to pay you know a claim if if the car doesn't have air bags 
 Would be interesting wouldn't it
 that wouldn't be fair 
 but 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 I've got to go 
 my son's in a performance tonight 
 I have to leave in a couple of minutes 
 I think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time
 It was good talking to you
 Okay 
 Good night
