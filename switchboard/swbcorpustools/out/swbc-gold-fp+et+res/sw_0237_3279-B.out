 I think that would probably be very possible
 and and we really wouldn't feel it in our services 
 Yes 
 I have
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 Well I 
 one one thing that really bothers me beyond beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes 
 and the regular normal taxpayers are you know paying such a large proportion of of our personal income 
 and then the corporate you know industries just don't seem to not pay proportionally
 I think that that would would help a lot 
 I guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things 
 but I don't know It's just hard to hard to take and you know see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use
 And seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from from that direction 
 But 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Not not going to help
 It's nev- never helped my my personal situation 
 I I can't say it would help with theirs either 
 Amen 
 It seems seems to be 
 I you know I 
 it really does bother me when I think about you know leaving our children with with this sort of a national problem that we can't seem to find an an answer to it 
 I don't know
 Right
 Yeah
 Well that's that's quite possible 
 I guess we have to have to keep plugging away a little bit 
 or it will just totally get even more out of control 
 but I I don't know
 Yeah 
 I I do
 She's a 
 we're not feeling too well over here 
 so that 
 Yeah
 No 
 no 
 She's 
 I don't think I could part with her
 Okay
 Okay 
 well thanks
 Bye-bye
