 Yes
 I I 
 Yeah 
 I I suspect the apathy is due to something like people just feeling that that their vote doesn't count anyway 
 I mean why why bother voting if if your vote won't make a difference 
 So for instance in the last presidential election I'm sure a lot of people thought Bush is going to win either way 
 why bother voting
 That's right 
 I think that's 
 and and the other side of the coin is people saying well if I really like the underdog candidate I still think they're not going to win 
 so are only the same two caucuses certainly not going to win why bother voting for him 
 So I thi- I think that's a big a big a big reason for it 
 How abou- 
 that's true 
 Actually I never thought about that 
 that that's a good rea- 
 That's true 
 that's true
 Uh-huh
 I think on the local elections it's actually 
 I think I think people vote in the larger elections because they feel like well you know the country's real important 
 and you know if I if we help elect a president who's going to save us then then the whole country will be saved 
 But they figure local elections don't mean that much I suspect 
 So people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know and I think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like that 
 So people think that that that they don't have that that it doesn't matter as much whereas I think it's probably just the opposite is true 
 I think it's probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level
 
 Right
 
 Right 
 but 
 Yeah 
 that's that's possible 
 I still think that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference though as well 
 I think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me I'm just a little nobody 
 My vote's not going to count anyway 
 You know and I think that's probably a portion of the population that massively under represent- 
 I I I would guess that that portion of the population is massively under represented
 
 What do they have to do with one another
 so they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever
 I didn't realize that actually 
 That 
 Yeah 
 there is 
 There are much easier ways to get out of jury duty
 Just go in and say I want to be a juror 
 I can spot a guilty person a mile away
 Well that that just seems to be a person who just doesn't care about much of anything around sort of you know doesn't doesn't sort of likes rights probably but doesn't like respon- responsibilities 
 I mean that's what it boils down to is people like to people say I don't want to be on jury you know 
 I don't want to serve on jury duty 
 I don't want to vote 
 I don't want to do this and that 
 Well then they could you know put them in the reverse situation in the place where they don't have the right to be on jury duty 
 and they don't have the right to vote
 I suspect their opinions would change very quickly
 Yes
 Yes 
 they were they were doing that 
 Unfortunately what what they they had no idea what they were voting on it turns out
 That's right 
 But but it's the thought they all got out 
 But you wonder if you know if if now the next election they have if only half of them are going to show up 
 Or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in Russia
 Right 
 That's that's true
 Right
 Now if things go the way that that that they are there I think that they'll keep voting 
 but I think they'll wind up like us at some point where people sort of only half of them will end up voting and sort of caring enough to really make a statement 
 so You know I think I think that that the people who most need to vote sometimes are the are the ones who who are really out to make a statement because you know when when when you've got an underdog candidate who represents something and even if he doesn't win a large number of people voting for that particular candidate does I think make a statement to everyone else
 Yeah 
 I think 
 and I think that's real important
 That's probably true
 
 That's good 
 that's actually really good 
 Well act- act- 
 actually the female who I would most rally behind right now right I don't know much about her politics by the way the way she makes speeches is a local person for you is Ann Richards
 I don't know her politics 
 I just know that I saw her speak in the eighty-four Democratic convention 
 And right then and there if they said to me vote for someone for president I would have slapped down my vote for Ann Richards
 That's very good
 That's that's that's that's very good 
 That's 
 I I like that 
 So I would I would vote for her 
 and I suspect she could get a large voter turnout
 Say I I I would think that that that people like that 
 I think in- inflammatory politicians are 
 or or emotional politicians certain very vibrant politicians tend to bring crowds out I think 
 I would hope
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I've heard of it 
 but not necessarily the 
 I've heard it's very controversial though
 Uh-huh
 
 Yes That's what 
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh 
 Well they were elected as well 
 so So So they're going to be 
 That's true 
 that's true 
 Well Well in some sense they should be politicians in that you know you want them to respect the people 
 and you don't want them to have you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge
 But on the other hand 
 Right
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 So how do you think we can get people to vote 
 I've had one idea that I think is is is completely undoable 
 but but I think 
 but I suspect it would work 
 And the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate who you never expect to win to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements so that a large population of of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else
 So given a choice between you know 
 so that 
 so if you have 
 so if if 
 imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes you know anti you know sort of anti women statements anti semitic statements anti black statements et cetera et cetera 
 well then I suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just just to spite that person 
 But I don't think that that would actually ever work
 Uh-huh
 That's an interesting notion
 That that that that would be interesting 
 yes 
 I think that would work in some places 
 yeah
