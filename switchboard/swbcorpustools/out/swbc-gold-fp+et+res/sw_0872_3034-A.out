 Okay 
 I hope you know more about the subject of baseball 
 and where they're going than I do beca- 
 Well I 
 of all the sports that there are that there is I like baseball the best 
 However I haven't been to a baseball game in years 
 but I have kept my eye on the Rangers
 You know 
 and I guess they were doing pretty good up to a point 
 and then they kind of fell on their face 
 Correct 
 right 
 They've got a one man show going there Which is interesting you know 
 I guess he can I guess he can really call down a salary 
 They're so astronomical I can't even imagine that kind of money 
 You know it's just phenomenal 
 Well good
 I understand 
 I understand
 Okay 
 you are involved with T Is speech recognition
 How did you find out about it
 okay
 I see
 Interesting
 great
 I see
 Uh-huh
 Well that's good 
 Well that's interesting 
 And the topics are interesting 
 they run a whole gamut of of subjects 
 and I think we can address every topic 
 but the depth of knowledge is quite different
 So when they chose baseball 
 I mean I'm I'm I can understand baseball you know 
 I don't understand football
 you know it's such a rugged game that it it seems to be too physical for my interest Uh-huh
 Well I I can relate to baseball because I used to play baseball 
 But I can't relate to football because I've never played football and and don't and have any interest 
 and I said if I ever had a son he would not play football 
 And I had four daughters 
 so that wasn't a question 
 but now I have a grandson that i- you know is gung ho for football
 And that doesn't please Grandma too much I'm always af- because the injuries are can be very very devastating
 I understand that
 but I think the they happen more in football 
 I think the odds are cut down
 You know I I know they can get hurt in baseball too 
 The bat is a very heavy object can do a lot of damage 
 but I think that they have a a lower racial of injuries ratio of injuries in baseball
 Because the- 
 Yeah
 A love for them
 Uh-huh
 I see
 Uh-huh
 Did you did you sustain any permanent injury with that
 Oh 
 okay
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 boy
 Uh-huh 
 Well I have I have a broken arm that I had since I was three 
 It was never set right
 And I liked bowling as a as a kind of a relaxing sport 
 And one of the men that was in our rel- on our league noticed you know my broken arm and the way my ball would do 
 And he says let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage 
 And so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen I had my high game of two eighty-seven
 So yeah 
 it was really funny you know that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and and how to follow through with my 
 addressing that to put the ball 
 the pins 
 So that was interesting 
 So I really I got a lot of recognition from the the bowling league I guess
 I'm not sure where all my pins came from 
 but it's 
 but that was quite awhile ago 
 but I and I never pursued it 
 And a lot of people said well you should have turned pro 
 And I thought no 
 not m- 
 m- 
 I don't 
 my love wasn't there for the game 
 I liked to as a as a method of entertainment and I fellowship 
 but outside of that no 
 I didn't 
 And I and I still I like to bowl 
 but I don't have Jack standing behind me to tell me what to do 
 No 
 I'm not
 No 
 No {F uh 
 } at T I they have a sponsor a junior league achievement 
 and it's true bowling 
 and I've never shared that with them 
 I would have to brush up on my bowling before I even tried to win a lot of money for the junior achievement organization 
 But that's the only thing that I would you know be to do
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Still carries a good lim- average
