 yeah 
 yeah
 well out of control I don't know 
 I guess it could be worse 
 we've we've we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood 
 I live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington 
 there's there's a lot of problems 
 I mean there's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people 
 and you know we get c- cars on our block regularly g- gone through rifled through and stuff
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you figured it was like Omaha right
 No 
 it's it's not Newark 
 but yeah 
 it's got problems
 Yeah 
 I think most people regard it as a warehouse Where you put away the people that are so bad that you don't want them out in circulation
 Yeah
 That's what I hear
 Yeah 
 I I think you know 
 don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea
 Yeah
 you mean she taught in a prison
 Oh
 I see
 
 Yeah 
 the b- the bureaucracy 
 
 Yeah
 So she didn't feel safe
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 right
 Well at least it's maximum security right 
 well I I think the people that run yeah that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical you know
 I mean I you know I I talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff 
 and it's 
 you can get pretty hardened I'm sure
 Yeah 
 right
 Those are funny labels see 
 yeah
 yeah 
 absolutely 
 I think yeah I think you can blame it on social problems 
 Sure
 I mean as as you know as poverty has gotten worse as you know education has gotten worse as there's been more single parent families as there's been more homelessness there's m- been more crime
 Yeah 
 there's not enough beds and treatment programs rising drug abuse 
 and yep 
 it's a mess
 Is he the guy wants to like deregulate heroin or something
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
