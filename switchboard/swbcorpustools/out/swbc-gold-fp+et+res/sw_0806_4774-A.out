 Been on the line for awhile 
 I almost forgot what the topic was
 but I know what it is
 let me see 
 I I I I I'm kind of 
 I don't 
 you know I'm I'm kind of in the middle 
 I I think it's a great idea
 but when it comes to me it's like almost an insult you know 
 so it's 
 I I've come from the teaching field
 So so it's just like I don't know I I guess I guess I'd have to go with 
 I I I'd be for it You know 
 But you know I I I don't know It's just kind of a kind of a delicate subject I guess 
 But I I I would I would probably go for for going ahead and doing it you know If it's got to be done for everyone
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 You kind of goes into your privacy 
 and you know but I guess if they 
 you know you know there's 
 I guess there's some companies that aren't that are doing it
 And it it seems to be working out 
 so 
 Yeah
 Right
 See that's hard
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Then I kind of hear it goes into like 
 this is just something I've heard that it kind of goes into like just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold That it kind of affects that too
 I didn't know that
 
 Yeah 
 See things like that 
 so 
 Yeah
 Right 
 right 
 Uh-huh 
 See that's 
 Yeah 
 That's where I kind of get into 
 cause it kind of gets into your personal life you know 
 And wha- what's kind of next
 The what
 Huh
 Oh
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 Right
 So do you think they'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually 
 I kind of think they will
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 We haven't either 
 Yeah 
 But I I I just kind of think it's heading that way though you know It's just because it's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff 
 and I just I just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way
 Yeah 
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
