 mainly the the books I read are business related or self improvement 
 I've got a a small company on the side that I that I do things with 
 so a lot of the reading that I I do has to do with how can I do better at at my small-time business important issues such as a you know taxes and business expenses and all those kind things
 I've got a small distributorship 
 I sell a healthy cookie on the side
 And I have a few health food stores that I send it to 
 I can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can
 so I can get a deal from the from the ma- from the supplier
 and then I distributed them 
 and then I ca- I get I can sell them at a cheaper price 
 Plus I've got a drinking water system business that I've had on the side for years that I've done 
 A drinking water business 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sounds like it
 I haven't really read anything like that in in in years 
 There was a time when I was really into the home things
 and I did had my own garden
 and I did canning all those kind of things 
 That was when I was about ten years younger 
 and I had 
 About ten years younger 
 yeah
 And th- the problem that I've had in the past with my children growing up and moving out of the house and and still having three left at home out of the five 
 I've tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in in reading more and and spending more time at the library 
 and it 
 I've been moderately successful with my daughter and with my son they both have different interests in books 
 but they they they do read them 
 I have some books on on health that I read all the time 
 One's on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing
 Yeah 
 I I'm Uh-huh
 There's a a couple called 
 I'm going to forgot his name now Dirkson *[[forgot = forget]]
 and there's a book called LIFE EXTENSIONS 
 I don't know if you've ever heard of it
 Okay 
 It's a book called LIFE EXTENSIONS 
 There's also a book called THE LIFE EXTANS- EXTENSION COMPANION
 Dirk Pearson and 
 I forgot Sally's last name anyway it's a couple 
 I've I've seen them on T V 
 and they an- they are pretty down to earth about what you can take and and what you can't take 
 and The quantities what are good for you what isn't
 and 
 LIFE EXTENSIONS
 yeah 
 he's probably about forty years old now
 I saw him probably seven years ago on Johnny Carson show
 and I was pretty impressed 
 He had a 
 he 
 before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs you know based on how well it was performing
 and then he embarked on this vitamin treatment 
 and then every year he had the same tests run
 and at the age of thirty-two I think it was his heart was that of a fourteen year old
 and all the rest of his organs were all greatly you know all tested out greatly below his actual age
 And of course Sally isn't a very big woman
 I mean she's you know she appeared to me to be very petite 
 and she took a horse shoe and and turned it turned it into an S
 and it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that that give you the strength
 and of course doing Isometric exercises together they both exercised about five minutes a day doing Isometrics rather than you know physical strenuous exercises
 Uh-huh

 there's 
 I've I've read a lot of things since I got involved in the water business back in eighty-three
 and it's amazing that the the legislation they have for food that doesn't apply to water
 they don't consider water a food
 and the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be you know they wouldn't be able to sell it to you through your pipes because it's toxic chlorine
 It's toxic 
 It's a 
 I don't know if your on city water 
 city water has chlorine in it 
 chlorine causes cancer
 they know that 
 they've proven that 
 yet their saying well we're putting such low doses in there that well you don't have to worry about dying from it 
 The problem is that I've that I've read books that have proven that there is a link between the ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis which is heart attack
 and if you look at the history of hear attacks heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty
 *[[typo hear> heart]] and we started doing large quantities of chlorination of water starting around where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water/
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'm very familiar with the area
 It depends a lot of a lot of things were thought that as 
 you know the farmers thought okay we got chemicals we're putting chemicals on the field 
 well the ground will naturally filter out the <>
