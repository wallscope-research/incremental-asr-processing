 I spent four years as a university professor
 And 
 Yeah
 do you really
 That's great
 No kidding 
 W- 
 I did
 I did 
 Well I was pretty young 
 I was 
 I had never intended to do it 
 and I was given the opportunity after I'd started a management consulting firm to teach in in one of the business schools in the California State University system
 At any rate the topic is fascinating because one of the things I've done for the past few years is research the problem from the point of view of what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically
 You may be familiar with cooperative learning 
 Have you ever 
 Well the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools 
 And what what it involves basically is the use of peer groups 
 and the teacher becomes a a sort of a consultant resource person to the cooperative learning to the learning cooperatives I guess they're called 
 And there are some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people gain a competence with respect to the material
 I think that the combination of technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn 
 I think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster 
 school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators
 and both teachers and parents complain about the the cost and ineffectiveness that results 
 So my feeling is that the the problem is is significant 
 There are plenty of good people available to offer people educational experience 
 but that we just have to re- reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it 
 and I think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly accelerate the the pace of learning
 And my feeling is that those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually 
 I don't know what form it will ultimately take 
 but I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior 
 so it must be the way we're managing the process that 
 I I don't I don't think it's it's a matter of of talented people to do it a- both as quote unquote students and as teachers 
 but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities in the past thirty years that weren't existent 
 you must see kids with real significant problems in some cases 
 course I always see the 
 I don't know how hard how hard is it in the public school system in Iowa City 
 Is it is it deteriorated a lot 
 Do the people say 
 are they pretty happy with it 
 or 
 Right
 Even in Utah 
 Well Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe
 Yeah 
 you so you saw a fair number of troubled kids
 Yeah
 Yeah
