 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 That's true 
 Very definitely so
 Uh-huh
 No 
 Very immature in that respect
 I agree 
 I think that for so long power financially uh governmentally every which way was in the hands of such a few that there's not the middle class that we we perceive
 Are extremely poor 
 That's correct
 Uh-huh 
 And and just very happy to get that
 I have a brother who spent two years in Bolivia
 And this is very much his you know reaction that the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Oh gosh 
 Yep 
 Intentions intentions 
 I know 
 Uh I have a sister-in-law who is from Nicaragua 
 and her family 
 her father was a fairly uh high ranking official under Somoza 
 And when that went down the tubes they had to get out
 And seventeen children filtered through into into America through Guatamala through Mexico through Honduras 
 you know two here three there one here you know this kind of thing until 
 and now uh couple of the older ones stayed or went back 
 but the rest of them now have their American citizenship and are leading productive lives
 but you kn- 
 Yes 
 Yes
 Oh the stories she tells you know are just unnerving just unnerving
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 And the uranium
 The technology
 Well 
 and you know they're very willing to be taught in many cases now too 
 but you know there's just always this kind of resentment underlying 
 I think that when they receive help from us they want it 
 but they don't want it I mean 
 It's kind of a catch twenty-two
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well 
 and I think that you know it 
 somewhat a sarcastic view 
 but some of those drugs czars you know 
 they they know that by pumping that poison into our system that that's the way to bring us to our knees more on their level
 You know that's really uh kind of a far fetched idea 
 I know 
 and I don't think people probably think those things consciously
 but it's like in any sibling rivalry 
 we're hearing the same
 In the long run
 And in the short run probably too
 Course then could you know at at some point could you ever convince someone to turn around and grow something that was productive for humankind
 You know
 I mean even their even their legal crops are things that we don't perceive as being healthy now from a medical standpoint of view coffee tobacco you know 
 They're certainly legal 
 but they're certainly not healthy
 No 
 not that I know of 
 But it's been fun hashing about it I suppose 
 At any rate 
 yeah
 Well let's just hope that the powers that be uh have time to a little bit once in a while to to think in some farther reaching avenues than you and I do here tonight 
 but 
 Well it's been nice chatting with you
 I appreciate it 
 and and tell your wife I hope we I get her again sometime too 
 This is fun
 It's kind of nice to to see old friends now you see
 Bye now
