 Okay 
 well let me go ahead and press one 
 Okay Leslie 
 I'd like to find out a little bit about your hobbies 
 What do you like to do in your spare time
 Actually it's a cherished commodity now days 
 great
 Uh-huh
 What kind of music
 okay
 Well great 
 I enjoy music too 
 and I 
 one thing that I like to do is sit down and play the piano 
 I can't play that well 
 but I sit down and enjoy playing musical selections that I am familiar with My fam- my family is familiar with 
 I enjoy that
 a couple of hobbies that I also have is 
 I really enjoy bike riding 
 and the biggest hobbies I have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in
 Like my oldest boy is involved in soccer 
 so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football 
 and we also like to ride bicycles 
 So we're riding bicycles 
 and so a lot of the hobbies that I have right now are centered around my my children and also things that my wife and I like to do together 
 And so personally a lot of the hobbies I had when I was growing up and going to college and so forth are having to change
 I really enjoyed mountain climbing 
 I really enjoyed skiing and a lot of outdoor activities 
 there's not a whole lot of mountains here in Texas that I can go skiing with that right now 
 but hopefully I will be able to get back to the slopes some day 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 You didn't
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 That's true
 yeah 
 I guess that for me it was very helpful 
 My two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing
 And so we we went quite often 
 and in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing 
 When I lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago 
 and we would go skiing and enjoy that
 So but luckily it's kind of unusual because hobbies it's a it's a nice thing to have 
 and it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to Like you mentioned 
 and I am finding out a lot of the spare time that I had isn't there
 It's it's taken up by activities with work with family with civic and Church responsibilities for me
 So
