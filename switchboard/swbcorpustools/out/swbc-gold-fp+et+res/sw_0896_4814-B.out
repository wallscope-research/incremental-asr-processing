 So interesting political trends or events 
 Well I guess the most interesting one that's going on right now from my perspective is this phenomena of Ross Perot 
 caught his interview last night with David Frost 
 and it was the the first time I had you know heard his views expressed by himself 
 I had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in
 But the whole phenomena of him coming out of literally nowhere and no party at least no apparent party support on either side is pretty interesting
 Uh-huh
 Like out of nowhere 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well it seems that the decision so far has been filtered by you know party politics so much that when the candidates finally get party approval party support and therefore get presented to the public the the candidates are already beyond what most public feels is acceptable behavior
 You know the 
 one of the common criticisms of Clinton is gee he'll say or do anything in order to get to the White House
 And and up and to the point of Perot being a serious candidate it seems like that that was a requirement of being a a contender within the party is to have done all those things
 I mean here's here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward you know getting the party nomination and and preparing himself for the presidency 
 and now it seems like both he and the incumbent President are you know pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of a whole nonpolitical arena 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 And and yet even he was a a consummate politician in the sense that not only did he fail in business twice with bankruptcy and failure 
 but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one
 And the first d- and the first and only election he won was the presidency 
 He he had lost every other office that he had you know 
 he was appointed a couple of times to like state legislator
 Yeah 
 Then then when he finally you know did win an election you know it was the presidency 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 But 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
