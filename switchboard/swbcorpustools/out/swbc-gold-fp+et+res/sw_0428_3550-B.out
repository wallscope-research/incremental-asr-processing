 All right
 Well what kind of car would I want to buy
 I don't know 
 The question is I mean would I want to buy 
 or would I would I probably actually buy 
 May be two different things
 If I had all the money I wanted then that's whole different matter
 No 
 in that case I'd I'd I don't know 
 I I my dream car for years was a was a Porsche Turbo 
 But I don't know if I'd want one of those now
 Of course I would want one if somebody was was given to me 
 But I maybe would buy a B M W or or even a Volvo
 I've got a a Dodge Daytona
 It's actually the first car we ever bought new
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 me too 
 So what car do you drive 
 What is it
 Uh-huh 
 we almost bought one of those 
 Do you like it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 you get a little more control over when when it's doing the things it's doing 
 Yeah 
 what what rental agent did you go to to actually rent to rent those kind of cars
 To what AVIS
 Really
 Huh 
 I guess 
 I see
 Uh-huh
 Right
 You work for a big company then
 T I I see
 Uh-huh 
 but yeah 
 I I I don't know 
 I would probably if I were to buy a car mys- you know with the constraints of real money I probably would would go with something like you know like a Honda Accord
 Maybe it would 
 one thing I I really liked about about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have this seven year warranty
 and it really saved us some big money once
 Yeah 
 they had a whole bunch of things that that sort of broke at the same time 
 and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars 
 and I had to pay twenty five for the 
 Yeah 
 it was
 Well we we bought the extended the the extension and at the time we bought it it was like you know I don't know four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra
 Yeah 
 we did 
 but you know we really debated at the beginning 
 and of course I'm glad I did it
 But we still have we still have like you know coup- three years left on it
 no
 Bumper
 Oh
 Well that was good
 Are you 
 Uh-huh
 if you were if you were going to buy a new car would you buy another another Accord
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 those are nice 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 my sister drives one 
 She drives a I don't know is it Legend
 it's a 
 I'm not certain 
 but she's liked it 
 But I I have I have never had 
 and we 
 in fact what I'm driving right now 
 we bought a we only had one car for a long time 
 and and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth four miles to work and back kind of thing 
 And so I bought a used Yugo just to be a little you know little car that I could care less about
 well it's it's worked
 I mean that's exactly what it is you know 
 it's just a it's a cheap little little car just to go you know run around town in
 and It's actually kind of fun to drive 
 I I 
 you know getting back in the Daytona now I almost don't like it You know
 it's like too too mushy 
 and it you know it's an automatic 
 and 
 it's too 
 the steering 
 you know you feel like you're in a boat or something you know 
 it's kind of 
 Oh
