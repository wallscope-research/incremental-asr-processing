 Well do you have any pets
 Oh
 Oh
 I used to have box turtles um well years ago when I was growing up
 I I really like them
 Oh
 Yes 
 um we have one dog a Bichon Frise 
 Um our friends in Houston bred the dogs 
 I had never heard of them
 they're um they're all white 
 and they're small and um and fluffy 
 they don't shed 
 I guess they're distantly related to a poodle 
 but they're not very well known in this country 
 and they're not um high strung or over bred um
 Ours is uh on the small end 
 and she's about ten pounds 
 and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds
 and they love people um and kids 
 and that was something we were looking for um 
 our our love is Golden Retrievers 
 and that's what we had intended to get in Houston 
 but we had a small yard and a pool 
 and knowing how they love to dig and love the water um and we thought that was kind of a tough climate
 so uh we ended up getting this 
 and uh my son would rather have a Golden Retriever though I think 
 now he wants a a good size dog 
 Oh
 Yeah
 Well they really are um they're really sweet dogs 
 We've uh we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of um the family that had them and and bred them 
 They had five litters of puppies 
 and and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood
 because um 
 It's B I C H O N F R I S E
 Bichon Frise
 Yeah 
 They're uh 
 and they don't shed 
 so they're they're good dogs for people with with allergies 
 and they love people 
 and they're 
 Um no 
 not really 
 Ours um ours barks more than um than some because she spent a lot of time at our friends house 
 We used to swap back and forth dogs 
 they have three dogs 
 They had a Cockapoo and and two Bichons um 
 and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there
 and uh now it's funny 
 She's she's a good watch dog
 and if there's she'll bark that way 
 but she also talks a lot 
 she um has a definite personality 
 and so if we're leaving her she barks at us because she doesn't want to be left Um
 No 
 no 
 and they're um they're very smart dogs 
 The circuses in Europe used to use them um for the acts 
 They uh oh they'll dance on their hind legs each
 um but they're very easy to train
 and 
 Well they range 
 I'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper 
 They run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars I think which I thought was a lot
 Well she's no longer breeding them
 but um because her dogs um the the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter 
 and uh the one male that she used had a tooth problem
 and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem and did them strictly as um pets you know they weren't weren't show quality
 Ri- 
 Oh but yeah takes a lot of time
 Yeah 
 um but she might have some contacts here 
 I know origina- I know that the dog's grandmother um was from Plano
 Oh that's where I live too
