 Recently graduated from high school Meaning like uh you know three or four years ago 
 I'm a senior in in uh college now
 And uh I can't really talk too much about the problems with uh public education in detail because the school system I went to was uh really superb even though it was a public school system
 Oh 
 Okay
 Yeah
 I got a friend who goes there by the way 
 I want to as- talk to you about that afterward 
 okay 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It was a a it's a more or less a suburban school system
 Yes 
 That that was true for mine too 
 Uh although I I'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity
 but I don't think I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it 
 You know I think that uh I know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education 
 And uh you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn 
 I 
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 But but uh I think even more than that even if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know Which it it sounds like uh 
 now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because uh they have of these uh sort of mandatory <>tory tests if you have to take before you get a diploma 
 But uh but uh certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read 
 Uh and that's just sort of inexcusable 
 and you can't really 
 I just can't even picture how that could happen You know except maybe to someone whose you know really badly learning uh disabled or something 
 But these people obviously weren't
 <> Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 And I think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably 
 I don't I think you know people just 
 Yeah 
 And again I don't 
 they got to know the you know how qualified 
 I think it'd be interesting to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school Uh you know sort sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school You know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like
 I think that'd be an interesting experience 
 But uh I haven't done that 
 But I do I do think that uh public education in general I think can work 
 And I think it's a good thing
 Yeah
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I don't I honestly don't really think I could have you know done much better than I did in the school system I was in 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and and in the 
 once you book junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels 
 Well no 
 I guess it wa- in junior high it was still three 
 Then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects Uh which 
 actually I think that works pretty well 
 and that that makes
