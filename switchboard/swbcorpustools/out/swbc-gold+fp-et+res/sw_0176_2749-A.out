 Well uh I don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the uh jury system do you
 Uh well then you must know a lot more about this than I do 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Well what about the idea that one is only guilty uh when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
 I thought that was the point of uh a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt
 But if there are some people who don't agree uh then there must be it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people
 Really 
 Have you served on a jury
 I never have either 
 but my friends my few friends who have uh say just the opposite 
 They say they're uh remarkably incompetent And uh don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to to air and all that
 Right 
 they don't want anyone with exper- anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system
 And they tend 
 and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it 
 you know it's it's anyone can get out of jury just about 
 and uh so it it's uh it's not really my peers that 
 if I were ar- let's say I were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that uh I would be being tried by a jury of my peers 
 I'd be I'd be tried by a jury of you know people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things 
 and uh I don't know 
 I I get a little bit nervous about it 
 and uh 
 Yeah 
 I I was called once 
 but I was out of the country 
 and apparently I apparently they thought I served 
 so I didn't I didn't make any noise about it 
 I came back 
 and they said the record showed I served 
 but I was out of the country at the time 
 so I'm pretty sure I didn't 
 Uh
 Yeah 
 well I I I don't know 
 I definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous 
 because uh you know there's the classic sort of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where you get you know jury which can have all kinds of prejudices and things that a judge at least officially isn't supposed to have Though of course they can too
 *[[ This last sentence really appears to be an independent slash unit ]] And uh it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much brow- you know browbeat the jury a majority in the of the a majority of the jury 
 that's hard to say 
 Uh so it's it's uh you know saying well look we don't like the way he looks 
 and let's uh let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff
 And you also get a lot of uh juries are extremely uh 
 and from what I hear 
 I I have I have some friends who do expert wis- witness testimony 
 and they say that uh juries are extremely vulnerable to uh sort of emotional pitches you know 
 the prosecutor will want to oh I don't know show the show the mugging victim you know show what the nice person he was and what a family life and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim 
 and uh or or uh if it's a corporation that was uh you know har- harming some individual or something like that they get very much well you know 
 it's just a big faceless corp- corporation 
 Let's let's make them pay as much as possible Things like that 
 So not 
 I'm 
 the problem is I can't guarantee that a judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury 
 but I'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be things like that
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well how about having a j- jury and a judge work together on it somehow 
 I wonder if that's possible 
 I guess the judge's time is worth too much though
 They pay that judge they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge 
 He makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Oh of course 
 It's it's political maneuvering 
 The the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will you know want to hang everyone 
 and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic 
 They're not looking for someone whose going to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror 
 *[[whose> who's]] Neither side wants that 
 They want to find a juror that's going to uh be most persuadable by their arguments you know
 Uh I wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually 
 I know it it it's tricky 
 because I know you know an awful lot of intelligent people who just well 
 I'm too busy to serve on a jury
 so I'll tell them that 
 and they won't just you know just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that you know
 they just say do you believe in such and such
 Uh
 Right 
 Course they'd be they would be barred 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury
 I hope we're called up before too long
 They will they will eventually
 Okay 
 well it was nice talking with you
 Bye-bye
