 Well I guess I stand on uh on probably ten for no uh restrictions 
 I uh recently just moved to Texas from uh South Dakota and Nebraska 
 and I guess in terms of gun control I've always uh been raised with the uh idea in the Constitution that uh citizens had a right to bear arms 
 and I realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded uh more uh of a national defense uh than anything else 
 but uh on the other hand too uh people then uh needed to use firearms for um survival in terms of uh food
 and uh I was raised uh you know hunting all the time 
 I lived on the farm and uh you know enjoy hunting 
 and I guess I have uh some problems with uh being restricted to um owning a gun for you know hunting purposes mainly
 And um it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where um eventually we may not be able to have that right any more
 Yeah 
 it uh moving to this area of course it happens everywhere 
 but uh I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns uh in the midwest and then uh moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings 
 and uh there seems like killing for no reason at all 
 and uh 
 I I think so 
 and and there's always the uh the uh the old uh saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll they'll get one 
 and uh and then uh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's for sure
 Yeah 
 and uh and you know uh I suppose uh years ago way back when uh when uh they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they uh were fed up with the government uh 
 and if they didn't have a way to uh to fight back they would have been in big trouble
 Well the way things are going
 Well you know they introduced some gun control back when I was a teenager I believe in terms of uh every gun you ha- bought had to be licensed I believe
 And uh you know that didn't bother me uh too much 
 and so I guess it depends um if there are some statistics that show that uh that people uh commit crimes on the spur of the moment
