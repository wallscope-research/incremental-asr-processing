 Okay 
 well yes 
 we do have pollution in Houston 
 and it 
 Well it it 
 some 
 I think it depends on uh you know what the ho- the cloud cover 
 and like right now it's uh it's kind of overcast you know 
 just it's hot
 and the sun is trying tries to shine through 
 but it's it's holding in this this pollution 
 and I 
 I think so 
 and uh 
 and we have uh Pasadena Texas which is sort of between here an you know heading toward Galveston 
 I mean it's still part of it's part of the Houston metroplex
 Well I think it's industry 
 and I think it's cars
 I don't I 
 well maybe not 
 but it it sure it sure se- 
 you know it 
 I I know that when I'm when I'm behind a car 
 and uh sometimes uh I can really smell especially diesel and things like that
 you know comes right into my air conditioner 
 and you know my head and my fa- 
 I'm so stopped up right now
 I don't know if it's uh if it's partly from what's blooming you know right now pollen and stuff like that 
 that's part of it 
 but um 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 You mean uh fifty percent pollution total from that comes from 
 Oh uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Do you all have pollution in your co- part of the country uh from industry
 Really
 like what ki- 
 any particular kind or just all kinds
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well what can we do about the the the the air conditioning problem
 Uh-huh
 Is that also what's in uh hairsp- aerosol
 Even so so the aerosol is still aerosol
 but it doesn't have anything that's damaging
 Uh-huh 
 well that's good
 Here they've just started started doing that 
 it's it's you know 
 you're not you don't have to 
 but m- you know 
 I know I am 
 I save 
 No kidding 
 really 
 oh
 Is that right
 Well we need to do something 
 we need to get serious about it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 How much does uh planting more trees and things like that help
 too
 Uh-huh
 I think uh it seems like there was something going on around here that you know 
 we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff
 and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out you know like in the middle of the night they would go ahead and do it anyway 
 I think they got caught
 But I wonder how much of that kind of stuff you know goes on
 Uh we have to uh we have to have a state inspection every year
 Do you all have that
 So 
 which I 
 I don- 
 I would assu- 
 So I'm assu- I'm assuming that you know they check they check everything for safety 
 or 
 But that's all they check for 
 they don't check how good 
 if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough
 We do that ev- every year
 Well I'll have to check 
 I'm not sure if if our state inspection ever- 
 once a year has to do you know 
 if they check the uh 
 Oh I would 
 I'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or or or anything
 Uh-huh
 Well 
 and that's not necessarily the answer either 
 because they've found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap
 So 
 but a lot of these uh 
 some of this 
 well you know a lot of people have well water 
 in fact in this area too 
 and an you know 
 and uh 
 if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're what you're drinking 
 and I I know a lot of people you know have that 
 and you know you have to wonder if that you know could have an adverse affect on them too if they don't i- they don't get it checked
 Uh-huh
 When we were 
 when I was growing up I lived in Huntsville Alabama
 and their water supply came from uh spring
 And it was like ice cold spring water 
 and I guess parts of the the city still ha- you know get that 
 but uh that was that was really wonderful
 It was really really good
