 Okay 
 Well like I was saying Burlington's crime it doesn't involve children 
 and what you see on the T Vs from you know in Washington and New York 
 So what I believe the people want 
 the subject is is big city crime which is something that I don't have any first hand experiences about 
 but I have you know concerns 
 and I have a few ideas of um how to combat it 
 I don't I don't think ideally you know you need money to do everything 
 so That's one thing 
 that that's that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money 
 So 
 Oh 
 Does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the more the uh retired people's community 
 or does it stay in the bad neighborhoods
 So that's a big concern if you live there is to really lock your car up 
 Oh my it sounds like um San Juan Puerto Rico 
 we were there just well for a lay over
 and um well it wasn't a lay over 
 we were we had we were staying at the other end of the island 
 and we drove into San Juan to catch our plane
 It was at night 
 and this boy really wanted to go on the beach 
 and they look at you crazy
 you don't go on the beach
 Well it's a big tourist town you know 
 don't they don't people go for a walk on the beach at night 
 And they said no 
 it's very safe in the daytime
 but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens pretty much telling people be wary you know and get off the beach
 Well what they what they say they try to do is to get the kids um early and young
 And what we have here in Burlington which it doesn't cost a lot of money but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids
 They set up kids with elderly people in the winter time they shovel their snow 
 They have a big brother big sister program
 They have bottle drives 
 they have cleanup outings 
 And they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer 
 and they have gyms open 
 And it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs after school you might keep them
 but you again you need that one on one like a big brother trying to keep the younger kid you know tell him hey stay in school 
 it'll get better you know 
 so that your mom doesn't have a job 
 and she doesn't work 
 you don't know 
 you can be better than that 
 You don't have to live on the you know for a street life
 But 
 Yeah 
 but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here 
 um they can deal with that scale 
 They might have five hundred troubled youths
 When you have five thousand troubled youths plus when you're getting into th- well the kids now it's twelve years old 
 and they're selling drugs
 and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun
 It's just it's the morals of the people which I guess we everybody's responsible for the society 
 but if I had a child that that did things so bad 
 it's not they don't care about anybody
 these people they're stealing from they're just the big bad rich guy
 and we don't have it 
 so we deserve it 
 and we should take it
 Yes
 Well I think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too 
 We're talking these kids are fourteen years old 
 The parents might be thirty years old
 and I'm thirty years old 
 and I'm kind of irresponsible 
 but I have the morals that keep me from you know 
 if I was going to go out and drink or do something I wouldn't do it in front of my child 
 These people you know they bring their their Johns home 
 and they bring their drugs home 
 and the kids are just sitting there in the same room
 It's just that they have absolutely no no morals
 and it's really sad
 But I like your idea of education 
 if the parents aren't supplying it they've got to get it from someone else from the schools
 Yeah 
 it's really sad 
 like if they did have a big brother big sister program 
 those those people trying to help the kids 
 the parents might have hostilities towards them you know Like you're judging us 
 and I'm not good enough to raise my child which basically is true
 It's it's it's 
 I'm glad I don't live in a big city just because not just because I wouldn't feel safe 
 it's just because that I would be reminded every day of something that I don't see 
 and I might see it on a you know a SIXTY MINUTES special
 I know it 
 but San Antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not 
 they have all kinds of nice write ups about it
 but any big city has a bad section
 Yes 
 they're very bold it seems
 Really 
 even uh even in the worst crime areas in Burlington 
 I I can walk the streets 
 I wouldn't 
 I if I did it every night I think there would be trouble in our house 
 so you wouldn't get confronted or anything
 but I don't think you would uh 
 someone might grab you mess around with you 
 but they're not going to grab you steal you- your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities 
 that's what you your going to have to expect that to happen 
 People are just totally unfeeling
