 All right do you do exercise
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Well um that's a hard question to answer because I do physical things but I don't always set out for them to be exercise
 I walk with my parents occasionally 
 nothing's real regular about this because I have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule
 and um I play racquetball 
 but I haven't since I've been out of school 
 I don't have anywhere to do that 
 but that's going to start soon again
 and um I play softball once a week which is kind of more recreation than exercise
 Because I really don't like to exercise 
 I think that's the basic point of it is I'm not I I don't enjoy it if I know that it's exercise 
 but if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity I don't mind
 so I have to disguise it 
 it's like feeding little babies food and telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it
 That's kind of the same thing for me 
 I have to not know that it's exercise so I can do it
 Well yeah 
 if it's exercise it's a task
 I don't want to do anything I have to do
 I'll voluntarily clean the bathroom 
 but I won't do it if I have to do it
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I'm twenty-two
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Eating right and no cholesterol and all that
 Yeah 
 we 
 I'm sure I will do 
 I'm doing that more and more than I used to
 I'm getting better about this knowing that I need exercise and doing it but it's still at the task stage
 Is it a pleasure for you 
 or are you 
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 that's 
 I never got past that stage
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 That's good
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 that's it 
 I do the occasional push up and sit up 
 I haven't really brought myself to go to the the gym because that's very stressful to me 
 because I feel I felt real competitive there 
 and I need to find some place I could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 That's a good idea 
 but I do have my ride 
 we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house
 I'll do those once in a while just you know like at eleven thirty when Love Connection's on and I can't sleep 
 I'll get up and stair step for half an hour
 so 
 It's I guess pretty pretty healthy 
 but I don't have a regular plan that's 
 I need to get started on that
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sleep 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 That'll come some day when I 
 Right
 Well I hope so
 Yeah 
 sounds good
 Yeah 
 you too 
 Have a nice day
 Bye
