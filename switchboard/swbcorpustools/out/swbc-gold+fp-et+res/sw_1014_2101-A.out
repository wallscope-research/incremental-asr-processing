 Well do you have any uh television programs that you watch regularly
 Uh-huh
 No
 Uh-huh
 Oh you will
 Relax
 Well I watch um 
 I like news programs like you mentioned 
 and sometimes I will watch um like the cable news network evening news program
 Yeah 
 I I like that 
 I I watch that a couple of times a week um 
 it comes on like at nine o'clock at night 
 and I really don't have any like situation comedies that I watch regularly 
 I I have seen that um MURPHY BROWN that comes on Monday nights before 
 and it's kind of cute
 and but I don't 
 Uh-huh
 Oh but 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I know who you're talking about 
 I haven't + I have seen it I think maybe once
 I like that 
 Well I um I 
 we really don't watch too many programs regularly 
 My children like some of the morning children's shows when they're home 
 They um 
 I just have one son who's in kindergarten 
 so in the morning they will like to watch like um EUREKA'S CASTLE it's called 
 It's just like a SESAME STREET show 
 but and they watch a couple of shows like that 
 but I don't watch any daytime T V at all
 And uh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Oh that's nice
 Uh-huh
 That sounds like a good idea 
 I notice that um since we moved here that we we did get the cable T V 
 and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed
 and I record some 
 And then uh we have just totally cut down 
 and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and then and watch and then record over it something else 
 And so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved
 Uh-huh
 Well that's probably what I watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies 
 and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies that I have really enjoyed that I'm seeing for the first time Like the MARX BROTHERS and things like that
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 And so we we have really enjoyed that 
 and it's really nice not to be running out 
 Some of the video rentals can be expensive 
 and 
 Uh-huh 
 right 
 Going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something 
 So we 
 I have 
 and it's so convenient at home 
 and you can do it anytime y- you take the notion
 And so I have really enjoyed that 
 but but there are 
 I do have friends that watch programs 
 like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it 
 They have some programs that they won't miss
 Yes 
 Well and things are repeated so often that you know if if I have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show if I ever decide to tune it in again
 the only one I've ever seen and it'll be showing again 
 Pretty funny
 But uh T V is something that we try an- to not um deliberately try not to get hung up on it like you say
 Uh-huh 
 And we don't want our kids to to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your spare time
 So it's a little bit something that we try doing 
 and there's there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day
 And you could say oh that's a good program for them because it's educational 
 but still you want them to go out and do other things 
 Even if they're good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them
 Anyway Well 
 Yeah 
 That was pretty good 
 I I like that 
 and um I guess it's time to go
 Yes 
 Nice to have spoken with you too
 Bye-bye
