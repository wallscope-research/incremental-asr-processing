 Okay 
 well just to let you know I have uh two uh children of my own 
 I've got two boys uh one four year old and one two years old 
 so I'm just starting out
 Wow 
 Wow 
 that's quite a spread 
 That's great
 Well I guess uh in one of the things that that I like to do with my boys when uh when I get home is I like to try and spend a lot of time with them 
 You know they're not very old 
 so they couldn't do a whole lot yet
 But they like to uh spend time with me 
 We just oh just do various things nothing really 
 They like to be outside as much as possible
 Right uh
 but you know the weather's trying to turn now 
 so 
 Yes 
 I I'm I'm in uh Dallas
 Right 
 right
 Right
 Yeah 
 what w- well 
 one of the things I've noticed is one of the trends I've I've noticed is that uh it's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the T V and let them watch movies or or play video games or something
 Sure
 Sure
 That's okay
 No 
 it's okay 
 Uh so that was the thing that I I noticed that I know a lot of people lot of friends that we have they have a tendency to do the same thing 
 And one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible Although it really is very easy to do that type of thing Just plop them down in front of the T V and let them be uh entertained that way
 And uh seeing as you've got some older children I I'm wondering how did you handle that when they were growing up
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Um
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 Uh-huh <>
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh that's nice
 That's great
 That's great 
 I know we'd I'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things 
 And I think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older 
 But uh you know for right now they don't you know 
 just getting out in the front and just being outside is good for them 
 because they like just being outside
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 That's true 
 you don't see many leaves around Dallas
 Uh-huh
