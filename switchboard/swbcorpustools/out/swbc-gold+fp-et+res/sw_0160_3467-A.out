 I said Arlington Texas because the other day I was talking with somebody 
 and he was in Arlington Virginia 
 Yeah 
 that's the only one I've got now for this area
 Well anyway we've got a easy subject
 You go ahead first if you'd like
 Yeah 
 you know you get so busy
 Oh 
 I know
 Right
 Are they little
 Yeah 
 they're pretty young
 I don't know 
 my kids are older
 so I don't I don't know some of those shows now like I used to 
 Right
 Well I I like the comedies 
 They're just light too 
 I have to watch MURPHY BROWN 
 I really like 
 I make a point of that 
 I love that 
 and I really like COACH 
 I think it's when it's good it's just a scream
 Well he's probably playing himself 
 Half the time you see these people on an interview show they're they act just like they do in their parts 
 He 
 I saw him on JOHNNY CARSON once 
 and he acted about the same 
 Yeah 
 and uh 
 Well I watch more now because well I I had been going to school for years and have really been too busy
 but this semester I'm only taking one course 
 and so I see MURPHY BROWN and COACH and THE WONDER YEARS 
 I just make a point of seeing those
 Oh it's fabulous 
 Really you should never miss that 
 It they are just gems of shows they really fabulous in every way 
 Oh that's Wednesday at uh seven thirty
 Oh yeah
 Sure 
 yeah 
 well maybe maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime
 Just so you get the idea 
 It wouldn't take Wouldn't take much to get hooked on those 
 So so I watch those
 Well you know I haven't oh 
 yeah 
 we started watching NORTHERN EXPOSURE 
 Well it's not really new 
 but it's still kind of new
 I like it a lot 
 It's real different 
 In fact they never thought it would be a hit
 they'll have some things in there that almost almost you know like supernatural or something 
 you know somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does 
 or it sounds weird 
 but it's very uh unique show and very well done
 Excellent actors
 I I guess we just 
 it came on after something we used to watch
 and I guess we just kept sitting there 
 and then now we make a point of watching 
 I can't take all these shows on because next semester I'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television
 Well then it will be mostly reruns I guess 
 And by the end of February the way they do it nowadays
 But uh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I've seen that
 Was she the was she the best one Was she the best one on that old show
 Really
 Right 
 right
 Yeah 
 they had a big fight on that show didn't they
 They were all accusing each other of everything in the world 
 Well I know 
 gosh you never will probably
 Well I think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable
 I don't have cable
 It's just as wild as any soap opera from what I hear on the news
 And I think he's guilty as the devil
 I know 
 what's in it for her 
 There's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that Because you know they tear you to shreds especially those rich high powered lawyers
 Um
 I know 
 everybody was saying that 
 and then in the paper said it 
 so It should be interesting
 Well the NATIONAL ENQUIRER says 
 I was reading that in the supermarket line 
 I never have the nerve to buy the thing 
 Uh
 Says he 
 No 
 I don't care anything about that
 I like the ice skating 
 you know occasionally some ice skating will come on on a Sunday or during the Olympics
 I always watch that 
 I think it's so beautiful
 Oh yeah 
 that's good
