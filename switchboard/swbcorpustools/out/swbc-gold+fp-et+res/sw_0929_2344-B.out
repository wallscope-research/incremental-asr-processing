 Hello
 Hi
 Hi Ken 
 my name's Diane
 Yes 
 I'm in San Antonio
 Oh
 Okay
 Yes
 I think they'll always represent a threat wheth- whether or not there's an active cold war or not Uh 
 it's it's a totally different economy based on different beliefs and and uh different priorities 
 and uh given the the uh military powers on both sides I think it's always a threat
 Probably not 
 no
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 and and it's recognized that the two great powers are us and them 
 and and the great powers are always pitted against each other
 I don't know 
 They they're going downhill pretty steady
 But I I agree right now they're not 
 I don't believe they're a large threat right now 
 I think there's always some threat
 Yeah
 Actually I feel kind of sorry for them right now because the people are are are uh wanting things that we have that they're not allow- 
 just some basic freedoms 
 and and their government is not allowing it 
 and Gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying to push
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 See I'm concerned that that since he's banned demonstrations altogether that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in Tiananmen Square 
 and he's going to wipe out no telling how many of his own countrymen uh right in the middle of Red Square 
 and uh it's going to cause a more civil war than is already occurring
 I don't know 
 and it it might be something that he wouldn't be able to control
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we've got our own worries at the moment
 I guess as long as uh they're fighting each other we don't have to worry about them wasting their time with us
 Well sure 
 that but that's a that's an impossibility I think given the differences in the world 
 and people are just too different
 But unfortunately people people aren't that insightful
 They just see that this guy prays differently and to someone else than I do 
 So therefore he's wrong 
 and he's bad 
 and we have to wipe wipe him out
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I haven't read it 
 I've heard all about it though
 Yeah
 Yes 
 but people grow up 
 and they forget
 Well 
 That's one of the places I would most like to go 
 Not right now of course
 but at some point I would like to go to Moscow and and to just to see all these things that you can see on television now and can read about 
 that ten years ago we didn't have this kind of information
 and we didn't know what things were like 
 So 
 Yeah 
 I and I the the people 
 I just feel so sorry for the people in the country that they can't they they can't do any- 
 they can't change it 
 They try 
 they and they there's nothing that they can do
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It's it's probably not dissimilar from the uh what are they the the the I'm trying to think of the name of the the something like that in Northern Iraq who are actually countrymen of 
 some of them were split off into Israel I believe 
 and some of them are in Turkey when actually they they don't they're their own people and their beliefs and their own culture system
 And they were split up into three different countries
 And and they're very dissatisfied 
 and they're they're causing wars right now 
 and I don't think it's that different from what the Baltic states are are going through
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 The the one that I think 
 one of the wom- women that I work for is married to an Iranian 
 and so she has a lot of insight because she knows a lot of the history of the countries over there 
 and within five or six countries there are probably ten cultures of people
 And that's they don't all have their own country 
 and and some of them are mad about it 
 Oh
 Oh uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and I don't think the people here two hundred years ago were that different 
 I really don't
 they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs
 The- the- they might 
 The Baltic states might be feeling the same way that our forefathers felt when they were leaving to come here
