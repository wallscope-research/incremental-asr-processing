 Are you still there
 Okay 
 it worked out fine
 Well we just ate out um had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late 
 and we had Italian um 
 have you ever been to the Olive Garden
 Yeah 
 Well do you really like Italian food
 Then don't 
 Then this will probably 
 this isn't really excellent Italian food
 That sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great 
 but it's um 
 you're not going to believe this 
 but I have to tell you this if I don't because you're in Plano
 but my um softball unit here is acting like he's dying of tramane poison 
 It wasn't that bad 
 actually it's very good it's all of these run adult males 
 which I'm not Italian 
 no 
 it's it's all the garlic bread and all the salads you can eat with an entree
 So it wasn't too bad it really wasn't 
 but I was more in the mood for french toast any way 
 so so I really like Italian food though 
 but do you have any favorite
 Uh yes 
 uh-huh
 Oh you're kidding
 Oh sure
 Yeah 
 You can usually get a variety of what you're looking for like at Gatti's or something like that
 Uh six thirty-five
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 Pappasito's
 We went there on my birthday in March it's great
 too much like a bar naturally and Mexico 
 yeah 
 I know 
 I've seen it
 The food is probably 
 I'm not a I'm Mexican food gourmet by any means 
 but it's probably the best tasting 
 I don't know would you classify that as Tex-Mex
 Um the shredded beef the type of spices or sauces they use
 Really 
 Uh-huh 
 I've never had anything there that wasn't delicious
 Even though you have to stand in line and all of that that's the only thing I don't like about it too 
 it's a little bit with th- the meat market atmosphere you know
 Even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to um be around not be around that
 Um I'm trying to think of what else we like to eat 
 The one thing I notice is it's just um about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt we find prohibited just to cost any more
 lunch today was eighteen dollars
 Yeah 
 I don't know how you feel about that 
 but I think that some of it's over priced
 I'm glad I'm talking about food normally these conversations are 
 Yeah 
 it is I don't know um
 Uh-huh 
 Oh yeah 
 my husband likes that 
 yeah 
 off of Arapaho down there
 Yeah 
 August Moon 
 uh-huh
 I don't like it at all usually 
 so 
 Yeah 
 I love seafood
 and I I like a lot of different ethnic foods 
 I like Japanese food 
 There's a place on Greenville called Sagar's 
 Well we haven't been in years down near Presby 
 and I had a meeting down there today 
 and I saw that 
 and I said gee I remember that they offer you um authentic Japanese feeding or American or piano bar 
 and I remember when we went we were married with another couple that was just dating 
 and um I had never had saki
 It made all raw fish tastes great 
 but if you're looking for a very uh 
 it's very pretty inside
 and the girls wear kimonos and You know if you're ever looking for that
 Um but what other kind of foods 
 gee I don't know 
 we went to a place called Grishman's in Greenville which was really over priced 
 Uh-huh 
 They had a great desert bar
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I like barbecue 
 have you ever been to th- I think it's called Spring Creek Barbecue
 That's real good 
 Yeah
 There had 
 oh my husband's going upstairs 
 and he says free ice cream 
 I didn't know they had that
 I can't talk I had chocolate bavarian tort for desert today which I never eat at lunch 
 and it was wonderful
 It was
 in fact if I could pick my um restaurants on how their coffee is and how their french bread is and the butter and the desert I would be yes I would be in hog heaven 
 And how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want 
 or do you still order for them
 Oh congratulations 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 everybody every child that I even know that eats vegetables um looked five years old still after a certain age realized that there is something called a McDonald's
 It's really sad isn't it cause it's hard to get them away from junk then
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 I know where that 
 Right 
 that's all 
 Well that's all right as long as 
 I was going to say because with six people how do you um 
 cause with two we have a problem 
 I can't even imagine you know trying to um 
 you sound like you're doing pretty well with four children
 That's the way the 
 Yeah 
 well we're getting ready to 
 I shouldn't say this on this conversation 
 but it's just on my mind 
 we're getting ready to go overseas to adopt
 Yeah 
 we're excited
 I think it will be worth it 
 and somebody said to me in terms of 
 this is food so I can say this 
 but they you have to bring a formula 
 and I said what's that 
 They laughed 
 and I said well you know I'm thirty something 
 and I think that that would make them drool any way
 You know I guess are you is it a little bit of constricted because a lot of restaurants don't take 
 in terms of talking about restaurants are a lot of restaurants how are they when you have children let alone three or four children
 Uh-huh 
 Sure 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 That yuppie kind of crowd yeah
 Yeah
 I just I just I've been in some places where they say they take children 
 and then I've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude you know
 And that always just bothered me 
 and then um on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves 
 I don't know what other kind of restaurants 
 really Pappasito's we love um 
 we went to one Italian 
 back on the Italian we went to some place across from Collin Creek Mall that absolutely putrid for Italian food
 I can't remember the name of it 
 it's on uh 
 No 
 that's Mexican um right across from on the Dillard's side there
 I can't 
 yeah 
 it's in the strip yeah 
 and it had white tablecloth 
 I think it was like paper where you could write on them or something with crayons 
 it was just terrible
 I was shocked 
 the dish was dirty um
 Yeah 
 where you felt like like when you're in a bad part of Italy or something
 Um
 Boy 
 but other then that I don't know we we do our share of pizza eating too but more like go get it and carry it in cause we're too cheap to pay the delivery 
 I don't like strange people coming to my door um
 No 
 except that this makes me fat 
 No 
 I'm just kidding
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 but you can always blame it on having children 
 no 
 Well I enjoyed talking to you 
 and I guess you know Maybe we'll see you in the restaurants somewhere
 Okay
 Bye-bye
