 Well I don't do anything with the lawn really 
 but I do gardening both flowers and vegetable gardening
 Um I 
 we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden 
 and that's fun 
 well actually Wally's had one even when we haven't had big yard because um we enjoy that 
 We love fresh vegetables in the summer 
 and it's just one of the things I enjoy doing
 So would I 
 Yes 
 I do
 Uh so I manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward 
 I work for a school system 
 so I'm able to do that um because I get home a little earlier
 and I can still do some some sorts of things 
 but 
 Oh absolutely 
 Wow
 Oh that's wonderful
 But that that's 
 and you really feel you can accomplish something 
 and to help other people too that's neat
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 That's wonderful
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 well I think it sounds good 
 I've never belonged to a garden club because I've always been more interested in just doing what I can do on my own 
 I've never had the time really to get involved in the organized sort of format 
 but I know people who do it and and enjoy it very much
 Oh 
 My word
 For heaven's sake
 Well um there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that I know of 
 they're they're women 
 But um and usually they're the tea type things you know where they have a little luncheon 
 and they do their thing
 But um flowers are primarily the emphasis um whereas I enjoy vegetable gardening almost more I do flowers sort of look pretty 
 but I I really like to do the vegetables
 Being what
 Oh my 
 Well what a wonderful thing
 Yes
 Oh terrible 
 yeah
 Okay 
 Well uh the flowers I'm just 
 in fact I was going to go out today to buy some plants so I could put them in 
 I I always have geraniums 
 and um and then I have a shady area that I need to uh be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun 
 so I've discovered that uh impatiens that tried and true is turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus Because they uh look pretty and in my front garden uh 
 but I like the vinca which is something I hadn't 
 they look sort of like impatiens 
 you know but they're not quite 
 and they're better for the sun areas 
 Um and of course you know the mine are old theory ordinary flowers marigolds and and that sort of thing
 In my 
 No 
 I don't
 I don't know 
 maybe this climate is a little better
 Um but in the vegetable garden we grow um usually what 
 our favorite is something called white half runner green beans 
 now that's 
 Well you know why because I grew up in North Carolina
 and that was my mother's um favorite bean 
 she alw- she always grows you know five different varieties
 but that's the kind that produces the best
 And and they're wonderful 
 and I pick them when they're very young and have very little string and then just steam them a little bit 
 my mother picks them when they're fat 
 and she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs 
 and they're good both ways 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Oh in between the 
 size wise 
 yeah
 yeah 
 Well my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them 
 Oh of course 
 Yeah 
 it is 
 They're two different vegetables that way 
 uh-huh
 Oh my gosh 
 My does mot- mother will be th- ninety this year 
 and she lives in western North Carolina 
 and uh she would do that if if we didn't tell her that she'd better not 
 But she doesn't have that big a garden 
 but she has a bigger one than I do
 And I have four children you know 
 so 
 Oh yes 
 oh yes
 Oh it is 
 it's great 
 It's it's really her joy 
 and I suppose that's why I enjoy gardening because you know growing up with it
 We also grow um yellow and green squash um much to my children's chagrin
 and uh we grow a lot of tomatoes uh
 there's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes
 So we enjoy that 
 um we grow 
 I I have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family 
 but I actually was successful for the last two years 
 so 
 I'm going to do it again
 That's right 
 And we grow broccoli
 And I have been very uh happy about the new way of controlling the the uh worm that gets in broccoli um by using the Bacillus Thuringiansis which is the uh little 
 well in fact that's what they use for gypsy moth 
 I don't know if you have had that problem there or not
 But it's you know it's a problem that's that's moving south from from the New England area
 And they devastate the trees 
 so they they spray the government uh sprays um t- two three times in the spring when the uh caterpillars are are coming along because what they do this this uh bacillus um the worms ingest it 
 and it expands in their in their um digestive tract 
 and they die
 So that's the same technique that is you know for any of the other uh little varmints that get in vegetables 
 so it 
 that's really very nice because it's a non toxic way of of handling the problem
 Well it's nice hearing you talk 
 and I'm I wish you uh good luck 
 have you just recently moved to Charlotte
 Oh so well that's not very long
 Yes 
 Oh that's great 
 that's great
 Well I hope you have a an opportunity to garden again
 Oh well good 
 Bye-bye
