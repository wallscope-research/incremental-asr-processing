 Up up there maybe maybe you guys don't have as uh big a problem with air pollution as many do you
 Do you really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's horrible
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh

 Well uh in Dallas I I haven't seen air pollution quite on a quite on a level that we had in Denver 
 I grew up in Denver 
 and and I've lived there most of my life 
 and we used to have those uh you know the posted warning days 
 Uh however in Colorado now they have the emissions control law which has really cut down 
 probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to po- post warnings now you know as far as health concerns
 Uh due to that emi- the the emissions uh uh control on the vehicles seems that all of our all of our uh smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry

 Oh really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh

 Yeah

 maybe to you and I who have grown up in some in uh uh some more beautiful parts of the country uh I think that that uh we become a little more aware uh rather quickly of of what's happening with air pollution and how uh how horrible it really is

 Oh really 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right

 Do you find that um do you hypothesize that that most of the uh smog or or air pollution comes from vehicles 
 or does it come mostly from industry up there
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I had talked with my parents 
 I I grew up uh I was born in uh Muncie Indiana and and grew up a little bit in Terre Haute

 I went back to visit recently about a year ago 
 and I asked them 
 I said did you ever realize the air pollution that was
