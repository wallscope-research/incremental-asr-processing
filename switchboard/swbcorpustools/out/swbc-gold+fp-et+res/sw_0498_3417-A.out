 Yes 
 Um I guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years despite our total tax burden despite tax cuts 
 but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in in the world 
 and in 
 of the matter 
 you get what you pay for 
 if we're going to have national health insurance which seems likely it's necessarily going to involve more taxes 
 Uh I suspect I take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes uh energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes that's the direction we should look
 Where's it all going 
 Well one one one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into into a big trust fund 
 but that is a particularly regressive tax uh 
 it's a tax on the first dollar earnings 
 and Senator Moynihan's uh proposal to to to cut there I think wou- makes a lot of sense
 I think Senator Moynihan's proposal to to cut the social security tax which isn't really going to going to beef up up up the social security program could make a lot of sense
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 I think Japan I think Japan is probably about equal to ours
 and other major countries are higher 
 Our friends were amazed that the sales taxes the cost of things when they went to Canada not so long ago 
 And as a whole most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services 
 and it's a real real 
 they're they're real trade-offs there
 Uh I 
 that's that's a scary thing that there's no no real knowing about 
 Uh the the there's a lot of inflation risk that isn't taken care of in most private pension plans
 No 
 I'm at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Uh part of the Commerce Department Here in Gaithersburg Maryland
 Well well 
 I I I didn't pick it uh
 um I like I don't really recall 
 I may have filled out on the on the form 
 but I I certainly certainly have the feeling I've been given topics different from the ones that I mentioned before
 Yes 
 yes 
 when you place a call topic is given to you
 Oh you should try it
 Uh many of the subjects are Uh taxes taxes especially 
 Um one thing that has kept our tax burden high and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the is the level of def- of the defense budget
 and that's that same subject
