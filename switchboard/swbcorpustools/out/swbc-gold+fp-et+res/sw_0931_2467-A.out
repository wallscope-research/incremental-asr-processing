 So uh describe your family budget
 Well yeah 
 and to some extent utilities I imagine
 They have that to some extent here 
 but it's not quite as good
 And uh transportation expenses 
 I guess you own a car
 And you know how much you're going to drive every week
 Huh
 Yeah 
 I understand that 
 We we have a real similar situation 
 Ours uh have quintupled at least 
 So there is a real family budget
 Yeah
 If you're lucky
 Exempt or nonexempt
 Wow 
 must be nice
 Part of the high price spread Uh 
 no 
 well we don't we do 
 but we don't have a family budget 
 We have the fixed things we have to pay
 And we have the things that are extras 
 But it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist
 And well you know the auto budget 
 car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry
 And insurance 
 is insurance bad there
 Well we've got one eighty-nine
 Wow 
 That's not bad 
 four hundred and something a year 
 That's that's 
 That's cheaper than we pay
 Well here in Colorado it's even worse because we have no fault
 Do you have that there
 Well no fault's rather funny in Colorado because it seems that <> everyone pays all the time instead of just the guilty party pays
 You're kidding
 God
 Not at all
 They don't even try to keep up with it
 God
 So you lived in Texas for a while
 Huh
 Are where you from originally
 Huh 
 so you just basically went home when you had a chance
 That's nice
 God 
 that's great 
 Uh I'm a native Texan
 West Texan
 There is a difference
 Yeah
 Well I'm a West Texan
 Lubbock Midland Odessa Amarillo Dumas Panhandle
 A different world from down there
 So uh Colorado's been fun 
 But they have a real problem 
 Next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile 
 And every time you look at a look at the mountains or think about looking at the mountains you got to throw in a dollar
 Or so it seems 
 I may just be paranoid 
 but that state income tax is just eating me alive
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Property taxes and 
 Yeah 
 well Colorado ins- you know they have the state income tax 
 but then they also have property taxes 
 and they also have sales taxes 
 and they just get you every direction they can
 And I just don't know sir 
 but it seems like they trying to get you every which way
 Oh yeah
 I've heard of the book
 Legally
 Legally cut money on your taxes 
 Huh
 And that includes everyone at T I
 Well even the you know the nonexempts technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet
 But when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter
 You know survival is a funny state
 Yeah
 Did well I've been with the company for sixteen years now 
 I was a W F for several years 
 and it just n- never seems to improve 
 It and it doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either unless you're twenty-eight or above
 It's really a shame
 Oh
