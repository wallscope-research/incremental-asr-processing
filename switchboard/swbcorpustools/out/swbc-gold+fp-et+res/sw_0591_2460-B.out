 Well what are the others
 Well it's helpful
 Well do you keep up with the statistical stuff
 Well there's there's a guy on that was on show that I listen to going to work in the morning who does uh uh 
 it's essentially trivial statistics
 but they've got a st- 
 it's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games
 And apparently the Rangers last year won a lot of one run games
 Well it it it is 
 but it's the it's it's a reverse indicator
 Well what the what the argument is 
 and it it it it's one of these statistical 
 gee how can you draw a conclusion from it 
 but they find that tha- tha- there's a connection between that and how they do in Spring training the following year
 And uh it's strangely enough it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year
 Which means that if you have a good year winning one ru- one run games that the following year you'll have a bad year 
 And they they've got um they've looked at I think twenty-three teams uh 
 and and the uh statistics are something like twenty-one out of twenty-three 
 It was 
 which means the Rangers are going to have a terrible year 
 I uh 
 Well and it's uh uh 
 I don't know 
 what do you what do you think of Incaviglia's loss
 Well it it's an interesting concept though when you look at uh of of how baseball how apparently 
 I was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going to sign him 
 And uh and the point of of I guess 
 I don't understand the the strategy of how baseball works 
 but it seems that you know they can sign him tomorrow
 and he could go in the team the next day 
 and and and they put him in the lineup 
 and he hits a home run 
 and all of a sudden he becomes a hero
 And and all he has to do is hit the ball 
 you're not a- 
 and all he has to do is one you know hit it once 
 It doesn't 
 he can he can stri- he can swing a couple times 
 if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can
 It's an interesting uh an interesting concept of of how they do it 
 But I agree with you 
 I think that I think that's part of what uh baseball needs more of 
 I uh I I guess what bothers me is is that when you go um you wait and wait and wait 
 and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run 
 and that's all the game is 
 I'd rather see the ball hit around and have the people 
 Yes
 Yeah 
 well how do you think the Royals are going to do
 Well are they going to beat are they going to beat Oakland
 Yeah
 Well I go to Saint Louis from time to time 
 and I watch I I watch their sports up there 
 and they're uh they're certainly intense about the Cardinals they 
 Y- did you actually live in Saint Louis
 Ye- everybody does right
 I had a friend from college that lives in uh 
 it's well I should say on the west side 
 everything's on the west side 
 Manchester
 Uh out that way
 and I went and visited him 
 but anyway it is interesting 
 Well how are the Cardinals 
 Do you still keep up with them or someth-
 Well is that a good indicator
 You know what I think is remarkable is uh 
 it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have have have real breakthrough years
 And and the question is how do you forecast that
 if you had to if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series it would be really tough
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well well when are the Rangers going to come through th- 
 Well is there enough money 
 that's part of it 
 I uh 
 that was part of Skip Bayless' argument
 I don't know if you read Skip Bayless but a a local commentary 
 and his argument is that uh the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to to bring in the big dollars
 Would you would you agree with that
 Uh
 Yeah
 Well didn't Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff 
 Yeah
 Well and that I think that's maybe part of it that that the um 
 and it you know 
 if I owned the team I think you'd like them to do well 
 but the question of losing big big money that what did did did Steinbrenner actually make money on the 
 Well it's it it yeah it's a little bit like any other sport you know 
 When it starts costing you fifty or a hundred dollars to go to a game 
 and uh you know I I guess as we get older i- you're probably going 
 if if you if you compare to go to a a sport a a 
 say you go to a rock concert or or even a performance a an opera or the symphony or something uh 
 if you know i- 
 but how how often do you do that
 An 
 I I I would I would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there you know several times a 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 but don't you think there's a there there are older fans there 
 I I don't mean older um you know 
 the fact that that it's it's a better established and that the the city is is is more of a
