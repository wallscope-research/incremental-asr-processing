 All right
 I guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force
 Few are uh basically staying home and being homemakers and raising kids exclusively
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 true 
 Well mine taught kindergarten 
 but she was always uh 
 I guess her schedule was shorter 
 so she was always uh home 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 that that statistic I guess has been growing every year 
 it's like something around sixty sixty-five percent or so now
 Uh I'm not sure what the future holds for that 
 whether 
 Uh-huh 
 Huh
 That's unusual 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that is tough 
 Yeah 
 we're looking at that now 
 my wife's about six months along
 Uh-huh
 True
 Yeah 
 I'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home 
 I would think it would be women that were working full-time
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh Well I guess that's good that they they've got something to keep them active
 Yeah 
 we're we're going to try and have her stay home for as long as possible 
 <> What do you think
 Yeah 
 we think it's uh that important 
 and I I kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction 
 I'm a a counselor and a therapist
 and I work with adolescents 
 and I see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 True 
 Well the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure 
 and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too
 So kids are raised around their friends and by the media
 And that's you know that's contributed
 Yeah 
 maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time 
 so If there was some way for for women to to stay home even if they could work you know 
 there are a lot of jobs that are coming about like in computers at home and those types of things that would at least in some ways um bridge the gap <>
 About
 The balance 
 I don't 
 the the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so 
 and it got higher than that for a while 
 Um that's hard to say 
 Families are such a strange configuration anymore 
 Um I I see a lot of families where 
 you know in the in the back 
 I grew up about the same time you did
 and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible
 Uh nowadays it's not the case 
 kids don't kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk 
 and one of the reasons I guess is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working 
 They get bombarded with junk 
 and they don't have to do anything around the house 
 They never learned to be responsible when 
 the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while 
 and they come back 
 and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad 
 so 
 you know you create a bigger bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose
 So It's not not a real functional situation anyway 
 So you know I don't know it's I don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families 
 and the families as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it is 
 I guess unless unless there's a a major swing in the change of what's important to people you know probably keep going downhill 
 And I I don't know 
 we we feel like that that we can make it on one income 
 it it may be tough 
 but we may have to give up on some some things
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think so too
 Okay
 Well I've enjoyed it Stephanie
 Uh-huh
 Bye-bye
