 Okay 
 what kind of car are you thinking about buying next
 What year
 Oh okay 
 Well I have a ninety Honda Civic 
 and I'm ready to get rid of it 
 Actually 
 No 
 uh well I ha- I had an eighty-eight that I really liked 
 and it got wrecked 
 and so I bought a ninety um because I I really liked my eighty-eight 
 and I've had a lot of problems with this one 
 so 
 Well you 
 it's it's kind of funny um 
 I know a lot
 Oh
 Yeah
 It's it's true 
 it's definitely true because 
 Yeah 
 well Honda does too that's why I was really 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 That's true
 That's true
 No
 not at all
 Oh I I definitely agree with you there because I had uh uh uh Ford T Bird before I got my Honda 
 and it was the worst car I've ever owned 
 and um that's why I was so tickled with my Honda 
 it was just a wonderful car 
 and then it got wrecked 
 and you know I wouldn't even look at another car 
 I just went and bought a Honda I didn't even I didn't look around or anything I just said that this is what I want 
 and I really have had a lot of problems with it 
 but I don't know
 Well I'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty 
 but in the first twelve months that I owned it it was in the shop an average of about once a month 
 it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months 
 Yeah 
 it was 
 I was really disappointed because I was you know so hyped up on Honda 
 so 
 Yeah
 Well I know this 
 Well it's this is going to sound really strange 
 but I really like to have a Mazda M P V van 
 I really like those 
 and I have kids 
 so 
 They're a lot 
 I don't like the new style like of the Toyota van and the the new Chevy Lumina van
 I don't like those styles um the M P V is more of uh uh just uh I don't know what you normal 
 I don't know how to explain more of an old fashioned type 
 I I'm not sure how to explain it
 it looks I guess kind of like uh the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow
 no 
 what 
 Astro Astro I guess is what it something like that 
 but I used to really like the looks of the M P V because it looks more like a mini van rather than I think 
 Yeah 
 I have a couple kids 
 Oh yeah 
 definitely 
 But I know that it's got to have a radio it's got to have air conditioning 
 I'm sure you can uh relate to air conditioning Um living in Arizona 
 but and cruise control and tinted windows that's about it 
 it's got to have those things otherwise I don't care
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh really
 Sports car 
 I'd like to have a sports car too 
 but it's not practical for me 
 but 
 Yeah 
 Whoops 
 There's some kind of problems 
 Hello
 are you still there
 This is 
 something's wrong
 I don't know 
 it sounds funny though doesn't it
 Huh
 Oh at least 
 yeah
 I know well new cars aren't cheap anyway 
 but 
 Huh
 Yeah 
 we have we all have those kind of dreams too don't we
 What I'd really like to have 
 Yeah 
 This is strange
 Hello 
 I think something's wrong with this 
 I hope it's recording 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 you're right 
 Yeah
 Oh those are nice
 yeah 
 they're they're cute cars 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Wow I haven't seen those
 Wow
 Oh yeah 
 definitely
 If it's a limited edition usually no matter what it is if it's a limited edition it's usually worth something later on
 Yeah
 Oh
 Really
 Now see I would have never figured that I would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that's limited edition
 And well they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they
 Yeah
 That's true
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Huh
 Yeah 
 it really is
 Have you seen the new uh Dodge Stealth The the real nice one 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 the Mitsubishi is real nice looking too
 now those are nice 
 Right
 Right
 The expensive ones they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand 
 but those are pretty stripped 
 and there's nothing 
 there's really 
 that one's just more for looks you know 
 it doesn't have any really the performance that the expensive one does
 You know but I've seen one of those 
 and it's not that great because they really 
 Yeah 
 the- 
 like they have um better 
 it's not quite as nice for a little bit less
 Yeah 
 they're not really that bad 
 but I don't know 
 like I said it's it's still not practical for me 
 I have a hard time looking at cars like that because I think now there's no way I can do that 
 Right
 Oh really
 uh
