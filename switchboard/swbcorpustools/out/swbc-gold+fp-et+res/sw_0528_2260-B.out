 Okay
 I have to agree that 
 *[[listen]] And you're right 
 We we you know we do have a good government 
 We do have a lot of things that you know that you know the taxes are there to support 
 but I do think they're mismanaged 
 and I think that sometimes it's too easy of a I don't know to easy of an answer 
 It seems to say I'll tax them if you can't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the waste out of the spending
 Uh I don't know what y'all are paying in Dallas 
 but you know it seems like we pay the state 
 you know there's a 
 the taxes set by you know the state and the city can add theirs 
 and the county adds theirs 
 and you know we're paying almost eight percent sales tax right now Which seems to me nuts 
 I came from California 
 and you know when I left there we paid six cents on the dollar 
 and that was like one of the highest in the nation
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Ourselves is seven point seven five
 Whole state
 It drives me crazy 
 I'm thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about we don't want a state income tax 
 but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up 
 and they don't do anything about it You know
 I'm in Lubbock Texas
 Yeah
 That's true 
 And I did pay state tax in California 
 but my goodness 
 that that 
 the what did you call it the sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay
 You don't sound like you're from Dallas 
 Where do you do you come from originally 
 Texas
 Oh okay
 You just you just managed to escape the real Texan accent
 I thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there
 Yeah
 That's right
 Yeah
 Oh were you really trying to find someone at home
 Well you know um back then what they tried to do you know 
 the would always try to stump Jesus try to give him something that would contradict himself
 And so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation 
 And of course that's when he said well you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's 
 you render unto God what is God's
 And uh you know of course there 
 I don't think they really cared about the answer
 they just wanted to try and catch him in something 
 But but I believe in paying taxes 
 and yeah 
 like everybody else I try to take as many deductions as I can
 you know I don't want to pay more than I have to
 And I get outraged when I feel like they go up for useless reasons 
 but I believe that they're necessary
 So I really do
 Do you do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work 
 or 
 Schedule A
 Well yeah
 Did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder
 I didn't notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions the interest and other things 
 Yeah
 And it will help tremendously
 We bought ours five years ago 
 and it's 
 the one thing 
 it seems like you make those payments every month 
 and at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles
 So that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 That's right
 Huh-uh
 That's right
 That's right 
 My parents uh bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago
 And they did that 
 They thought their payment was automatically taken out like every other Wednesday
 And that's exactly right 
 Everyone 
 though the note is thirty years she said it's going be paid off in twenty or twenty one years or something like that
 Just because of exactly what you said
 You're making one more months payment every year
 Yeah
 So *[[needs slash]] That's a good way to do it
 *[[ba]] And when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know 
 it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well that's good though
 Yeah
 Well that's good though
 Is it kind of a buyers market down there
 Well that's good
 That's pretty excellent
 That's good
 Well I can't either 
 I appreciate the call though
 I enjoyed talking to you
