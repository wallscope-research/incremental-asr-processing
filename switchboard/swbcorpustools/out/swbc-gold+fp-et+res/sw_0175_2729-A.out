 Well uh I think she's mostly German Shepherd 
 Uh she was uh uh 
 a person lives across the street from me uh brought her home from work because a coworker of hers uh had this dog appear on its front doorstep
 somebody somebody abandoned her 
 and she's only about oh si- between six and eight six to eight weeks old 
 and uh uh I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though 
 She's o- she's that this young 
 and she's almost housebroken
 she actually asks to go out
 And uh yeah 
 I was amazed
 Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality 
 I don't know 
 I can't imagine what uh would have been wrong with this dog 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 I had a uh 
 last year I had ano- I had another German Shepherd 
 now this one was purebred 
 and uh he when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door 
 but uh managed to get him to a veterinarian in time
 and uh and on huge doses of antibiotics and he actually got over it with y- seven hundred dollars in vet bills
 um but he had actually was able to get him over that
 And then he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy 
 and uh he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing 
 and then he got hit by a Cadillac
 So I couldn't believe it 
 That was that was really hard
 And that was even harder for 
 I was on a business trip at the time 
 and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street
 so they just felt absolutely awful
 And I felt felt probably worse for them than than for me 
 because oh gosh they the uh this fellow's wife who was uh watching the dog pro- she I think she loved that dog more than I did 
 and uh She was jus- really attached to it 
 but uh it's unfortunate 
 but now I've got another one 
 so 
 Uh see he it it was just over a year
 Uh it was in March of last year 
 So uh yeah 
 it'd been didn't didn't have one for a whole year
 Yeah
 Right
 My dad's like that 
 he uh he had a beagle that he loved
 and uh when that beagle passed away uh he didn't want he wasn't going to have another dog 
 there's no way
 no 
 how and then uh the he the beagle died in I guess about October 
 and by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him uh I I gue- Humane Society and got uh got another one a stray
 And she she turned out to be a great dog 
 and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently 
 and again dad went through the whole thing
 but mom went an 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it is 
 Well hopefully this one here Cocoa will live a full life 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 That's not too bad 
 Golly the Golden Retriever's are good dogs too
 they're kind of like get that permanent smile to them
 they're always always happy 
 I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy
 Yeah
 Right
 This this friend of mine has th- well 
 it's the same guy that was watching uh my German Shepherd when he got hit 
 but uh went fishing with him on Friday and took 
 he's got a full a pure bred Golden Retriever 
 and then I had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy 
 and we went and took the two dogs up fishing
 And this 
 they just they had a ball romping around
 and you know you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in
 And uh this Golden Retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current 
 and uh 
 Well no 
 actually he had no trouble at all 
 He first jumped in 
 and I 
 he's he's just about a year old himself and never had really 
 I don't think he'd swum before
 But he jumped in in the the river
 Well the puppy jumped in the into some of the pools but not into the 
 I was careful to keep her away from the the fast moving water 
 'cause if she fell in then I'd of been had to go in after her
 And up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now
 And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her 
 but uh this dog Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up 
 and then he he jumped in again 
 and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon 
 He loved it
 Cocoa didn't think too much of it though 
 She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out
 I pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad
 and so but uh she got over it 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I've I live right across the street from a a big lake here um 
 it's on Oneida lake 
 and I'm wondering if uh if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year 
 I've got 
 the yards all fenced in 
 so she doesn't run loose 
 but uh she could go in sometime when if I'm watching her 
 so 
 Oh really
 Yeah
 No 
 no
 Oh really
 Oh okay 
 my my dog last German Shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too 
 And that was the thing I couldn't figure out
 because he would go in the lake 
 it wasn't like he didn't 
 i- 
 normally he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet 
 but if you wanted to get him wet forget it
 Yeah
 Right 
 right 
 obstinate 
 obstinate
 Uh-huh
 I'll have to check it out 
 I saw the the uh previews for it and all 
 and it did look like it'd be a good mo- movie 
 but 
 uh really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately
 But I got to do more more fun things
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Well I'm uh I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force 
 and so I travel a lot
 And yeah 
 I'm a engineer at uh at the laboratory Rolm Laboratory Griffis Air Force Base up here 
 so 
 That's how I got into uh into the switchboard project and all that 
 so 
 But it's nice having a dog here uh 
 the 
 Un- un- uh 
 what's the unrequir- what's the word I'm looking for uh lots of affection no co- unconditional affection from the from the dog
 Yeah 
 yeah
 No 
 no
 Yeah 
 well it's been nice talking to you 
 we seem to be degenerating here 
 so
