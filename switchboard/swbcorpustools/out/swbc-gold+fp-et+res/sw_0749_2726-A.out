 Okay 
 yeah 
 I'm originally from New York 
 and I go visit a lot 
 and their real estate up there is ridiculous absolutely ridiculous
 An apartment here 
 like I live in an apartment 
 and my apartment is three fifteen a month 
 and it's just the one it's a one bedroom 
 Which is still kind of expensive 
 but I prefer to live in uh in a nice part of town because I feel safe here
 And I I I pay more to feel safe you know
 You mean in a one bedroom
 Oh nothing
 Huh-uh 
 just nothing no microwave 
 we've got I have ceiling fan
 I guess that's something
 It's real cute it's got a little vaulted ceiling and mirrored uh mirrored uh 
 *[[ 2 slash units ]] It's Wood uh 
 listen to me I can't even think of the name of my own apartment 
 Woodhollow 
 right next to Village Green 
 it's on 
 yeah 
 kind of far north Waco
 Oh okay 
 yeah 
 far north like on Lake Shore where all those apartments are
 it's right up there 
 so 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 uh-huh 
 that could have been used as 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Um 
 Uh-huh 
 So that looks good when you all get ready to sell you'll probably do really well
 My father used to live in Dallas uh 
 now he he went back to New Jersey 
 we're originally from the East 
 But he 
 oh really 
 he uh well actually right now he lives in Rhode Island 
 he lived in New Jersey for a while now he's in Rhode Island 
 And uh he used to like to go 
 and we used to go just every weekend just to look at houses for no reason we weren't buying one every weekend but just to look at them 
 And so I got a pretty good feel of you know what I want when I do you know get my house whenever that is um 
 What was I going to say about that 
 I completely lost my train of thought Um 
 but we we enjoy going looking at houses 
 and and uh we now 
 I kind of have a good idea of what I want 
 I know I want a big family area
 uh yeah 
 fire a fireplace 
 I saw this awesome house the other weekend 
 it was a great big family room 
 and it was circular 
 and the other side was the patio and the backyard 
 and it had a built in uh grill 
 and every 
 it was it was just an ul- the ultimate party room you know
 I was just going I could have a party in here 
 But that's pretty nice
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 yeah 
 I like a lot of closet space 
 I don't like because 
 I don't like to have a lot of things out you know just all over the place
 I like to have them kind of tucked away
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 My father had uh 
 I keep talking about my father because he owned a house 
 uh he had the kitchen kind of a kitchen and a very long family room
 it's just kind of one room 
 and what he did he put uh a bar right in the center and put some uh a glass rack down so you had like wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar 
 and it just kind of it kind of separated it 
 It was still you know together 
 but it just looked a lot better 
 Because I personally don't like the combination rooms
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'd like a big backyard 
 Oh really 
 A little hot 
 Try to do it early in the mornings 
 Uh-huh 
 Wow 
 Uh-huh 
 well that's good 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 That's true 
 they do throw those up
 Are you all planning to move anytime 
 are you looking for a house or not
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 really
 To find it 
 uh-huh 
 You knew that was it
 Uh-huh 
 I'll probably I'll probably move 
 but I'll probably move to another apartment or something because I'm I'm I'm really uh 
 what's the word 
 I move a lot anyway because the job I have I only work 
 like here I'll be here for like a year 
 and then I'll move off 
 I can move up 
 and so 
 I'm a I'm a news reporter
 I work at Channel Six
 and so this is like my first job 
 so I won't be here very long
 so I'm not even looking to buy anything as permanent as house you know
 so I'm st- staying in an apartment 
 and I'm not married or anything 
 so It's no biggie
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 like I'm amazed at how much stuff I've accumulated in my apartment because up to this point I was in school so I'd go home every summer
 and I could take all my stuff home because I didn't have a bed or a couch or any any of that
 but now I could not move back home 
 And I just realized this you know the other day 
 I'm going wait a minute 
 I can't go back home for the summer or anything I have too much stuff
 So it was just like a weird transition out of home 
 so I have to move in apartments just because I have so much stuff
 No 
 it's not 
 it's not
 Yeah 
 Oh my goodness 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 uh-huh 
 There there are tons of apartments down here 
 and it 
 M C C 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 I I think they're called Lake Shore Villa or something
 Um 
 And it's a nursing 
 there was a nursing home or something right there
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 How often do you all come through Waco
 Uh-huh 
 Depends on what's going on
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 all right 
 You think 
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Um
 Um 
 Waco to me seems seems like it's pretty steady 
 I'm not a real estate person or anything
 but it it's a real college town
 and so you know you have these apartments 
 and then the the houses are all most of the houses are pretty nice
 and I don't I don't you know really see a lot on sale or anything 
 and people are pretty stable here
 You know I kind of see this as kind of a retirement community as I always call it
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Nice and quiet 
 so I don't think I could live here much longer 
 but I'll deal with it
 Well it 
 Yeah
 Really 
 okay well it was very nice talking to you
 Okay 
 you take care
 Okay 
 bye bye
