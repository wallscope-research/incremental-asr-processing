 Okay 
 um so um do you have any favorite teams
 Oh I was going to say you played pro ball
 right
 Not quite huh
 Oh
 Yes 
 I'm actually a Met 
 I'm I'm one of these people who's actually a die hard Mets fan and an avid Yankee hater
 Yeah 
 it's it's 
 I I I find it very strange 
 Um more people 
 you know real Met fans don't like the Yankees
 and real Yankee fans don't like the Mets for some reason
 I never fou- I never quite found a New York fan
 I always found a fan you know of either one or the other 
 and so that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox by default because I went to college also in Boston
 Oh
 Yeah 
 so that so that's sort of close enough
 Oh so you were pretty close 
 Well I don't know Um there's there's a part of me that says that you know um I'm sort of glad Strawberry went away
 You know when when he sort of went away I started thinking yeah well he was performing fairly well 
 but he really wasn't worth the baggage you know
 Um I think they're okay 
 I think they're 
 you know I think they have enough people who are who are who are still in their prime you know
 Um certainly if you look at them compared to let's say you know um eight years ago or something they're they're they're they're you know they're sort of in in good standing whereas you know um <> I think I certainly don't think they're the eighty-six team any more
 Yeah 
 I 
 Right 
 they beat Houston in extra innings 
 and then they actually won the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route um against Boston when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner 
 I felt real bad about that 
 but hey what can you do
 That's right 
 well actually he he he was supposedly um 
 there was there was something wrong with him at the time 
 and I 
 Right 
 and I and I understand that 
 and I say Hey if the guy can't play you don't blame that 
 uh hit it to him 
 you blame the team you know for putting him in
 That's right 
 so 
 So I I I was uh I was also I was in school at Boston at the time
 So I 
 it was actually wonderful because where I was they were half Met fans and um half Sox fans
 Oh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well I guess they were uh I guess they must have been scared after the uh 
 Well that's good 
 well they're Brooklyn boys I guess
 You don't expect them to be uh much of anything but thugs 
 I know I was born there Um
 Yeah 
 I I was I was also born in Brooklyn
 so I can call myself a Brooklyn thug although I'm really not
 Yeah
 Well that that's 
 actually I think I make something because I think 
 and and and in as much as sort of fan support helps
 You know it's good to have um 
 Yes 
 it is kind of small
 Right
 Oh that's great 
 So 
 Yeah 
 that'll be nice 
 that that I think tends to keep 
 I think stadiums work tend to keep people happy
 Yeah 
 exactly
 Uh I haven't been to any Toronto games yet 
 But um 
 Of stadiums yeah 
 well to get up there 
 the the best I've been up here so far you know up in up state New York is uh is um Rochester Red Wings game
 Oh Cornell is in Ithaca
 Uh yeah 
 so Cornell is about um somewhere uh about two and a half hours south of south and east of us
 So if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of 
 Yeah 
 we're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario
 Actually whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn't be a port city
 Um but they 
 Oh really I ne- I hadn't actually known that
 Well um but we have our own um our own triple A team here
 the Redwings which are they're a farm team for the Orioles
 So everybody hopes that uh they go all the way around here 
 There's the 
 they're the big team in Rochester
 Oh yeah 
 I 
 actually we we we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they're fun
 Lots of really big 
 you know lots of local fans you know small stadium you know um 
 and they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes you know
 um especially 
 you know I'll make a day game or something 
 But they really seem to uh 
 people really get into it 
 [ I can't + I I again I can't make any predictions about them 
 but I suspect they'll go uh they'll go fly Yeah 
 Those are those are uh I think those are more fun than major league games sometimes
 Yes 
 it's true
 One of the advantages of not having pitchers who are 
 uh uh you know I guess I guess when you start pitching real well well move them up Bam 
 Yeah 
 but um 
 Well the way I the way I see it is 
 um you know I can use a Met analogy here
 If you'll think back a few years to when the Mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren't very sort of well trained
 you know back to you know maybe eighty eighty-four or eighty-three or eighty-five you know when they were first when they weren't quite the eighty-six team that that that they were
 I I 
 that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year [ I think + if I think + the young talent really just has to build itself up
 Right 
 but 
 Oh that must be nice
 Well that isn't too bad Just a couple of hours
 Yeah 
 well it takes me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium
 So I don't know
 Yeah 
 well actually we can we can I can take a highway the whole way down 
 but it's still it's some it's it's almost four hundred hou- 
 it's almost four hundred 
 you know barring traffic it's four hundred hours 
 four hundred mil- 
 four hundred hours 
 right 
 four hundred miles barring traffic 
 so it's um it's it's you know it's a heck of a drive 
 We are substantially north of New York enough that uh we don't get to go play too often
 Toronto
 Oh Toronto's only about two hours 
 yeah
 Toronto I want to go see
 Um I can 
 I've actually I've driven 
 but I've heard about the ferry as well
 Haven't taken it yet though 
 Have you taken it
 Yeah 
 um I I really love 
 I think that's one of the most uh enjoyable things about being up here 
 I'm only up here for school
 Uh no 
 probably south maybe Texas 
 Some place south and warm 
 I don't 
 I'm not a big uh I'm not a big uh cold fan
 Uh right now we're actually having uh 
 it's getting nice 
 it was in the high fifties today 
 but three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm 
 Oh that's great 
 You know about that same time branches were falling off everywhere 
 and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks
 Because it didn't make the nat- national news too much which I find really weird
 but um we were um 
 you know all schools were closed for almost for over for a week
 There were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive
 Yeah 
 because they had so many power lines down
 and so many uh things like that 
 so they were
