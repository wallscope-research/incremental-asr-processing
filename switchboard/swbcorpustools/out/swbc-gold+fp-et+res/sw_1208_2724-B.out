 Uh so what do you do to exercise
 Uh-huh
 Um
 That's pretty impressive 
 Uh I guess I bicycle 
 Uh the amount varies 
 as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week
 Uh I guess a play softball one night a week 
 And I backpack a lot over the summer
 Yeah 
 that's that's about the extent of it 
 I don't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise 
 But uh I guess the bicycling is the one thing I'll sort of like do if I feel like I need to go exercise 
 Uh but I do it mostly for fun
 It it it varies 
 Uh out near my house is pretty hilly 
 Uh but sometimes I bike to work which is about uh a fifteen mile trip each way 
 And that's mostly flat
 Uh about forty-five fifty minutes
 Yeah 
 it can be a pain 
 Uh basically uh I work on a campus 
 so I can store my bike in my office and walk across the uh campus to the uh gym use the shower there
 uh but it's it's enough of a pain that I did it consistently one year 
 I would commute every day uh 
 but it just became such a pain 
 we're talking you know forty-five fifty minutes for biking uh and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind And then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff 
 It was a big hunk hunk of the day 
 Uh and then of course another hour to get back home 
 Uh so I've been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when I get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends
 Not so much 
 Uh I guess mostly I bike on my own 
 I've got a touring bike Uh though I haven't gone on any extended trips with it 
 How about you 
 what kind of biking do you do
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Oh I see
 Uh-huh
 It's good to have a partner
 Are you think of doing any like centuries or 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like you know uh uh touring like from Vermont or you know that kind of thing 
 I mean people seem to get into different aspects 
 One is more of a distance 
 and one's more just you know 
 they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Oh that's nice
 Um
 Wow
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'm not sure why that is 
 generally in the Midwest it seems to be less much less 
 maybe it's because of the winters Uh or maybe just because you know there's there's a lot more flat lands you know out in the West
 So it makes biking a better alternative for transportation
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Oh that's terrific
 Uh-huh
 Oh I guess as an adult for just about the past uh three years or so 
 Uh you know I guess last time I did it before that was college which was about ten years ago
 And uh yeah 
 I guess I just never really thought about it much for a while uh until I suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot 
 And so I thought I'd try it too
 No 
 I haven't 
 no
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's great
 Yeah 
 I've I've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse 
 You know it gets it down to about forty
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 On average 
 yeah
 No 
 I'm not that hard-core 
 there are some people 
 in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow 
 They've got a uh mountain bike you know with the big knobby tires
 And I don't do that 
 I basically I I pretty much lay off for the winter 
 Uh I was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter you know because it will help your balance when you're indoor training
 Uh but I just you know more or less stocked like an exercise bike and that kind of thing uh 
 but yeah 
 winters are kind of a problem 
 so I'm more or less out of shape now that I've been biking I guess this year for just a couple of weeks 
 Uh but you know up here it's only stopped snowing since then
 Uh but yeah 
 it's it's it's it's pretty good 
 It's uh 
 the main the main thing I guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like you know exercise and a chore I'll lay off it more
 Oh yeah 
 yeah 
 I try to go someplace pretty different you know every week 
 I rotate around uh about four different routes uh from my house 
 or I'll sometimes come in the school 
 It's nice coming 
 it's it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path uh 
 because it's just it's along the Erie Canal up here
 Uh University of Rochester
 So it's fairly picturesque
 And uh so it's it's it's a good ride 
 as long as you're not doing it every day it's a good ride 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh it was good talking to you
 Okay 
 you too
 Bye
