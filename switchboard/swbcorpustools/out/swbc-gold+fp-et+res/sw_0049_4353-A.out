 Huh 
 Do you all have a budget
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It's uh 
 Yeah 
 I usually uh 
 my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances 
 and of course we're ju- like ther- like a lot of people 
 We just scramble through month to month you know
 And uh 
 Uh we have a two income uh family 
 She also works
 and uh but she she enjoys it 
 and she's good at it 
 Uh if it's if it's 
 I am kind of uh uh I'm pretty bad about procrastinating
 and one of these days I am going to do something about that I believe 
 You know how that goes 
 but uh uh if she she handles it pretty well 
 She uh she writes all the checks you know once a month
 Uh sort of on a peripheral 
 She's uh uh an annuity administrator
 and so she uh she works for an insurance company
 But but she enjoys it 
 She likes keeping track of all that stuff 
 and uh 
 Yeah 
 sort of
 And we you know we've experimented with with uh budgets you know from time to time uh 
 but if you know 
 you have to keep up with them 
 So a lot of times we just uh just kind of play it by ear 
 We try to keep our uh our retirement and our savings kind of automated
 so we never see that money 
 Just like taken directly 
 Yeah 
 And that that's kind of handy 
 Yeah 
 because if you don't see it you don't miss it 
 You don't spend it 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do 
 Just kind of play it by ear but keep the the deductions you know 
 Uh-huh
