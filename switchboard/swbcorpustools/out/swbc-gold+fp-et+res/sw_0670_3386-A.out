 Well I don't know if I really have a a lot of uh requirements 
 Uh I guess I look at uh getting the best deal
 Uh that's my main objectives normally Whoever is willing to deal and and give me a good price
 <> Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I don't know I've had pretty good luck you know 
 even if if you take any car and and you care for it well enough uh you are going to get some good life out of it 
 Uh my my Oldsmobile right now that I have uh is getting near eighty thousand 
 and it's still in pretty good shape 
 Uh there was a flaw in there where a where a head gasket bolt broke 
 and it cost me some bucks to to fix that 
 but that was you know something that was unforeseen 
 But I still think I c- I'm going to get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it
 Well I I drive like the song says THE LITTLE OLD LADY but uh but not FROM PASADENA
 But uh 
 yeah 
 I I baby them as much as I possibly can 
 Uh it's a pretty big expense nowadays 
 Uh and I guess I like to take care of it uh 
 so I don't have to buy one too often
 Yeah 
 I I I got an old uh seventy-six uh Grand Fury that uh doesn't want to die on me 
 so I I just keep running the thing Don't want to sell it or get rid of it until it quits 
 but it just doesn't seem to want to 
 I'll probably have uh three four hundred thousand before it wants to die
 Oh I've got the big three sixty in there gas guzzler 
 but it runs good
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well I'm considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle 
 Uh I just have so many hauling projects a lot of times 
 and uh I I'd like to just start doing some uh carpentry uh type work around 
 I just feel that
