 All right 
 Well I am uh the product of uh I think as much the changing roles of women as anyone 
 my mother uh 
 we come from a 
 my mother and I were uh really prac- first generation divorce in our family
 My uh mother was divorced in nineteen uh fifty-seven when I was seven years old
 And was I was the first one of anyone that that anyone had ever known to have a divorce
 Of course now fifty percent divorces in the United States uh 
 my mother uh was treated very badly uh in a by a lot of people family members um especially from my father's side of the family 
 and also uh uh uh we were uh ostracized by his family uh basically just you know uh we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth
 And they all felt that th- there was never an issue that my father was the was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce
 Uh it was always my mother's fault she was not uh sufficient you know she just was not good enough 
 What was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest 
 It was that kind of an attitude
 So uh 
 yeah 
 it was too bad 
 it was really rough
 Uh so {D you know that's so changing 
 some of the changing roles of women in that respect I have been a product of
 Um I think that there are people that I think that uh 
 I was a- I was first generation going to college in my family
 Uh first my mother had always had a quote career but always a career as a uh uh in a secretarial position 
 She did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial pro- profession in Des Moines Iowa
 She was a secretary to + uh uh the jud- to uh a circuit court judge federal judge 
 And it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him 
 So that was a really high high status position
 She made over thirty thousand a year 
 Well yeah 
 she a real hard la- 
 Yeah
 hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back you know
 But uh so I went to college and now since have completed two masters degrees 
 and I am the director of music in a church 
 Um and but it's interestingly enough I am still everyday confronted with 
 Absolutely
 Challenges that have to do with my sex
 Uh for instance uh well you know I am just not taken as seriously you know at professions as many of the wom- as many of the men who are doing the same job I do 
 And uh the choir members treat me differently because I am a woman they expect me to be more motherly 
 they question my authority more uh than they ever would a man 
 And I have experience with this because I work at both both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man
 So I am pretty I am pretty ob- pretty cons- I am pretty aware of what goes on uh in the church 
 So basically that's that's 
 well I am done talking 
 Do you want to talk 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh always
 Uh-huh
 Indeed
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend why they can not just accept you know competent women 
 I I have never been able to understand that 
 I guess it's fear 
 what 
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Men have a lot of trouble with that though
 They in their in their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal 
 and so it's really difficult for them to treat women as equals 
 They are they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower 
 Uh it just seems that it seems it seems that they are more comfortable that way 
 And I do not know if that's that's it's a militaristic point of view I guess you know 
 somebody can not be colonel 
 and everybody else is infantry 
 but it's just really interesting to me 
 I am married to a wonderful man you know who treats me very you know with a with as 
 I think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time 
 But when he gets angry it's always over control issues it's always over power issues it's never over you know it's always you said you were going to do something 
 and you did not do it As if he is the boss 
 and I am the you know and I am the slave
 And it 
 those are the only only issues we ever fight about 
 I think it's just I think it's just difficult for men to uh to accept women equally 
 even if they want to they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss 
 Uh dictator dictatorships are real efficient
 Um
 Um
 Um
 Um
 Huh
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's true
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 it would be
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
