 Okay 
 all set then 
 Uh what do you think about it
 Uh-huh
 Oh I didn't realize that
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 that's right 
 I have heard 
 uh I don't remember what they call it sort of like a positive negatives or some some kind of word they use when a uh you get a uh a positive indication of drugs 
 but there's not really there weren't really any there
 Uh every now and then there's an error 
 and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated
 Yeah 
 I I work here at Texas Instruments 
 so uh we we do a let me think do we yeah everyone coming in 
 I guess I did three years ago
 Everyone coming in uh goes through the drug testing procedure 
 and they talk about it as a you know as as better for the country and better for the working conditions 
 So if they uh they test for drugs 
 I I'm I can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore 
 I know we did in the military 
 but I don't know if once your in they continue to do it 
 but I guess you're always on call for it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 B- 
 Uh-huh 
 right
 So your big beef with it is the uh 
 Is is it's a good idea 
 but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better
 Make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever 
 Yeah 
 I I I tend to agree with you David 
 Yeah 
 my brother uh brother used to work for Wal-Mart 
 and then I don't know if he still does or what because I don't know if Sam's is actually part of it 
 but he you know is working at Sam's now
 Okay 
 yeah 
 then he's been working for the company for a while too 
 He uh 
 Good company uh
 You all uh have some 
 he's telling me about good profit sharing and all that 
 so 
 It's good news 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's what my brother was telling me 
 That's good good new- good deal 
 Well uh how long were we s- 
 I haven't done this in a couple months 
 How long were we supposed to discuss for
 Okay 
 we got a couple more minutes then I guess 
 Uh think what else I can say about that Uh
 Right 
 uh everyone coming in gets goes through the drug test
 Uh no 
 well let me think about that 
 Yeah 
 it was after I w- I had already been hired Uh
 Yeah 
 you get hired then you come in the first 
 I 
 seems to me I remember that uh I was hired came in and went through some orientation 
 and I thought I 
 boy I can't remember 
 That would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test 
 Maybe it was during the interview 
 I came up a couple times for an interview 
 so it's hard for me to remember where I was when all that happened 
 But uh I guess just like other companies other friends I've been hearing about that have been moving around 
 it's it's before 
 They have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment 
 so I'm sure that happened to me too
 What what about oh 
 they just instituted it there at Wal-Mart
 so 
 Right
