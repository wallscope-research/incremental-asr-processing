 Yeah 
 Yes 
 I talked with um I talked with people from Richardson and Plano 
 and uh the first three days 
 and then yesterday I talked with someone with from Pennsylvania 
 so 
 it's the 
 Oh
 Oh I know 
 Sometimes I just 
 I'm in 
 it just takes a very long time 
 so 
 Yeah 
 I know 
 Well
 This is hilarious 
 Oh Well tell me what books have you read lately 
 Well I don't read all that much for enjoyment 
 I read a lot for school 
 but gee I just don't have much time for enjoyment reading 
 Uh-huh 
 Um
 Yeah
 Huh
 Oh yeah
 Oh yeah
 Interesting
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 yes 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 That kind of was um kind of a pop psychology time for wh- when a lot of books like that were coming out I think
 And so that makes real sense that that's um when it was written
 Um I haven't wasn't really aware that she had written anything for um adults 
 I was always just more aware of her jer- you know 
 for her young people her books 
 *[[one utt]] Uh-huh
 I'll be darned
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I wonder if she's written anything really recently if she's got anything printed in print 
 Uh-huh
 I'll be darned
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well it's 
 I'm trying to think the last actual book I read that wasn't 
 let's see I think I read oh 
 when I was on vacation um between semester break and summer you know on semester break between spring and summer 
 and I went to my mother's 
 I read a book that I have should have read when I was probably in high school 
 I read um JANE EYRE
 No 
 wait a minute 
 wait a minute 
 wait a minute 
 JANE EYRE 
 No 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 it wasn't JANE EYRE
 No 
 it was um uh PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen
 That's what it was 
 yes
 And um you know I I didn't know what to expect except I had heard that that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist 
 and she really was good 
 I was was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so intricately 
 and um and you know I just 
 but I as I say I was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then
 *[[slash error]] Uh-huh 
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh how interesting
 Yeah
 Oh I'll bet 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Right 
 I wouldn't be surprised 
 yeah
 Sure 
 Oh yeah
 Well I read that 
 and then I'm trying to think um 
 usually I try to to find something long that I'm going to 
 when 
 if if I have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or you know when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while um
 Yeah 
 and that's about it because otherwise I'm reading so much for school 
 I'm um I have just started reading a book 
 Actually it's for school 
 but it's for um 
 there's a a literary jour- 
 well not a literary journal 
 it's a it's kind of a journal of of the history of ideas that's that's starting to be published um from U T D 
 The first issue doesn't come out until next year 
 but um 
 I'm doing some reviews of books just to what to sort of recommend to wh- whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal
 and I've 
 yeah 
 it's really neat because these are brand new books 
 and I just got a I got a th- this one 
 um most of the stuff is on uh literary criticism and philosophy and religion and all that
 This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach 
 and it's a a a biography that is really interesting
 it it's fascinating 
 it really is
 Um but it's so long 
 I I don't really have the time to read the whole thing 
 but I think eventually I'll go back to it 
 But it's it was written 
 the the copyright is nineteen ninety-one 
 so it's a brand new book
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 and he really this man really shed some light on um some aspects of of Bach's genius and and and + you know the and more sociological things you know like the the idea that um that music to be a musician was as much um of a family occupation as anything 
 you know that was it was families had just loads of musicians 
 Yeah 
 that's right 
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 and um 
 Yeah 
 So uh 
 it was just really interesting 
 if that's you know that's kind of what 
 but I have to 
 not only am am I re- reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also um because the board of advisers for this um journal doesn't have right now doesn't have a really respected name um who's a uh a scholar on on music
 um and I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be a you know in that position on the board 
 so 
 I don't know if I want to take that responsibility or not 
 but But at least I can tell them what I think 
 so um it's real interesting
 Yeah 
 it is
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 that it 
 you know you see you see a lot of small colleges doing things like that 
 right 
 uh-huh
 because it attracts really a a lot people's interest 
 That's one way 
 it's really good public relations for small schools
 I think so 
 But uh another one of my projects this summer is actually it's part of my research assistantship is um it's helping a professor uh compile a bunch of translations of of various poems for a book that he's writing 
 and so I'm learning the names if not the actual contents of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people
 Um well where where for instance um a Baudelaire poem that was written in the French and then has been translated into English by various people
 And the translations are all so different from one another
 Uh-huh
 So it's multiple translations of single works 
 and and that's right now right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as um 
 my work is just kind of compiling all that for him 
 So 
 It's real interesting
 *[[slash error]] *[[slash error should be 'x']] Oh well let me tell you *[[slash error]] There are days when I would be prefer really doing that 
 I don't know if I've told you 
 but um this is not on the subject
