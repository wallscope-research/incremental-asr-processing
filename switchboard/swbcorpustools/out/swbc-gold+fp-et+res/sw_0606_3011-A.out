 Yes 
 I live in Dallas
 Yeah 
 I think right now it's it's kind of bad Uh 
 I don't live in a house 
 I live in an apartment 
 Are are you in a house
 Okay
 Uh-huh 
 Well I guess the best I can do is is uh compare apartments 
 If it can compare the one that I have now with the one that I had the last time the one that I have now uh has a lot more amenities I guess is the right word than the one that I moved out of 
 Uh this one you know gave us free cable and uh ceiling fans 
 and uh it was practically new when I moved in here 
 and the carpet was new 
 and 
 No 
 it's not a high-rise 
 It's just a a two story building
 Uh but there's you know there there are a lot of buildings 
 but it's just two stories 
 Uh on the second floor they have they don't have a patio 
 but they have a sunroom instead of the patio 
 On the first floor um where I am there's a patio
 Yeah
 The rooms are nice and large 
 and let's see I have I have two bedrooms 
 And uh 
 Well I I I have a washer and dryer area 
 and I I did buy the washer and dryer 
 but they didn't provide it
 The one that I moved from didn't didn't have a place to put them 
 and that's one of the reasons that I did move
 Yeah
 Get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat 
 So tell me ab- 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 It just It's a real good 
 Yeah 
 it's a good time to buy if you're in the market
 Uh-huh
 Oh so you want a bigger one
 Uh-huh 
 One thing about the houses in uh in Dallas they don't uh utilize basements the way they did in New York
 My parents in New York had uh a uh three family house
 Actual a 
 two family house where the the um the downstairs and the second floor they had 
 and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment you know
 And uh they had a basement
 and they you know they finished the basement 
 and they were able to rent that out also 
 But uh in Dallas I I just I just haven't seen basements in houses
 And I've looked at a lot of them <> you know 
 No 
 it's a- 
 Right
 I haven't I haven't I have yet to see a basement in a house
 And uh 
 Well no 
 No 
 no 
 no 
 you know I don't see that kind of sand here Um 
 there are some areas though where where they have a problem with uh the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the to the uh 
 the foundation is sinking or something You know just a little just a little bit some more than others 
 But you you have to know the right spot to to pick where that doesn't happen
 And <> uh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I see
 Huh 
 Where did you say you're at Colorado
 Virginia 
 Virginia 
 That's right 
 Anywhere near uh Virginia Beach
 <> Oh
 Uh-huh 
 Well different areas in Dallas have different kind 
 in uh in Texas I'll say 
 because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay
 And uh in the in the Dallas you know Fort Worth city areas you don't see that
 Yeah 
 well 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Huh
 Well 
 I see
 <> Uh-huh
 So is your house in an area by itself 
 
 it's not connected to another one
 Oh
 But it's not they're not connected are they
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
