 Do you like to cook
 I do too
 It it's kind of hard to find time sometimes 
 but 
 Yes
 Uh I don't have a family 
 but I I usually work about fifty hours a week 
 and by the time I get home I'm so tired it's hard to cook a full meal
 That's that's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party mine is is a is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce
 so Where did you get your recipe for it
 Oh okay 
 Well mine actually came from the um Texas Instruments Cafeteria
 They they 
 Yeah 
 we have 
 it's in Johnson City
 And um the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes you know like once a month 
 they'll put out a recipe of the month
 And they they put this one out 
 and I tried it 
 and it was really good
 Yeah 
 a little bit sweeter
 And it uh it's a it's a red wine
 And uh I'm trying to think what else 
 I I roll it in bread crumbs and uh Parmesan cheese
 and then I rub it with a little bit I rub the chicken with a little bit of oil and pour the wine sauce over it as like the last twenty minutes so that it gets just enough flavor
 Right
 And it's really easy too 
 so 
 What do you use 
 Huh
 I like to serve um a wild rice with it
 This is really neat
 And I 
 we're big broccoli fans
 Well I just I just don't think you can go wrong with something like that
 Oh what
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 What time should we be there 
 That sounds wonderful 
 I love desserts 
 but since there's only two of us it's really 
 I I try to avoid making anything that too fancy that we'd like too much and eat too much 
 But I I guess one that that I really like that I haven't made in awhile 
 and it's it's called a fruit pizza
 And you take a uh sugar cookie uh recipe and and spread it out on a pizza pan 
 So you make it like a pizza crust 
 and then you you bake that 
 and then you um take things like kiwi and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want 
 and you mix that with um you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice 
 and I can't remember what else is in it 
 and you make kind of a glaze
 and then you layer your fresh fruit on that
 Yeah
 It is really good 
 and it it's real light 
 and it 
 depending on the fruit you use it's you know it's real colorful
 Especially with like the kiwi and the strawberries
 So but usually I just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's just so much better for you
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 That sounds great
 No 
 and that's some- that's something that just you know it doesn't take a long time to fix
 it's really good 
 and it's really good for you
 And we eat out a lot 
 and there are sometimes you just don't feel like eating out
 and I wish I had something a little bit different to just <> zap together
 Uh-huh
 I was going to say do you just mix it to taste
 Okay
 How long does it keep 
 do you well 
 you wouldn't have to make 
 Yeah 
 and you wouldn't have to mix that much together even
 I'm sorry I keep coughing 
 I've had a bad cold
 Plain 
 Plain yogurt 
 I'll bet that is really good
 Man 
 I'm going to have to think of that 
 We're getting company tonight
 and I have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian
 So we're going to 
 I think we'll try to do something a little bit 
 we might try to to um to grill some flounder or salmon steaks
 Yeah
 And I usually 
 when they come down I'll grill those and brush on a little lemon butter sauce 
 and um definitely go with it will have to be a rice dish lots of vegetables to make up for the lack of meat
 No 
 we don't 
 our next door neighbors do 
 and some a lot of times they'll give us something
 Yeah
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 That's what I was just thinking 
 it doesn't sound like it it would be hard at all
 where did you get 
 where did you get this cook book
 Really
 I'll might have to visit the State Book Store
 I haven't either
 Okay 
 Well the ones that I've been I've been wanting to get um 
 I guess you've seen the THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE WAYS TO COOK CHICKEN and the THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE WAYS TO COOK PASTA
 I've been I've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken
 and we do eat a lot of pasta
 So we we just said the other night it wouldn't be too difficult to be to do without red meat
 You know we don't have that much of it now 
 As long as we have plenty of vegetables and lots of chicken
 Yeah 
 I've got a I've got a Wok that we don't use near as often as we used to
 We used to stir fry a lot especially um a lot of chicken and and a lot of rice dishes
 Yeah 
 But usually if I'm if I'm if I take a day off or on the weekend especially I try to cook real real food
 And at least cook a couple of dishes ahead
 So that we can have those to enjoy
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 Cause we have some some local ones
 And we have a share alike column in the paper where people you know write in and share recipes or write in and say I'm looking for this recipe
 and that's where I get a lot of my recipes
 Yes 
 And I got I got a real good one from a doctor's office one time
 It's uh it's a baked bean recipe
 And you mix baked beans and Lima beans 
 and uh let's see I guess 
 Yeah 
 Just mix the canned beans together and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup you know
 and and you just bake it 
 And it's just it's like a a spicier baked bean dish
 And you can add hamburger if you want to give it a little more body 
 So I I try to always keep my eyes open and because a lot of time you can find find really good recipes where you wouldn't even think about it
 So I try to always keep a little notebook in my purse
 But it's been
