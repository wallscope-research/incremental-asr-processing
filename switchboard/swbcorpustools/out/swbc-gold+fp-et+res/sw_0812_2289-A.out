 Okay 
 we we can uh be recorded while we talk about it
 No 
 we don't have mandatory 
 We actually we're kind of slow up here
 and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer 
 And it's all voluntary 
 So that's interesting 
 Cities have a mandatory recycling
 Yeah 
 when I was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing 
 We got like a penny a pound for them
 Oh my
 Oh I didn't realize 
 you would think 
 now up here I I suppose they send it all back to the mill 
 and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of uh 
 Actually there is one in northern Vermont 
 So there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here 
 I didn't think that 
 you know in the large city that if the next recycling if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it's a lot of money to transport
 Do you have to buy metal 
 like copper is a very good one to collect 
 Even aluminum 
 yeah 
 so 
 Uh we do the recycling 
 and our city will pick up our recyclables
 They have these little blue bins 
 Um I don't recycle personally 
 I I'm saying I want to do it 
 but I don't get a lot of magazines 
 I don't get a 
 I don't buy the newspaper 
 but I do have a lot of uh 
 my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of cart- a lot of different papers and cardboards
 Yes 
 but we have a bottle return 
 A lot of the northern states and a lot of the Eastern states have bottles 
 We've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years
 Oh they should definitely get um the nickel returnable 
 It's great for the kids because 
 see a lot of the kids get the money from it
 and it's great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes
 Yeah
 And recycle
 Oh yes 
 I see that
 But it takes away employment from the resource
 and its 
 I do too
 They don't either 
 Yeah 
 like I say it's not a very controversial thing 
 Everyone thinks we should do it 
 It's just that we're so lazy 
 like personally I don't want to clean my 
 I just have can cat food 
 I don't want to clean the can and take the label off it and put it in a separate bin
 You know I'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash
 Yeah 
 I think I would be like 
 when I bring my bottles back If they're pretty clean and stuff so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months 
 and I get a whole bunch of them and bring them ov- and bring them over 
 Now if I had a recycling center and I kept it clean like if I washed all the cans and things I wouldn't mind if it sat around too much 
 but if if it stunk or something I wouldn't like doing it 
 But um I produce quite a bit of trash 
 my you know house 
 and I see it 
 but I don't see so much that I can recycle
 Like I say it's a lot of different type paper and cardboard 
 I'm not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper um pretty much 
 and I don't know how they sort that 
 But if if I used a lot of can goods and I do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles I would think that I wou- I would have a recycling center 
 But now it's just me and my husband 
 so I don't know
 Yeah 
 I know what you're saying 
 But we have we have a very aggressive recycling at work 
 and I'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin 
 See some people it's the recycle bin is on their way out 
 Instead of carrying your newspapers when they get done with them at the end of the day they throw them in the trash
 Um no 
 we don't 
 but other other offices do 
 They have a box for papers
 Yeah
 Oh
 Well that's that's a really good idea because um like our uh fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit
 And they're thinking about putting a deposit on them because pretty much you have to you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they're so much easier just to put a deposit on it because most probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because they're beer and soda
 but when they sell juice it's some strange quirk in the law you don't have to have a deposit on it 
 And even like the a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it 
 but if it's got soda in it it does 
 So it's a strange
 Yeah 
 they should they should clean clear that up 
 It wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on the uh juice cans as easily as the soda
 So but redemption centers are a big thing up here 
 they get a penny a can they handle 
 They give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor 
 I think they either get a penny or two pennies a can
 Yeah
 Is bot- is bottle return down there a heated debate
 Oh yeah
 Well we 
 well here you can't drink
 Well
 Yes 
 well I know I was in Atlanta 
 and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand 
 But here Let me put that in a paper cup for you
 So that was strange 
 But I think 
 if some people they have 
 they say well we're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these um the the recycle center you have to deal with the can and then you have to to recycle it 
 and their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits see how they handle it 
 and see if it's a good way 
 and then do it that way Because as like I say people are making money on it
 The cans do are worth something
