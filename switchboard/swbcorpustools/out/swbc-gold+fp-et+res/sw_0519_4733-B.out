 Uh do you have children in school 
 Uh I have two that are uh now just about ready to graduate from college
 but I also have two that are just entering school 
 Uh *[[needs slash]] Uh well *[[sv]] I think they're just pushing them mu- entirely to fast
 Uh well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade
 My son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock
 And I think that's such a long day for a kindergartner 
 And uh I have a preschooler 
 Uh I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten 
 and I thought well how mature do you have to be 
 And uh there is a 
 do you have the standardized testing now
 Yeah 
 No 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 you would like to know what they're doing right 
 Oh me 
 Well that makes it hard for you doesn't it 
 Oh me
 Yeah 
 It's hard to explain to them why you can't 
 Right
 Oh dear
 Right 
 Right 
 How about the kids 
 How are they coping with it
 Huh Right
 Yeah 
 Rather than anticipating 
 Oh it is
 That's right 
 My son said that came home 
 and he said he said Mom all we do is work
 We hardly ever play 
 and 
 Oh likewise
 Right 
 Wouldn't that be great 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Is that right 
 Oh my gosh 
 Oh my gosh
 Well for example in my son's kindergarten They're really finished at lunch time 
 After lunch they have some uh 
 I'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch 
 and then they have naps or rest period
 And uh I think either send them home or do something a little more interesting 
 I agree
 I wouldn't be surprised
 I doubt if they would say it was too long 
 Uh do you have the before school care at your school and the after school care
