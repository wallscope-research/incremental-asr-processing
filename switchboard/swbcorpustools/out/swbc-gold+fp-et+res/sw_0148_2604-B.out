 Right 
 Uh who wants to start this one
 Right 
 right
 I'm not sure I want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision 
 Uh that that doesn't sound right 
 Um I guess I see overall beneficial if if we're going from that point of view
 Um I- you know in the past 
 I don't know I don't know how old you are 
 but when I was uh in high school it was the beginning of Vietnam and so forth 
 And many of my peers were being drafted
 And I could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever 
 But I I felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that they could help the country in other ways Be it cleaning out uh lots in in their neighborhood or whatever kind of community or public service might be available 
 And I guess I see that as as not so much a demand but but a privilege 
 It's it's kind of uh uh It's something 
 it's it's 
 since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between uh there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest I just see that as maybe a good idea 
 I wouldn't mind doing it at forty-four
 Uh and I find ways to to turn some of that back to to others 
 Uh and I I guess I I can't see that as being something to really object to
 I could see a a full a run- a gamut of different kinds of opportunities 
 Things that need to be done that wou- that could be done in an hour or two uh a day or several hours of the week Like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that In addition to what one does uh besides that 
 I I can't imagine what kind of uh uh bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time 
 oh you're going to go to this camp 
 and you're going to you know 
 like um back in the Depression the C C C the construction corps that went out and did things That was great 
 *[[ Why isn't "That was great" an independent slash unit ]] it was needed 
 it gave some folks some jobs 
 and we got some great public works out of it 
 But um I don't see that as being necessary now 
 I can see it being done uh on a regular schedule
 Uh everybody has to put in so many hours of uh public service in a given time perhaps
 Uh I I guess I see all of us benefiting 
 and I I don't see it just relegated to the young 
 But I see I I see so much going on that that's bad 
 And this would give them a chance to have some positive self-esteem
 Something that they turn back
 That's right
 You take pride in that and and get some some positive feedback from those who benefit besides yourself 
 And I I see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where at least the area where the person lives
 It might not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county because then you're you're coming in contact with it 
 It's not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there that I'll never be able to see again unless I happen to go on vacation up there
 It's it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual on going
 But as far as putting that into work I don't want to I don't want to deal with the with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics of it
 Yeah
 I I see a lot of things like uh scouting uh Boys Clubs Girls Clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship uh the uh looking after the environment sort of thing
 And I guess I don't see uh this being that different But even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in and would take a turn in
 Do you have kids
 Oh well good 
 Th- you'll have a little time think about that 
 I guess I I have uh 
 when I was teaching school I saw many so many kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose 
 And I can see you know some some really significant things coming out of it
 I know you've got to get past that that grudge attitude that many have 
 but that's uh tha- that would be a part of selling it to the community
 The adults uh ahead of it would probably never serve and and to each succeeding generation There definitely would have to be a major P R campaign in each community each county *[[ This is clearly 2 slash units Why wasn't it parsed that way ]] uh parish or however the state was divided up 
 Um I may 
 well I don't know 
 around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for 
 Boy Scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will uh police a uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee- 
 and I I've seen it in other states too
 I don't know
 um
 and there were those ] that said No 
 you can't do that I'm sure
 Yeah
 Oh 
 And I hadn't even thought about that uh the the other end of that 
 That that's an interesting uh situation 
 I hadn't thought of that 
 We had visited relatives in Virginia not too long ago 
 and I thought I had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up 
 and 
 And I don't know about your part of the country 
 but uh down here in the last oh year plus I it was las- beginning with last year's Earth Day There's just been more of a turn toward uh environmental concerns 
 and e- I work for Texas Instruments
 And they they've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said Well it's not feasible
 it's not a good idea 
 And I see that as being I I see that as being a a a change uh for the positive Kind of along the same line as as as the mandatory thing 
 It's just thing a part of everyone's consciousness
 I'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way 
 Uh there have been too many other things that it's done that for just in my life 
 And if you look at history at all you see that you know uh we go from one side to the other on just about any subject that you one might care to bring up 
 But it is comforting to me to see uh more concern about some of these things that that cost us money 
 Especially when we have dwindling uh resources such as oil that's burning out of control in the Persian Gulf and and so forth 
 Just just every little bit does 
 it makes me feel better 
 It it makes me feel like well there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth
 That's that's right because 
 Uh no 
 no 
 because if we 
 what was it seventy-four when we had the the last last oil crisis 
 And uh we started getting smart 
 and and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth
 And as soon as the oil prices came back down we the pendulum swang the other way
 And we need those reminders
 Uh or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say Oh my goodness now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology
 Ah
 Well I thi- you know 
 just about anybody you could name whether I voted for them or not uh makes um uh decisions that I just can't go along with 
 But that's why they're there and not me 
 I don't want the I don't want the stress
