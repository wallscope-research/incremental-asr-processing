 Okay 
 Did you want me to go ahead
 Okay 
 Well one thing 
 I I guess both of us are very much aware of the equality 
 Uh it seems like women are uh just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in uh jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did 
 Uh it's not uncommon to see men doing dishes making supper or taking care of the kids 
 or som- uh 
 the generation of my parents and my great grandmother which uh they did everything 
 They went to work 
 and they took care of the family 
 so 
 Exactly
 Exactly 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's the way my husband is too 
 it it doesn't uh doesn't bother him at all to do the dishes
 It doesn't bother h- him at all to do the laundry verses uh men from way back 
 There is that 
 well if you did that you were henpecked or whatever 
 But men are starting 
 Yeah 
 those are very few 
 I think those men don't last very long in relationships because I think women know what they want
 Right 
 exactly
 And it's it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything uh you know and then kind of real light pay 
 There's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all 
 So it's it's kind of a uh neat thing to see as far as equality in the households 
 and I think that's even going to get better Even you know even more so 
 I think it's just going to be where men will do as much cleaning as women do and that it won't be your job description instead of your role definition is this 
 It will be uh 
 hopefully for my daughter who I instill into it doesn't matter if you want to drive a truck honey 
 or it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse 
 it doesn't matter if you want to be uh the President 
 or it doesn't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor 
 it doesn't matter 
 It's what you want to be 
 So I have always instilled into her 
 and I think mothers um are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say hey you don't have to stay with nursing 
 you don't have to be a secretary 
 you don't have to be 
 you can be whatever you want to be Whether it be a welder or trucker or whatever As long as you uh go to school for it and get the education 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 If they want to right
 Uh-huh
 I do too
 You know there's a certain part of me 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well emotionally I think uh women do a little bit uh 
 I I think that's the gap is coming closer a- as um what I've learned in uh just just being out there 
 It seems that men are now starting to get into groups called men's gatherings 
 and they get together 
 and they talk about issues of marriage talk about manhood talk about what they didn't have with their fathers
 Are expressing more emotions learning what emotions are 
 It may be in the future that men you know some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves 
 Um I I know of some mothers that I I guess I'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding more um low key more apt to be a better father than some mothers that I have seen that have been raised you know to develop whatever skills that they have 
 and some of the men are developing uh very good too 
 So it may come down to where it's it's individual basis Where everybody is treated an as individual and not by sex 
 If you want to stay home and take care of the kids honey that's fine 
 I will go out and make the uh take care of the uh money making 
 And it it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that
 On one income 
 <> uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that 
 Kind of like what uh my husband and myself are doing right now 
 My daughter's three even though at this current time she's ready to get involved with 
 she's an only child 
 I don't know if you've only got one
