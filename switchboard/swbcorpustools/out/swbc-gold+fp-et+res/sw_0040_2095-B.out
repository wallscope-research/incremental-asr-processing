 No 
 I've only been here a couple of years
 Uh but uh I've I've noticed that uh this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well I remember last year uh we had ice and snow uh uh 
 terrible ice storm uh around this time of the year
 And uh this year it's been so hot and uh sunny 
 it it's really quite uh quite amazing
 Uh-huh
 Um Yes 
 I was just talking to my son today 
 he's up in Boston
 and it was twenty-nine there 
 and it was you know in the seventies out here 
 and it was really uh 
 he really wished he could be here rather than there
 Oh really
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 I have you know 
 I I don- 
 I think it's really been delightful 
 I come uh I've spent most of my time in in warm weather areas 
 and uh uh the ice and snow just doesn't uh hold any allure for me at all
 Her- 
 do you you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas
 Uh-huh
 You must well uh 
 it must be quite a bit hotter down there isn't it
 Oh wow
 Oh yes
 Oh yeah 
 it's terrible 
 Orlando is the only place I've ever been where I've seen the car sweat
 that's really bad
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh wow uh
 I know I I tend to I tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate
 Uh it doesn't 
 some people say uh they they like to watch the changing of the seasons 
 but uh I'd rather you know like southern California you know have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time
 So it's kind of a luxury
 Yeah 
 well I guess this the weather isn't as lively a topic as uh as some of the others we might have gotten
 I guess we're supposed to say good-bye or something and think about what 
 my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye 
 We messed up the conversation anyway
 Yeah 
 I know 
 weather's just not all that inspiring 
 Okay 
 well it's nice talking to you
 Bye-bye
