 Well I'll tell you why I feel so 
 I feel strongly about this topic 
 I don't know a whole lot about the immigration laws 
 But I do know that in the where I live and I teach school there are so many Orientals that have come here 
 and there's a lot of Mexican people too Which is not neither here nor there 
 but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent uh very wise in money matters and have ta- have taken over a lot of businesses 
 and have 
 Really ki- 
 it's kind of scary because they're so bright 
 They're all the kids that I have that are Oriental are really far above the American kids 
 And they 
 and the the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up 
 And money is their main goal 
 And it's k- it really is kind of scary because there's there's just oodles of them 
 And you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals 
 And it's k- it's kind of scares me not that I don't want them here and not that I don't appreciate the fact that you know that they have rights too 
 But on the other hand you feel like almost they're they're invading us to the point where they're going to take over 
 I think probably that's a good idea Because I lived in Iowa for for about ten years before I came here 
 And I was born in Ohio
 so it it really 
 and there is there are a lot of Mexican people here because we're so close to the border
 And and they are wonderful people 
 and and I'm not you know I don't want to deny them their rights 
 Just that you you feel like when you were born and raised here and you worked re- very hard to make this country what it is uh it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over 
 And a lot of these people plan one day to go back you know to to Vietnam or to you know Taiwan or wherever they're from And take with them a lot of American dollars plus a lot of power in American com- com- companies 
 And it's kind of scary 
 And you know I don't know 
 I don't know the immigration laws that uh that 
 well and I do not 
 and in fact I don't know them at all 
 I don't know how many people they allow in the United States per year or if there's even a 
 I don't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore 
 Do you know anything about that 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 I would think so too 
 It 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Asylum of some sort
 Uh-huh
 Well Well I teach in the suburb of Dallas 
 and and uh my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas And with very very good school systems 
 And they're considered you know one of the top three in the state Both of them you know
 And it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools
 And they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here 
 And the kids in this area are very bright And come from you know parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and and uh very interested in their education 
 But uh I think in the last year I'm not if I'm not mistaken in four of the six high schools the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were uh alm- half or more Oriental
 And you know they're just extremely bright kids 
 And also they value learning
 Well I I think things come easy for them too 
 But I do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States 
 I don't they uh don't want to work for anything 
 They want it to come to them but and be there 
 but they don't want to work hard 
 And these kids work really hard
 And and they have 
 Yeah 
 I know 
 I agree with that
 But what I see is y- 
 the competition is there 
 but instead of meeting the challenge they're starting to resent them
 And it's causing you know I think some some problems
 It really is Because we see a lot of racial problems in Dal- the Dallas area anyway especially in Dallas 
 And it's mainly Black and and and Hispanic
 But uh there is some there has been some resentment with Orientals in the Black community because they've started businesses there 
 and the Blacks resent them coming in and taking their money 
 and there's been some violence because of it
 It is 
 It's it is very sad
 So you know I really 
 I I've I've always prided myself on not being prejudiced and being you know uh welcome welcoming everyone that wants to come here 
 And even when I was younger wh- when I was in college I was a member of the N A A C P because I lived up north 
 and I was very into that the human rights part of everything
 But I I've I've become very cynical in the last three four years living in Texas
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Well and exactly 
 that's exactly true 
 Plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time Two two three four maybe five years and then go back And pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them 
 And and uh plus a lot of American dollars 
 But in in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too
 You know you just don't know
 An- 
 and yet you know with uh with uh 
 <> there's somebody on my other line 
 but I'm going to ignore that 
 Uh anyway I just 
 you you kind of you don- you really don't know what to do 
 And and I don't 
 I want my kids to have values where they're accepting and so forth
 And both of my children are really tol- more tolerant of Blacks and H- Hispanics than they are of the Orientals for some reason 
 They feel you know like they've taken over 
 They feel like uh you know they're taking some of the the rewards that they should have
 And I really don't want that to happen
 But but it's happening
 And I think a lot of their friends feel the same way too
 So and I really do wish I knew about quotas and really wish I 
 <> <> I really do wish I I knew more about immigration laws because I have no idea any more Because they've changed a great deal
 Yeah 
 I don't really either 
 I wish I knew more
 Probably if I did I might be a little bit more uh tolerant perhaps 
 And I 
 and even if I I really wish I knew the situations they were going back to or coming from
 You don't know any of that 
 and you feel you know you can't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them
 Unless 
 and for some reason Orientals are very uh 
 my good friend calls them pushy 
 but I call them very that 
 they know what they want 
 and they go get it
 And in stores and so and so forth it's wh- 
 pardon me
 Yeah 
 But in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they can they get in front of you or they uh they take something that you had in mind to get before you did 
 You know just going for it they take it quickly
 And uh they don't think anything of that 
 And I don't you know 
 that's makes people resentful too 
 And so And yet they have they have a right to be here 
 and I know that
 But it's it sometimes it's gets touchy
 So and I'm sure it's a lot different 
 you're from Maryland You said 
 What part of Maryland are you from
 Oh okay 
 My sister used to live there in that area 
 And I I'm sure that it's a lot different there 
 Uh it's a lot different in I- than in Iowa than it is here 
 Is that right
 Uh-huh 
 Well I you know since I teach I see th- see it 
 And and I feel 
 and I love the example that most of these children give the our American children 
 And yet you know I can see why some of the parents are fear- that are fearful too 
 And and it's a kind of a touchy situation
 And I wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened 
 But it doesn't happen that way all the time
 So anyway
 It was good to talk to to you too 
 And have a good trip in California
 All right 
 Well thank you
 Bye-bye
