 That sounded like one
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 excuse me just a minute uh 
 I'm on the other line Karen <> 
 I'm sorry
 Okay 
 Uh she uh 
 yeah 
 well the the results 
 I I hear what you're you're saying about the results
 And uh it's what to do about it I guess is the the big thing
 I'm I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my my wife teaches school here in Plano
 And I know that uh the results that they get out of the system sometime is is certainly not you know up to what the effort they put into it you know 
 I've seen that for years 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the the home environment
 And uh it if uh no matter what they do in the the classroom if they go home at night and you know it's all totally undone uh 
 The the thing that uh uh that Karen my wife has has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what no matter how bad their teachers are no matter what a lousy system they're in or anything else
 these people somehow manage to uh you know push on through and are successful 
 It's uh unfortunately probably what maybe twenty-five or thirty percent of them do that
 Well ye- that would be be at the absolute most
 And uh you know those those that you know come out you know fall out of the system that are are real trouble 
 I I wonder whether that's just a uh uh a part of the system you know
 if you know in a democracy where you know people have kind of uh a freedom to sort of do what they want you know there there's an inefficiency there
 and you've got to let those you know those 
 Uh-huh
 Oh oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 And sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive you know
 you from the minute that you walk in until yo- until you leave your your competing against somebody else 
 or your competing against uh a system or or something you know 
 and then a lot of the- 
 there is a personality type I believe that is really noncompetitive 
 They're cooperative rather than competitive
 and when they get into a real competitive system they just say oh well what the heck and uh tend not to you know do too awful well 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I would think so 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 it uh 
 right 
 survival becomes more of a priority than than education
 and unfortunately you know there's uh there's and old joke about uh you know 
 education's wasted on the youth anyway
 You don't you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway
 I know when I went to school uh my attitude was kind of one of you know these people are you know taking a tremendous amount of my time you know 
 and I've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again
 I guess today that would be uh some how or other there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing 
 but 
 The uh the cure some of the cures that I've heard for this that that sort of make sense 
 uh most teachers after they have taught for a very long especially at the the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately
 And uh it's kind of these intervention programs 
 Now a lot of people will get to looking at these and say hey that's socialism 
 and that's communism
 and that's you know 
 and then it gets political
 But uh boy
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Um yeah
 Well you know the the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable 
 There are kids families that should just simply be taken out of the homes you know And uh uh you know uh just removed from those situations
 or they're never going to get anywhere 
 But yet politically that is not a very popular view
 I'm sure that if you you know ran on a platform of you know we're going to find the kids that are having trouble at home and we're going to take them out of the home 
 Yeah 
 you know how far you're going to get with that
 Uh but unfortunately it's it's something like that in lieu of that you know is the intervention programs in school where the these kids are are spotted fairly early on
 and uh you know there's well that's get to be a problem in Texas you know because different school systems have got more or less money to take care of that sort of thing
 you got counselors and all that 
 But you know you can counsel a kid eight hours a day 
 and then he goes home 
 and and uh you know in the in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or or something like that
 or they don't care 
 You know mamma wha- guess what I did in school today 
 well who cares you know
 True
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I'm 
 I don't know if you've ever had too much to do with uh oh especially Asian Japanese families coming 
 here in Plano we've got uh quite a few
 Uh engineering types people who have come from Japan
 and they put their kids in the U S schools 
 and they're appalled
 You know not so much at what the schools are teaching but what they let the kids get away with
 You know they they see most uh 
 they're they're quite upset about the uh the disruptive influence of school 
 Most of them would say you know those people should be removed from the school system
 And in Japan they would be you know
 But uh here again you get back into a political thing where uh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 were you at Baylor
 Yeah 
 did you go to Baylor
 Oh oh okay 
 I'm uh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 well that's that's it 
 you you don't have uh you don't have the view
 I graduated from Texas Tech more than two years ago I guarantee
 and you know I kind of look back at it sometimes 
 well that was a lot of fun 
 but we- you know I'm not sure that that I took the greatest advantage of you know what I went through there
 Uh-huh
