 Are you in the part of town where uh they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling
 Well maybe they don't 
 I I know that was supposed to be in May 
 and I couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were
 Yeah 
 th- That's going to be interesting because it's uh we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is uh 
 I look at our big green containers 
 and I say well they work fine 
 and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors 
 but it's clearly a place where uh uh 
 it will be interesting to see how well that works 
 and I am I'm glad the community is doing it 
 Uh it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people 
 Uh I don't know if where you grew up in your what you saw back uh years ago 
 but for me the thing that strikes me is I uh growing up in rural South Dakota where hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that uh in the fifties uh you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now Which was all the milk bottles were glass 
 and you got a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them 
 Pop bottles all had a deposit on them
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 So uh you know I look back at at uh my childhood 
 and I'd say you know they were doing things then that we should be doing now 
 and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're we're uh kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this uh throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well I'll have to say I'm I'm the only one I'm good at at this point is the newspaper Uh taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans uh getting rid of those 
 but on the plastic I have uh I don't have any habits there yet 
 and I'm guess I'm waiting for the city to to push me in that direction 
 but But it just seems like on the larger scale that you know the we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things 
 and I think if uh if we just start to put you know the nickel deposit on things like uh was the case years ago that uh it would have more immediate effect uh than 
 because I remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money
 and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window 
 and so outside my little town we would uh go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something
 Yeah
 I 
 well that's interesting because 
 they're back to glass you're saying
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 The carton The paper carton 
 Yeah 
 Well I mean the 
 you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing 
 and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood uh racks which now basically you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold uh twenty-four bottles 
 And and uh uh I'm not really say going back to good old days 
 but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now
 Well it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because like on the uh grass I'm I know your husband uh doesn't really like the paper sacks
 Yeah
 I'm the I'm the same way because otherwise uh 
 oh I'm I generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays and Neal uh Neal's a person who says I like to pick it up 
 but I don't believe in throwing it into the uh the landfill 
 so I have my compost pile 
 but most of us don't have the uh sufficient lot size to uh to do that
 Uh so I'm glad the city's willing to take that on
 Well there's someplace you know 
 if it's 
 because really when I look at what my grass does in in actually about twenty-four hours uh knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally uh composts or stores 
 and uh so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it 
 and it will naturally decompose uh 
 so you just have to kind of keep in separated 
 and then uh who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into 
 but it's certainly usable material
 Uh-huh
 Right <> 
 But I the thing I don't understand about that is like when 
 it's one thing to send grass there 
 but I've trimmed trees and other things which uh end up being something that clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly
