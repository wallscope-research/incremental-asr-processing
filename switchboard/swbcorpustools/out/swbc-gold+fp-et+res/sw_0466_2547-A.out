 Okay 
 What uh go ahead and tell me about your home 
 Oh is that right 
 Oh that's interesting
 Okay 
 Yeah
 No 
 that's okay 
 Okay
 Oh that's neat
 Wow that's large 
 Uh-huh
 Oh well that's not too bad
 that's still fairly new
 Well 
 Oh you're kidding 
 Well do you mind if I ask what it's worth down there 
 what it's 
 Okay
 It it sounds like 
 from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand 
 Dallas is a very marked up area 
 although right now it's a lot lower um because of all the layoffs and everything 
 the economy around here is real poor 
 Well no 
 not really 
 Um the area itself uh the Fort Worth Dallas area um has become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies including Texas Instruments 
 Um there's been tremendous amounts of of uh layoffs 
 so really housing is real bad 
 The economy itself around here is not too terribly bad 
 but housing is still real bad 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 This is 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Wow
 So do you think
 it was overdeveloped then
 Wow
 Um
 Um 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Well right now we're just renting 
 but it is a home Um
 it's a four bedroom home 
 It has about I guess eighteen hundred square feet 
 It's on one floor 
 Uh we have no basement 
 I don't know
 Okay 
 I wasn't sure 
 Most of the ones you know up north and everything do 
 but um anyway it's uh it's pretty also pretty typical for the area 
 Most of this area was developed 
 this house was built in seventy-four
 So most of the 
 it's almost twenty years old 
 and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style 
 Uh we have a friend that lives two blocks over 
 and his house is almost identical to us except his is three bedrooms and ours is four
 but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same 
 So I I think most of them are 
 there was 
 it 
 like most areas that are built um 
 there were probably like two or three styles you could choose from 
 And and uh that's pretty much all the houses in the area for probably a square mile I'd say at least maybe even a little bit more than that
 Where are you in relation to Sevren
 are you close to Sevren
 Okay
 Well I just 
 I have a sister that used to live in Sevren
 And they bought their home in I I want to say like around nineteen seventy-five or something like that 
 and they paid like 
 they they had it built from you know 
 they they designed it and everything 
 and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it 
 and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand 
 Yeah 
 so I just wondered you know if the whole area was like that or 
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Yeah
 Sounds like a lot of money though 
 sure
 Yeah
 Right
 Oh yeah
 Wow
 Yeah
 Wow 
 Wow that's 
 Really
 That much of a difference
 Wow
 Yeah 
 Wow 
 Why is that 
 Do you know 
 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh
 Oh 
 My goodness 
 Wow
