 Well I think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care 
 and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately uh the invisible hand that which Adam Smith wrote has uh provided some very good health care and uh much I think inadequate health care Uh 
 and in some cases the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces
 and I think uh it's inevitable 
 It is just a matter of uh time and mistakes 
 and they're both inevitable
 Well it's going to make it tough for them 
 and it's going to be a difficult transition 
 I don't know uh how it's going to uh play out in terms of the particulars
 but I don't think that society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long 
 Our uh physical and mental and spiritual health uh it's really uh very costly
 And uh as a society we are paying a staggering price for this
 My 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 there are abus- they're abusive of privileges 
 Right 
 Well this I think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten or twenty or thirty years will address 
 Because I know this is addressed by uh in Canada 
 I I have a good friend who is uh a physician practicing in Canada 
 And they made the transition uh 
 and I think that the uh 
 for example the duplication of magnetic resonance imageries uh 
 I've I've had one myself 
 and uh they're wonderful technology 
 but cities have three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need 
 So I think that what the market place doesn't do because of the way the system has worked 
 and it doesn't allocate resources oftenly because there is a tendency uh at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills
 but it's begun to change all of that 
 The people paying the bills uh 
 employers ultimately have begun to squawk because they have seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years
 So I think the evolution will be interesting 
 Uh Hawaii has a system that is apparently working 
 and uh it will be interesting to see how how uh much more attention we pay to that 
 I do think though that it is inevitable primarily because of the pain uh that people are feeling uh under the circumstances 
 Uh I believe that it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care whether it's subsidized by the government and and operated by private insurers uh 
 I don't know 
 I like that idea 
 I tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances with the profit incentive work very very well 
 Uh I we would be a lot better off if we if we contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste
 Well that's that's the problem with government uh administration of these programs 
 and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with 
 Government is going to have to change in this regard
 You know that is really a tough one for me to answer 
 I don't uh I would like to see the greatest improvement in management 
 My my my field is the cognitive sciences 
 and I recognize that a lot of these things that are done are done uh as a function of the operating systems in place 
 And those operating systems have to change 
 and and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems 
 and so a State or federal application uh could work 
 Uh it all depends upon the way you structure the environment 
 We may have to deal with
