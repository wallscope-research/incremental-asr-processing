 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 I see
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's for sure
 Well we uh 
 I just got married about six months ago 
 and we bought a house at the same time 
 So we're 
 I'm sitting here in my forty year old house 
 and we're about halfway through the painting process 
 So uh the only uh 
 I guess the the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color 
 We ended up with our our living and dining room are now uh kind of a a light peach color with uh 
 and it's got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff 
 so we've got the trim in kind of uh kind of an off-white 
 And this is really the first uh interior painting project that I've attacked 
 And it's it's been uh it's been something else to say the least 
 We we had the same type of situation 
 Uh the walls were uh uh 
 well they weren't 
 the color difference wasn't so bad 
 but uh there was semigloss underneath
 and we put a flat over the top 
 and everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see 
 It seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint
 Every time the sun would come up in the morning I'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can 
 But uh we've learned 
 We we uh we worked we've worked our way back into the hallway 
 and and we're in the middle of the bathroom now 
 But uh it's it's been quite an adventure 
 <> The other the other thing that makes it uh a little more difficult we've got all hardwood floors 
 and uh we we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the since the first time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a tooth toothbrush and what not cleaning up
 Well it's it's not too bad 
 It it uh 
 the floors are finished with a polyurethane
 and it's really not to bad to get off 
 *[[typo to> too]] it 
 it 
 we're just using latex 
 and it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even 
 It it it uh comes off with like a mild abrasive pad like a scotch-brite pad or something like that and wa- and soap and water 
 So we got pretty lucky on that
 No 
 not really
 But 
 Okay 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Oh gosh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 probably so
 Okay
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I uh 
 Yeah 
 we uh our house was painted as part of the purchase contract 
 so we didn't have to mess with that this time 
 But I've I I grew up on a farm 
 so I I've I've messed with outdoor painting a little bit uh 
 but most of that it was done with a sprayer and uh up in the bucket of a loader tractor or something like that 
 so it took a lot of the hassle out 
 And then they're 
 we're not you know you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a grainery or something like that as you would be with your own house
 Uh a little bit 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Oh gosh 
 yeah 
 Just just the opposite of what everybody's uh working towards now
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 absolutely 
 Yeah 
 we uh we stocked up the first time around 
 But we've definitely got all the formulas on file 
 and uh we're they'll be there for a while 
 We're we're pretty comfortable with that 
 But yeah it 
 it 
 I'm I'm real nervous every time I I open a new can 
 I'm wondering if I shouldn't buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a in a washtub or something somewhere because I'm alwa- I'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match
 But uh It's gone pretty well 
 It just 
 it it takes it takes some time 
 My problem is while I 
 I'm not overly proud of it 
 but I'm a self-proclaimed proclaimed perfectionist 
 and it it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that 
 And I'll find I'll find something as I'm going along something not related 
 like like uh I've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they they really didn't match 
 They were 
 a few of them were broken and things like that 
 So I always pick up these little extra tasks as I'm doing this
 and and the painting actually takes probably uh a fourth of the time 
 and I'm always doing all this other stuff 
 and my wife's hollering at me and wondering what else I've come home with from work this time to to put in a ceiling fan or something strange like that 
 So uh it it it always 
 it it it gets you to look at everything real hard when yo- you start putting a coat of paint on everything 
 you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it sure makes a difference
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's it's been uh 
 we we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend you know spend a lot of time working on it 
 and uh it was part you know 
 part of the excitement was was getting a good deal on an older house that just it really hadn't been taken care of very well 
 It it was actually 
 it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that 
 So we uh we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it 
 But uh there just isn't enough time 
 I I I fi- find myself going to work knowing that that there's a job about half done at home 
 and I really 
 if I would if I'd just stay home and finish it I'd feel a lot better 
 but uh I'm I'm starting to learn that there's always something else 
 Once you get done you can always start over 
 and and you make up all kinds of excuses 
 So uh *[[ slash error ]] Uh not a whole lot 
 *[[slash error]] It 
 they're they're in pretty good condition um as far as uh major repairs You know lo- a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that 
 but uh the only 
 the most major things have been uh oh I guess I I moved a couple of outlets and er uh switches I should say 
 For some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway 
 and uh 
 yeah 
 and I I didn't like that very well 
 so I I moved that 
 but uh most of it most of it's in pretty good shape/
 Uh live in Dallas
 Okay 
 okay
 Uh
 No 
 no 
 I haven't 
 uh I hadn't tried
 In fact we were we were planting flowers this weekend 
 So uh I was pretty tied up 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that uh 
 Yeah 
 you know it 
 I get a so- I get a sore neck from looking up all the time yeah things like that 
 but uh no 
 that pretty much covers my experiences
 Oh yeah 
 most definitely 
 It it just 
 it makes such a difference 
 I 
 like I say th- the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much 
 Uh I you know I I don't want to put a price on it 
 but I just feel like we're every every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house 
 You know ev- every time I do something aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home an you know o- the walls are clean 
 and they match and all those kinds of things
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 we do 
 It uh it sometimes works 
 and it sometimes doesn't 
 It's a uh 
 when I start doing trim I I've gotten to where I I tend to freehand it because ther- there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that uh it it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore 
 and uh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 they y- 
 No 
 there's no carpet in the house right now
 Umkay 
 Well you know um 
 Yeah 
 I I've p- I've seen uh 
 they're they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths 
 And you can uh you can tape them together 
 and and and put
