 I was going to say my uh college is Northern State University in Aberdeen South Dakota 
 and our head football coach Dennis Muir <> used to be an assistant coach at B Y U
 So I thought that was kind of an in- interesting coincidence
 Uh Northern State University in Aberdeen South Dakota
 I ju- 
 in what major or what year
 International business
 Yeah 
 And you
 Okay
 Well that sounds interesting 
 How long of a program is that
 You know I read a study once 
 and it said that uh like thirty-four percent of uh college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program
 It took me it took me five years
 {D So } you just you get started 
 and you change your mind 
 or you want to pick up a second major 
 if you're management you you thought I I'll take that marketing 
 it's just only was three more classes you know 
 and you just doesn't happen that you get out in four years
 But 
 My advice is is uh look for at the student to faculty ratio you know 
 if you're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one I don't think you're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one
 Yeah
 it was about twenty-six to one
 Yeah
 Which is you know 
 it it's interesting 
 but it it's 
 what I thought was nice is you could al- there was always time to talk to professor you know 
 and and they knew you
 You weren't just in their class you know 
 and so you could you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time 
 and or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever you know you could sit down talk to them about a problem 
 They're always willing to help you out 
 So but I I's I I put that against uh my high school where we had uh a biology class of three hundred and fifty students 
 and 
 Yeah
 it was a biology lecture class
 and you know it it just wasn't the same 
 You're sitting there 
 and you're taking notes 
 and you know you got a computerized test scores multiple choice because there's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test uh you know a three hundred fifty person short answer test 
 And it just wasn't the same 
 You you'd run you'd pass the teacher in high school 
 and even in high school you could say high to your teachers unless you're in that biology class 
 and they just they'd look at you like do I know you 
 or should I know you
 Do you get uh a lot of tutoring 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 And you could get there 
 and his office hours could he could have like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty-two people waiting to talk to him 
 and you still didn't get to talk to him anyway
 Well what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college
 That's excellent advice
 Well it it it does get it 
 You know you get to the point where it's I'm never going to get done
 You know I was taking summer classes 
 and let me get out of here
 But uh no 
 that's good advice 
 Even if you don't have your major decided on have an idea what you think you might want you know 
 so you don't want management 
 but you think you want business
