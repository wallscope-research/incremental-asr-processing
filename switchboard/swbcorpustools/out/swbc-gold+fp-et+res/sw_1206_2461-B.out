 Okay
 Fantastic 
 Well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is uh about the uh funding of the the school system right now
 Evidently uh that's that's a big problem
 Right
 Oh Lord yeah 
 an you talk about stress and pressure 
 I tell you what 
 it's uh 
 Do 
 right
 Exactly 
 and 
 That's right 
 and then they uh poof it off you know do like Tarpley
 But uh I 
 what gets me is I can't believe that Congress uh our state legislature can't come up with uh some kind of workable means to have funds for the school 
 You know it's uh 
 I just don't understand that
 No uh 
 sure don't 
 my wife and I've just been married about two years 
 but I have a sister that's a uh school teacher 
 and uh 
 Okay
 Okay 
 so it's getting close
 Right
 Right
 Exactly
 Right 
 that's true
 Exactly
 Right 
 right 
 Well and uh you know one thing my wife and I've talked about i- are uh private schools You know whether uh uh we would want to invest in in private schools as they're g- growing up because you know just in the Dallas area um we're not real comfortable with the with the public schools
 Right
 Right 
 You know one that's one reason we bought a house here in Plano 
 We were hoping you know well the school districts going to be good you know for resale value and so on and so forth 
 but uh I can definitely uh see on down the road you know where we do have kids and are getting to that age that's going to be a definite concern
 That's 
 yeah 
 and you know that's 
 taxes right now are political suicide You know 
 and I don't think any politician's going to do that 
 so 
 Right
 Exactly 
 And you know it's going to really hurt the the middle class uh people I think Because uh they're the ones that will probably have to to carry the brunt of the load
 So uh 
 Yeah 
 now that's that's just unbelievable to me you know
 Well yeah 
 we didn't we didn't even think about it you know 
 R- right 
 Exactly 
 right
 Another reason yo- 
 and you want to encourage them you know to to be active and everything in school 
 but uh you know with all the peer pressure that's going on with all the negative things it is uh it's a tough environment to be growing up in
 Okay
 Right
 That's right 
 that's right
 That yeah that is a scary thought 
 but uh I don't know 
 I I guess what you have to do is just uh keep in uh you know encouraging them and and uh uh try to be open with them so that y- you can deal with the problems as they come up
 Yeah 
 and 
 Right
 Exactly
 That's right
 Right
 That's true 
 that's true 
 and uh 
 Right
 Well and I think uh you touched on it you know 
 you've got to start them at the home You know 
 that's where they that's where they get the the deep rooted values 
 and and and uh and that's about right 
 Then you just have to hope and pray that that everything uh works out works out okay 
 so 
 Okay 
 well hey I appreciate the call
 You to
