 Well uh it seems to me that uh that 
 I do not know whether the jury system uh 
 I I should not say I do not know 
 I do not feel very uh stronger that the jury system should be changed 
 It seems to have worked uh time immemorial 
 And when uh difficult decisions uh are made uh uh uh they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on
 Uh I know in some cases now in some states depending on the criminal code uh a unanimous verdict is not required 
 And indeed some juries are no longer twelve people 
 they are down to as little as small as six people [ [ in I think in petty ] + [ in in uh in uh in ] minor ] felonies and uh and misdemeanor trials
 Uh I think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing simply because uh there is always uh there is there is always a jury that might be swayed uh by the moment uh to either to be too lenient or too vengeful I guess
 Yeah
 But is not that uh is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world 
 If if if they keep giving everybody hundred year sentences and the people in various states it does not seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons Or even in for that matter uh repair the uh the lack of judges and and and other uh 
 Yeah
 yeah 
 you know that might be it 
 they they certainly 
 I do not I don't know how it is in Virginia 
 but in Florida now uh uh uh at eighteen years someone was just sentenced to eighteen years I heard it on TODAY uh without any specific recommendation for uh uh uh uh uh uh waving the normal uh procedures 
 And the eighteen years will uh translate into something like uh four point seven if every if the if the prisoner is a model prisoner
 and indeed the present overcrowding conditions uh prevail
 Plus I guess there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial
 So uh yeah 
 you might be right about that 
 I I I do not know 
 it just seems to me that only about uh from what I read only about ninety percent of the ca- only about ten percent of the pa- cases come for trial anyway
 And uh only about uh f- four or five percent of uh 
 in the in the very end 
 less than less than half the trials that go to uh less than half the cases that go to trial uh end up w- with uh with the jury actually making the verdict
 That most of it is plea bargained uh half way through 
 or or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway
 But uh uh how do you feel about the uh about the jury system itself 
 Do you do you think that should be changed 
 Or do you do you know in Virginia whether it is if they have smaller juries 
 or 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well I guess we 
 Yeah 
 I guess we always focus on criminal trials with th- with the jury 
 But I know you have a right to ask for a jury in in any sort of a case that even where damages are are are uh are the result of some sort of a uh an action that you are bringing against someone else You can ask for that to be heard before a jury 
 Takes a heck of a long time I guess to get there in some states 
 I I I do not know uh 
 I should imagine Virginia from what I read uh uh is like every other state 
 It it is faced with uh uh enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system 
 Because I guess everywhere I read that there is a shortage of judges
 Not that they won't appoint them 
 but there is no budget for them I guess 
 Or and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the clerk uh court clerks 
 So it seems uh 
 no 
 I I I do not think I would change it 
 The more I verbalize it I I do not think I would want to change the system
 I do not know what we would replace it with 
 Yes
 Uh and yet there are there are so many there are so many people in prison 
 the prison population uh as far as I I uh you know 
 my impression of it is that it has that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty
 I mean it 
 so has our I guess our population has grown some too 
 But there there definitely is uh uh you know to me the one of the worst things that could ever happen uh from what I read and see and understand 
 I do no think I could handle prison
 it would be very difficult
 Well there must be a ca- a a a very great degree of that
 But but there again I I do not know if the the jury system itself uh comes in to play there 
 I would think that 
 one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability 
 of course th- it is a constitutional right that the press must have here is th- the interviewing of jurors after the trial 
 that it seems to me that that that when a jury makes a decision they should not be asked uh before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision 
 I do not 
 I imagine there is a certain certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that 
 But I I would think I if I did anything I would protect the juror from from any sort of an inquisition after 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 Well I do a lot of business up in Washington 
 I was there during the during the trial actually 
 yeah
 Yeah
 yeah 
 yeah
 Oh I felt that way
 I felt I felt 
 no 
 but 
 Yeah 
 I always balanced in the in the situation 
 I remember the jurors uh 
 I thought to myself how did how did 
 they only I think they only uh found him guilty on one count Which was uh not even which was a class something felony Which was not even punishable uh uh to the degree that they thought it 
 But I do not know 
 maybe when you are there in the r- in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got to make a judgment on somebody 
 And the prosecutors do a lousy job 
 or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it 
 I I am not making excuses for 
 That might be it
 I think I am getting a call coming in
 All right nice talking with you
 Thank you
