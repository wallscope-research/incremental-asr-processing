 Uh-huh
 Well I think that's wonderful
 My children are in college
 But I teach school 
 and I teach uh middle school age children
 And so I see a lot of uh variation in what happens when kids are at home
 Uh I have taught school ever since my children were little
 But the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's 
 and your holidays are too
 So teaching I think is a a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well with them being as young 
 It was much much harder when mine were young
 And uh I really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his uh college work and his Master's degree and so forth 
 and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a job
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 it certainly is 
 We 
 Well I think that uh we need to spend more family time together with with children today 
 Uh we made a point to spend a lot of quality time 
 and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were involved in you know like uh through scouting or you know anything like that 
 we participated 
 And uh we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now
 When 
 yeah 
 when uh the kids were in high school it was harder to always have supper together 
 but we did always have breakfast together
 So we we had supper together as much as possible 
 but when it wasn't feasible you know we kind of kept a master calendar and when it wasn't feasible well that was understandable 
 but uh we've always tried to spend time to talk and uh have some time together time 
 and we sat around the table 
 we didn't sit in front of a T V or that kind of thing 
 So I think that's been important because we do have a close family
 and even though the kids are basically uh grown uh they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and uh have spoken before of they want that kind of you know situation for them when you know and their children when they marry and have children
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 They model 
 and with the dysfunctional families today I'm sure with a as a schoolteacher also you see what happens to these kids when these families never communicate or they're dysfunctional as far as the between uh oh second families uh one parent families or all those kinds of problems that they have 
 and then you see them magnified in the children
 Oh boy 
 yes
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 It is
 It is 
 And m- I think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children
 and I think we make a point to do that
 Because we see we see all the time the outcome of not doing that
 and I think if we weren't so interested i- in children in child care then we wouldn't be teaching anyway
 So 
 Uh I wish we could reach more of the rest of the world 
 I think uh the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools 
 it's what's happening in the families
 And uh they expect us to you know have create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers
 and you get to a point where it's completely impossible
 And you just get more and more frustrated 
 and yet you feel for the the kids 
 You do the best you can 
 but
