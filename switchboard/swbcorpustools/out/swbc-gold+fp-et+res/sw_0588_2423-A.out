 So do you have any hobbies
 Yeah uh
 I'm an avid gardener oh
 Um I consider that a hobby 
 I don't know 
 they were like suggesting like handcraft things which 
 I guess that's a really true true hobby 
 but I I think anything that you enjoy 
 um it doesn't really have to matter 
 it could be working on cars could be your hobby really
 *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] well I don't know 
 I told my husband I said you go out some to work on the car 
 it's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong 
 I says you go pay to have someone do it
 Because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something
 Oh yeah 
 Um well right now we um start our seeds inside
 We'll start them inside 
 and uh 
 Yeah 
 well we usually start them right in the house
 My sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck 
 and and the wi- and a wind storm come and knock it down
 But she's had really good luck 
 i- ca- 
 next month 
 well actually it if you if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside pretty much the end of May 
 you can leave them outside
 You might put them in the ground just the first week of June
 but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of May
 Oh
 Yeah 
 well well we live we live really close to Lake Champlain which is in the Champlain Valley
 so we're a little we're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts 
 so 
 Yeah
 We are a little lucky 
 Well my brother lives ten miles from here 
 and he gets frost 
 and his crop gets killed
 Yeah 
 from Plattsburgh Air Force Base
 But um 
 Yeah 
 Plattsburgh's kind of a 
 it's uh it's uh depressed economically
 When you go across the lake um 
 I don't know why we have so much going for us 
 I really don't
 I'm just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at Digital 
 and they've never had well they've had layoffs recently 
 but when we got hired here no no never any layoffs never never
 and now we're looking at serious 
 I I'm a technician
 When they start getting rid of technicians 
 Well I interviewed with them
 But I didn't want to go to Texas
 Even though my um mother's people are from Georgia
 Yeah
 Well I guess we have to get back to hobbies since 
 Stick on the subject
 Well interesting thing that I do is with gardening uh 
 my sister grows flowers that you can dry
 and you can make fl- uh dried flower arrangements 
 and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun 
 And we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with uh dried red flowers and dried white flowers and uh eucalyptus
 Yo- you know what eucalyptus is 
 It's 
 Yeah 
 it's got a s- 
 Yeah 
 at first I'm like oh how why do people like this 
 but it it is kind of a nice smell after a while 
 People put them in 
 *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] it's it's it's uh like a fad thing 
 I I don't know 
 It's I've never heard of it 
 in the last five years I've used so much of it that
 I hate 
 Yeah 
 it is
 Yeah 
 it it looks really po- potent stuff
 But uh it's yeah I think it's the greatest stuff in the world though 
 It's jeez 
 they I make all kinds of things with it 
 We make all kinds of things just with dried flowers 
 I I almost want to start a business doing it 
 but I don't I I'm so uh timid when it comes to starting a business
 Yeah 
 it is especially with the being in on the creative a- aspect and the crafty end 
 You know after a while you make some stuff 
 then you start looking at it 
 go boy this this is kind of ugly 
 But I know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby 
 Um he does it believe it or not I wouldn't imagine why but to get out of the house away from his wife 
 because he's a seasonal worker 
 he works in the construction 
 And up here it's almost a pattern 
 and you see your fathers do it 
 then their sons do it 
 What they do is they work construction
 then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter 
 And uh this guy was going nuts 
 and his uh son built him a garage and got him some uh oh I don't know what the equipment's called but planers and things and s- set him up 
 and h- he makes all kinds of furniture for um his kids 
 and he makes uh uh like little kids' furniture 
 He gets right into it 
 and uh 
 Yeah 
 it's a it's a really good thing because it's keeping him sane
 and plus it's keeping his marriage 
 so and and plus he's getting on in his years now 
 He's he's not that old 
 but he's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost to to do something like that 
 And uh it's really it's it's uh hard work 
 I couldn't imagine taking lumber raw lumber and trying to make something out of it 
 He d- He dowels everything
 And it's all got to line up 
 It's 
 and uh I don't think he goofs too much 
 I don't to see too much scrap around
 God I'm envious 
 Is it going to be Is it going to be really dry 
 Uh are you pl- are you 
 now I always plant trees in the fall 
 I don't know why 
 so the the cold weather can kill them
 but I guess 
 Oh that's good 
 I guess they they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall all 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and uh when you have time to do it 
 My sister does uh flower gardens 
 She gets right into it
 She spends lots of money on them 
 And I guess a lot of people do do do that 
 They landscape their whole house with flower gardens
 She's got like just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch ba- tree bark all over her lawn 
 It gets ya- 
 Do you have a lot of shade trees around your house 
 or is it 
 So you don't have a lot of tree coverage
 Because goi- going to make 
 Yeah 
 See um uh where my uh well my grandmother passed away but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees
 and they just shade everything
 Uh it's in Georgia
 It's yeah it's right outside of Macon 
 and and it's just a 
 I like the way that I like the way that idea of the south is 
 but when I think of Texas I think of nothing but no trees and just grass 
 Yeah
 So it's that dry heat
 Well where is it 
 is it Hous- wasn't it Houston's humid
 Yeah
 It's humid
