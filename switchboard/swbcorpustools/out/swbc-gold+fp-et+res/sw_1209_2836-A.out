 Okay 
 Uh far as you know crime in the cities I'm sure like in yours it's pretty pretty bad 
 Uh probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies 
 and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have 
 How about you
 Uh-huh 
 Prob- probably right if you look at it from that stand point
 What uh 
 is there anything uh that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing
 Uh-huh 
 Do you live in a real small town or or out in the country
 How far out from the city do you 
 About fifteen miles 
 I live in a little suburb uh which is I guess from Dallas is twelve miles or so
 but it's pretty congested 
 We are considered in the country
 but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country
 Our major crimes in our immediate town uh is probably robberies house robberies and very few instances of you know alcohol drugs uh reported 
 However I'm sure they're there
 But uh right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their their uh existence in that neighborhood
 And since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms uh and including the out uh the outer perimeter type uh devices sensors and things like that 
 It's cut back you know considerably 
 but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood 
 so it still uh remains city wide pretty pretty high
 Uh I would say the majority of it's happening during the day uh between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon
 Most 
 Well most families most families are young 
 and both people are working
 So they're happening during the hours they're gone from work
 Uh so uh I would say that's probably their prime motivation 
 They'll they'll stock your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there
 Uh they classify most of them as professionals
 Uh you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking uh you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick
 Probably the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles 
 the you know Mercedes Volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets 
 guns that sort of stuff
 Very few you know penny penny ante stuff
 Well uh the police force for one 
 I think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use 
 Uh it's 
 oh right now I think we are about thirty thousand people 
 and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people which is not very many
 And 
 Well the 
 course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever 
 so they're giving the early release uh
 Yeah 
 and and it's 
 I think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences uh 
 but for the 
 That would be certainly be a deterrent
 And uh not necessarily you know give in to their uh human rights desires 
 You know if they're overcrowded just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate Uh
 Uh I think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty you know in a lot of cases 
 Course I I know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof
 Uh
 I'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody 
 and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes uh to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through with that
 Uh especially you know in the case of murder
 uh I know in my case I my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty-five
 and we caught the individuals got caught 
 we uh we went through the court system and all that sort of thing 
 and uh you know two counts of kidnapping uh you know the the forty-five to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine yards uh you know the guy only got five years
 And you know he was out within two months because of the parole system 
 So what what 
 Do what now
 N- no 
 I'm not real familiar with that
 Oh
 Well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after him 
 and they said well you know he they're he has no job 
 he has nothing 
 there's nothing that he has that that you could go after
 Yeah 
 Uh very seld- 
 Yeah 
 They don't do that here 
 Course they pay them 
 but they don't you don't 
 you or the insurance companies never see any of that money
 And uh you know and they're right now they're reluctant to go after him because they're you know they're they're repeat offenders 
 they uh been in jail before 
 they've been released you know several times which is another uh deal I hate to see
 But uh you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes and and uh and car theft on top of it destroys my car
 and we're out you know uh you know fifteen thousand dollars 
 and you know the guy gets out in two months 
 and he goes out and commits it again 
 Fact he's back in jail now 
 So what what uh 
 Yeah 
 What what deterrent does he really have
 Yeah 
 I think in our in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real real possibility
 Uh we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually you know shot the people
 and uh return offenders have 
 they've actually waited for them where they've robbed you know particular neighborhood 
 they'll rob one house 
 then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else try to take it in their own hands
 Course it doesn't always work out in their favor
 But uh nevertheless I think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of us 
 you can you know you can get some of us 
 you can't get all of us
 Uh and we're beginning to see more and more of that
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's that's certainly a possibility in in 
 we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death
 And uh it helps for a while
 but then just another different set of people come in 
 and most of the people are transients from out outside of the state
 Uh I would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught they're from places like up in Oklahoma and Louisiana Arkansas you know across the the border
 So you know people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
 it's not many from the local communities
 But uh it's a problem 
 and I I just I think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in stiffer in their penalties
 would be a definite deterrent 
 and and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people
 Right
 Uh-huh
 I know like in my wife's case they made her feel like the criminal
 They they went to all all
