 Afternoon Doug 
 it certainly is uh going to be a pleasure to chat with you
 And I'm uh certainly was surprised to uh to hear from you 
 Normally I talk to people in Plano Texas
 How did you get on this list
 Well okay
 All right 
 Well now what would you say about these everyday invasions of our privacy 
 What ideas do you have on that Doug
 In what manner
 Uh-huh
 Well the thing that I thought they were uh concerned about was was people calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something
 and in reality in many cases they knew or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations 
 And I thought was uh beginning to invade the privacy of people because the things about where you live and and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business 
 and they in return come back and try to sell you something with this additional knowledge 
 To me that's an invasion of privacy
 Uh-huh
 You mean your history in regards to uh the charge card company or something like that
 Do you consider these serious uh problems
 Uh-huh 
 Well what should we do about it 
 or what could be done about it do you think to correct it
 Well I would think that uh information held on records uh by any company or charge card dealer or person should be absolutely private and and not be allowed to be uh to given out by those companies
 it should be made a a uh national or a state law to protect people so that uh you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies
 In other words if you call the company yourself directly uh and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else uh you know from the outside so to speak then you would you would feel more free to uh to go into detail with them
 but but we have no control of that now
 and then uh you you're when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you you feel that it someday might be used against you
