 Yes 
 just this last summer we went back to Utah 
 and we met it was my 
 we usually go to my family reunion 
 but this one was my husband's
 and they're usually quite similar I think
 No 
 he's from here
 but uh most of his people are from Oregon 
 so we kind of met halfway
 and so this was one 
 and they um planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and had you know 
 things like that have to be planned 
 like they had planned 
 that we went to the reunion in end of Jul- June and first of July that part the fourth of July weekend 
 but we had to plan everything like clear in December January to reserve that
 Uh-huh
 No
 this was everybody
 Oh I oh I jeez I think over um three hundred were there 
 It was quite a large 
 it was a great big lodge 
 and so we had plenty of room and everything 
 and some of them live in that area 
 so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave
 But um that was a great big thing 
 and we do that with his family about every five years a great big one 
 And then like immediate family we do like we try to do one thing once a year
 Well he has eight brothers and sisters
 so that's big by itself
 Yeah
 So we have a little shindig with them
 Um they're close in a close proximity 
 Um let's see 
 there are four of them who live here in Texas and his mom and dad
 So um the others live in close neighboring um states like Nevada Arizona I think like that 
 yeah
 so it's been fun 
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's hard
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 It really is fun 
 and my mom's family does it once a year just like you said
 once a year um they have a a a Wednesday through a a Saturday type thing 
 You can come and go as you please type thing
 And they do that once a year 
 I kind of missed it this year and felt bad 
 but you can't go every year 
 you just cannot do that
 Um
 Um basically they just stay with each other brothers or sisters 
 There are enough in the area to to just kind of span yourself out
 Whoever's mom and dad it is you usually go and stay with them 
 like I go stay with my mother 
 and my cousins they just go stay with their mom and dad you know kind of thing 
 And so it's not hard in in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area
 so that's not hard 
 but the real planning that's the real key
 and they send out 
 my mom's family now 
 this is the first reunion with my husband's family I've really been involved with 
 but my mom's family each brother and sister takes a turn one year 
 and that's how they divide it up
 and then Um she has ten in that family
 and each one of them take their turn
 And then the the parent who's turn it is the child whose turn it is her children help her 
 like if it was my mother's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing
 Yeah 
 and um the thing is that um the the real part is there are two mailings that go out 
 and the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making
