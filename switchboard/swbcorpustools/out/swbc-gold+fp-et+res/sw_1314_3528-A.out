 Night
 I understand we're supposed to talk about spaceflight 
 I hope you know more about it than I do 
 Oh is that right 
 I haven't read his book 
 I was so upset with TEXAS that I haven't gotten into any more of his books because I thought it was just horrible
 Well 
 and I don't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in TEXAS 
 so I wasn't sure how credible he was
 But anyway what do you think we've gained from the spaceflights
 Ego trip 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh is that right 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Where do you live 
 You live in U- 
 am I talking to Utah right now 
 Oh oh great 
 Because I'm in Dallas 
 I see 
 I see 
 Carolyn Rash
 Is her name Rash Carolyn Rash 
 I see 
 I see 
 Well you probably know a lot about it 
 I wasn't sure that they were blaming that sp- space disaster on one company
 I hadn't heard that 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 I would think so too 
 You never think about that do you 
 I would think it would be harder to get up than it would be getting back down 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Well I saw one of some of those early space capsules at Smithsonian 
 I'm sure you've seen more of them than I have 
 but you could see the scorch on them you know 
 they had though piles
 but you could see where they would come off in the how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting
 Well I 
 go ahead 
 Oh yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Well these were the ones that John Glenn went up in you know and the old old ones 
 The very first ones 
 the little bell type things 
 Yeah 
 they really were 
 they just uh 
 Oh yeah 
 and uh the whole thing was small 
 and yeah you you actually put it on you know
 You put it around you pretty much 
 it was so small 
 Well I thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space 
 but did he go into that in the book
 I guess that's just to sell us on it 
 Oh yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Well that's true 
 and 
 That's right 
 Well do you think we should continue to support it at the level 
 well I thought probably one of the things they were doing that they didn't tell us was spying 
 Because I think those satellites you know or not satellites but the spaceflights could really spy 
 and with uh with Russia's demise I didn't know if we should continue to support it at the current level
 Yeah 
 Uh
 No 
 I don't 
 I don't either
 Yeah
