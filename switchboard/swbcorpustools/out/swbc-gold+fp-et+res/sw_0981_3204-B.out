 What is it about nursing homes
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh it's very difficult 
 I know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 how old is she
 Uh my see my father is ninety-two 
 and still uh he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing 
 but you know if something would uh whenever something happens to one of them then I don't know what I'll do up there
 I I just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes 
 and so 
 They're in Missouri 
 and I could I I know I know stories for sure that [ they just they they just well they ] can't take the proper care of them Most of them
 And uh it's it's tragic that you know when people live so long that they uh don't have a pla- really don't have a place to go
 So 
 Right
 Yeah 
 there's one very close to where my parents are 
 but uh I think it would be nice 
 but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything
 So uh he's from that old depression era 
 and uh you know it's oh it's just blissfull that they're both able to do everything for themselves 
 I would imagine that I'll uh if something happens I'll move one of them or bot- you know in in with me
 So uh 
 But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is 
 and but I think you'd have to really 
 they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the uh on this homes 
 But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a 
 I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot
 And so many people when they put people in the nurses home they never see them
 They never go to see them
 I've talked to many uh owners of places and say that nobody even 
 maybe maybe Christmas
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh I do too
 Or if i- if they could be real real nearby where they could see them everyday or so
 Uh because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing ho- homes uh regulation in Texas 
 so maybe we'll get it improved
 So 
 Anyway 
 Right
 Oh it's tough I'm sure
 Oh
 Right 
 that would be devastating I'm sure 
 so 
 It is a tough decision 
 and it's one that needs a great deal of thought and prior probably
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 I would hope we could do that and then go from there
 Well anyway 
 We've covered a little bit 
 and uh it's good to hear from you 
 and 
 Have a good 
 Have a good lif-
