 Okay <> Um
 In Plano
 Yes 
 Where do you live
 Oh okay 
 Huh <>
 Um I was trying to think uh 
 something we were watching the other day 
 and they were doing an overview of Los Angeles uh from an area that was up higher 
 and you literally could see the band of smog 
 That uh 
 I've never been out there 
 but it was it was quite evident that it was a real brown area 
 and 
 Yeah
 Yes 
 Yeah <>
 Yes 
 Well I know uh that's been the concern in Europe 
 They hadn't 
 uh we have friends in Germany and uh have family that live near the Black Forest area 
 and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we s- uh switched to the unleaded gas and and had the emission control advice uh devices required on the cars uh 
 that's something that Europe didn't do right away 
 and now they're doing that 
 and I guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country that's the only pollution that's been there 
 It's not an area that is industry 
 but they were losing a lot of uh trees and a lot of

 Yes 
 and 
 Yes
 Yeah
 Yes
 Yes

 I I get that sometimes um 
 my line gets some static 
 I don't know why 
 Well I know it's um 
 we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston 
 and uh oddly enough I thought our part of the country was ideal
 Oh I don't know what to 
 usually it's the other phone I have trouble with 
 It must just be on the line 
 Can you hear me
 Okay
 I don't know what uh I I don't know what the problem is 
 but uh when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater 
 and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy 
 and we have enough clouds that uh there are other areas that would be better suited 
 That surprised me because I think we have a tremendous amount of um sunny days
 And and it 
 yes 
 it can be used 
 and it can help 
 but uh that was a problem that they were still working on 
 But 
 Well I 
 Yes
 Yes
 Uh I hope so 
 Well I do think um 
 you've already mentioned several things I think uh just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in uh

 Yes 
 Well and and for the future generations too Uh
 Yes
