 Okay 
 well you 
 Um we got two cats
 Yeah 
 and uh um 
 yeah 
 we had cat you know my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my Mom developed an allergies
 so I'm used I'm used to having cats around 
 I like them
 Oh see I'm not uh I'm not a dog person at all 
 Yeah 
 probably 
 I was allergic to dogs when I was a kid in fact 
 I may still be 
 um we 
 That um 
 I wonder sometimes 
 Um but we um we house sat for a um my um my wife's boss a couple weeks ago 
 and um uh he has a dog and everything 
 we were you know we were sitting the dog and everything 
 and uh I felt like just miserable all weekend 
 and it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday 
 it was like hey maybe you're still allergic to the dog 
 It was like oh that could be it
 Yeah
 Well dogs are real high maintenances 
 you got to take them for walks 
 and you've got to pay a lot you know 
 you need to pay attention to cats and everything 
 but it's not quite the same thing
 Um and um um you know it's it's just nice that cats you know cats yeah you don't have to let them outside you know 
 all cats are indoor cats
 so you know they're not yo- w- you're not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood 
 and you know they you know they they make their mess in the cat pan which is 
 yeah 
 it's you know it's a pain to clean 
 but you know we used to 
 they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans 
 They didn't 
 Well when I was you know when I was growing up I had a clean the cat pan all the time 
 and I hated it because I had to carry everything upstairs and you know and use this thing to you know scoop the take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything 
 it was really terrible 
 But now they have like this you get these liners that is garbage bags you know 
 and you and you you know the 
 Yeah 
 the cats do it in there 
 you pull it and take it out and throw it away 
 and that's it 
 Uh-huh
 Same idea 
 Everyday
 Oh okay 
 I see
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So you don't have anything right now
 Oh except the kid 
 huh that's 
 Uh I don't I don't know because the cats pretty much um 
 yeah 
 we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out
 and um uh it's not a big deal really 
 they're they're happier when we're around 
 but you know they they're pretty much okay by themselves 
 um and I don't you know we couldn't do that with a dog
 Well that's That's um pampering the the petals 
 Uh-huh
 But they're not that much fun you know 
 you can't take them for a walk 
 you can't you know 
 they they don't they can't fetch you know
 they ca- they can't do anything 
 so I've never 
 I think we had fish sh- when I was a kid 
 but I don't 
 Oh

 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 No 
 it's like 
 I just I don't know 
 I I just never understood why what the attraction 
 they're you know they're pretty and everything 
 but I've just never [ s- + seen [ the attraction of having fish 
 It's not as much fun
 an eel
 Oh now we really get sick 
 Yeah
 Like I remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha and uh you know used to drop mice in 
 this is not these aren't cats you know

 Yep
 Yeah 
 well 
 Yeah 
 well a cat will do the same trick 
 I had a friend in col- I had a friend in college who had a um had a pet rat for a while
 Um I forget how she got it 
 but it was um it was the same kind of a deal 
 I think she got it 
 I think she was a psych major 
 and she got it from the psych department
 Whoops 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 you know if you get them young and everything before they go kind of nuts 
 so 
 Yeah 
 rats are not my favorite animals in the world 
 but I could see getting one from birth and everything
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I I I have friends with hamsters and gerbils 
 and they they tell me the same thing
 I just 
 again it gets into vivant much fun you know what I guess they can be 
 I
