 Well I've been real um thinking I'd love to buy a new car right now if I could afford it 
 But we have two cars right now 
 and we're still paying on them 
 but I would love to have one of these new mini vans 
 I've got two little ones 
 and I think that would be just the perfect family car 
 Oh 
 What is it
 Oh
 Yeah 
 We have um we have 
 we went out to buy an American car 
 so we bought um a Chevy Nova about three years ago 
 And and we opened up the the hood 
 and it said Toyota made in Japan right across the front of all the engine parts 
 Uh-huh 
 Toyota uh 
 well the Chevy Nova is the same car as the Toyota Camry 
 Uh at that time was the same car 
 so they just put different names on them depending on who they're being shipped to
 I thought that was pretty n- 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 That's why we were so surprised to see Toyota written imprinted on the engine 
 It was real interesting
 But uh I 
 with so many options now available you know where where cars are concerned it just seems like there is there's almost too much of a choice anymore 
 You know there's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever 
 I think that if I were really serious about looking for another car I would take into consideration the price naturally 
 But um you know I would really want something that I would want for that much money For ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars or whatever
 Oh yea- 
 definitely 
 I cannot imagine that you know somebody 
 I heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollar car about oh it would how exciting it is to make that kind of a purchase 
 and I thought I don't think I'd find that exciting 
 I'd be wondering you know here I am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money 
 That's true
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well we had a pretty 
 we bought our Chevrolet brand new 
 and then we bought a used car 
 <> Just a minute 
 I'll change your diaper
 Then we bought our our next car used 
 and uh we had better luck with our used car 
 and I like it more 
 It cost us less money 
 and we got more features and air-conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for twice as much money
 If you can find one that's r- uh you know reliable 
 If you can get someone that you trust to buy one from 
 or you know make sure that you can have it checked out well enough 
 Uh I wouldn't 
 <> Uh-huh 
 Sh 
 Yeah
 That's 
 we bought one like that
 Uh-huh 
 We bought one car that way 
 and had 
 we bought it real reasonably 
 and it was in real nice condition so because apparently whatever the bank get
