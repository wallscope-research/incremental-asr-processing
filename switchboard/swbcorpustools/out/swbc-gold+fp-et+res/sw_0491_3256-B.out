 Yes 
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I agree with you although I will say 
 I'm not sure you know 
 I sometimes have a problem with some of the especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have you know was was because they were abused a- abused as children 
 And the parents are saying Hey wait a minute 
 we didn't do anything like that you know 
 and and and I guess before I'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it it has to be a an absolute certainty you know like uh caught at it or something
 you know or if they they uh you know severely beat up on a child or you know I would have absolutely no problem at all you know with with 
 I don't buy the routine oh they're just sick 
 or they were abused when they were little
 well you know forget that
 Uh-huh
 Well but I can't see that either 
 I don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent ag- uh you know reason to not use capital punishment
 I think uh I think if I wanted to badly enough I could convince somebody uh I was crazy 
 so my family may say that on occasion 
 who knows 
 you know uh I I don't think it's that hard to do you know to to convince somebody that uh Gee you just had no control over what you were doing
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's the new one
 Well you you're right uh 
 and yet did you ever in your life when you were little know anybody or hear anything of anything like this
 No
 Ye- 
 well yes 
 I but I was from conservative Wisconsin 
 and uh you know there was there was nothing on it 
 which makes me wonder you know if it's as uh prevalent as as some of them claim
 It uh it it it's 
 you just don't know 
 and it all 
 unless they're caught in the act or the- the- the child is very badly you know beaten up it comes down to a one word against the other that type thing 
 Now Texas is capital punishment for 
 it used to be just capital murder 
 and now the- they added mass murder 
 Are those the only two things that we uh 
 uh you know because I have a feeling it is 
 and I I think there ought to be more things added to it
 Uh
 Yeah 
 I I think that's I you know uh 
 killing a child or kidnapping uh 
 and possibly not well 
 I guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt you know 
 if they release them two hours later he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty
