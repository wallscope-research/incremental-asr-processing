 Let's see 
 mine's pretty easy actually 
 Uh I just got done reading a a magazine a couple magazine articles about the uh new Saturns
 Uh and although I can't afford it right now I would just like love to have one
 Well 
 No 
 regardless of that fact 
 It's the best car in the class for the be- cheapest amount of money 
 I'm interested in having it for uh doing a little autocross racing uh closed circuit racing
 and uh it seems to just blow the com- compe- competition away
 Handling power everything 
 Yeah 
 it just got like the top rating 
 It was compared up against uh 
 let's see 
 there was like the Mazda M X three uh Nissan's whatever their two N X two thousand the Civic S I 
 and it just you know it it dominated over all of them 
 Everybody all the uh raters loved it 
 I like the I like the styling 
 and I seen a few of them actually race 
 and they seem to be really good cars for it
 Mustang G Ts 
 Uh can't afford it
 Right 
 yeah 
 I'm a graduate student 
 and let's face it 
 I don't make any money 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we'll see then 
 Yeah 
 right now I'm stuck 
 I I've got a a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that 
 it's fast but unreliable 
 and trying to get it prepared for racing 
 But it's it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the g- Saturn 
 Oh yeah 
 I'd do it I'd use it for both 
 The nice thing about autocrossing is you can you can do both
 Uh just like a uh set up a lot of times 
 and it's like really large uh parking lots And pylons and things
 Tight turns hard acceleration 
 I've seen a lot of Mustangs uh compete 
 and it's interesting 
 They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class
 Yeah
 Uh what are you thinking about buying
 The Legend
 Uh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well I was I was actually in uh 
 a lot of the B M Ws are produced in uh sh- uh Stutgardt and uh and Munich
 and I was I was there this uh summer 
 and uh i- I was really impressed by the uh the uh factory uh tours and such for B M W
 Yeah
 Uh
 Oh of course 
 of course they are 
 They want you to buy their car 
 Yeah 
 there 
 it was it was interesting 
 I was at I I also went to uh the Porsche 
 and uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed
 Yeah 
 the uh the B M W is really oh like oh we have all these like high tech things 
 and everything is put together with exacting tolerances 
 and and then you go to Porsche 
 and it's like well uh these cars are completely handmade
 and no two of them are alike 
 And 
 so it's like completely opposed 
 I don't know 
 which do I like better 
 I think I like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical
 Unless it's it's a toy
 Let's face it
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 but it it B M Ws good for that 
 What kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it use it for
 Wow yeah
 That's cool
 Yeah 
 that's good 
 I also I was impressed by uh by the Mercedes too
 I really I really like the Mercedes
 The factory was nice 
 and 
 And is it different for the for the B M W
 Probably
 Right 
 I can imagine that
