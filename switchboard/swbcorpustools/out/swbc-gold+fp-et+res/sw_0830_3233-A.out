 Okay 
 well uh some of the books I've read lately have to do with crafty type things where I've where I've um learned things that I'm going to do for my children for Christmas
 and they were really uh helpful because I didn't know how to do this one stitching 
 and so that was very helpful to me as far as books 
 Otherwise um I like to read children's books and things like that 
 What about you
 Oh
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 It's interesting that you said that 
 My husband and I had uh took a book out of the library about gardening too and started a garden a fall garden
 Um
 Oh Yeah 
 and our our uh cantaloupes and and um peppers and tomatoes are on right now 
 so it's been really fun 
 and and we learned that you know um some of the gardening skills we had were before 
 but some of them we learned from a book
 and so that was helpful to us 
 Now I've read two books uh that were uh nonfiction lately
 and uh I 
 well one was nonfiction and one was fiction 
 and the fiction one uh was about a boy in uh during the time of Adolf Hitler
 and he grew up and lived through a concentration camp
 and that was not enjoyment 
 That that was too realistic and really um mind a real eye opener uh 
 and I guess it's good to read those things too Uh 
 but I didn't enjoy it necessarily
 and uh the other one was quite enjoyable 
 It was uh about a a Chinese lady and her generations down her what happened to her family through the years
 so that one was good 
 I think all of 
 well even if they're not enjoyable they bring you a uh some kind of of learning 
 so even if it's the country that they're from or anything like that 
 So I I I like to read the the children's books 
 I think that's the most animated and imaginative 
 So I like those a lot
 Oh there are a couple of Newberry Award winners 
 Uh A WRINKLE IN TIME is one
 I don't know if you've ever read that
 but but um oh there's one about an Indian girl 
 and I can't think of that 
 ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS is another
 and that's a good one 
 Now some of the ones that have just received the awards this year I haven't read 
 and I would like to read those
 but uh it's funny because I've read some from like nineteen twenty-three and nineteen forty-five and things like that
 and I didn't enjoy those as much 
 and I don't know if it's just because they didn't come from my era or what 
 but uh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 No 
 even that's good
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 uh my children and I uh I started a thing where I read a book with them before they went to bed at night 
 And there was one called THE PIG PRINCESS 
 and it was a a princess from a long long time ago 
 and she came through a a spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig um sty 
 and the people that she came to were just farm people
 and she didn't understand them 
 and they didn't understand her 
 but it came together in this book 
 and it was really a lot of fun
