 Have you ever been drug tested
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I had I've had uh <> two or three drug tests that I had to get before I could start working at a job uh different jobs 
 I had one at T I and then one at another engineering company 
 And really I don't mind them
 I don't do drugs anyway 
 I guess if I did maybe I would 
 but um I don't know 
 I know a girl that she's a nurse 
 and they get drug tested randomly 
 I've never been randomly drug tested 
 But that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going to be drug tested and you didn't know about it
 Yeah 
 I guess so 
 <> I guess so <> 
 Do you think that it's right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Right
 That's true
 Right 
 That's true
 I believe it's right especially for certain jobs 
 I think anyone in a in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and things like that 
 I think they should be randomly drug tested 
 I believe full force in that 
 I don't know that I believe every secretary in every company needs to be
 You know secretaries aren't aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something 
 So I don't know 
 I I'm kind of biased too because I don't do drugs 
 and so I really don't care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me Because I have nothing to worry about 
 So I guess that's kind of biased
 Yeah 
 It does
 Yeah 
 That's true
 Yeah
 That's true
 But what do you do about the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before 
 and you know it's it's been the whole weekend since they've done anything 
 and they happen to be tested Monday morning 
 and they could be fired for that <>
 You know that that's kind of unfair also
 Yeah 
 I guess so 
 I guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences 
 That's true 
 That's true
 That's true
 Yeah 
 I think so more than drugs 
 And I know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab
 They would pay for an alcohol
 but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation
 Yeah
 That's true
 I think that's fair
 Yeah <> 
 That's true <> 
 That's about all I have to say on it 
 Uh it's a urine test
 And they uh 
 it was really very official 
 You have to go in a room solely by yourself sign papers that say you were totally alone sign papers that say this is yours
 and and you have to seal the bottle yourself and label it yourself and all of that 
 So that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's I guess or something
 Yeah 
 I know
 I ca- it's hard to believe
 but I guess it does 
 I know 
 I'm amazed at the things people will do
 It is amazing 
 I guess there are people that do that 
 And they are those are expensive tests
 I'm glad I never had to pay for one
 Yeah 
 I guess so 
 Oh really
 How weird 
 I didn't know that
 Oh that's weird
 Yeah
 That's wild
 It's amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 That's true 
 I'm glad I never had to do it by giving blood 
 I can't stand the thought of giving blood
 I can't even do it for Wadley even though it's a good cause 
 <> Well I enjoyed talking to you
 Thank you
 Bye-bye
