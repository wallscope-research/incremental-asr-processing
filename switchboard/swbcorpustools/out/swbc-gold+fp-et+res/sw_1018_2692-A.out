 Are you a T Ier
 Oh good
 Yeah 
 uh she had a hard time getting a few folks uh 
 I thought well every all these T Iers have gone home uh at one o'clock on Friday
 I I I do it a lot 
 I have 
 I kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid
 Uh so and my father and brother were in it 
 and and my brother's still in it 
 And I had periods when I didn't do anything 
 but in the last ten years I've uh my car doesn't go to a shop you know 
 it it 
 I just do it all 
 Do 
 I uh 
 there's hardly anything that other than putting tires on that I'll do 
 I did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but I change the oil and transmission 
 and uh uh I do essentially do it all 
 I don't know uh uh if there's anything specific 
 In fact I could advise people uh 
 I happen to be a M E besides 
 But I do it for fun really and to save money
 And I guess that's diversion 
 Uh I I've I've tried a few groups uh you know where you 
 I can recommend it for people to take their cars 
 Like I think Sears is probably the best place
 because I've heard when I used to go there and when I 
 I just overheard what they did for me very little because I didn't take it that much 
 But what I heard them tell other people was always right
 You know when I sat there I you know I dropped my car off for tires or something like that
 And so I respect 
 they seem to actually have mechanics there
 I was pretty impressed with Western Auto 
 but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission uh oil last time 
 And when when I did it the next time I realized the filter was loose and everything 
 and I didn't like it 
 So I'm just doing it all myself 
 I I 
 You had to do it 
 Yeah 
 right
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 Well you like Fords apparently huh
 Yeah 
 Really
 My goodness
 Yeah 
 I won- always wonder when you have little things like that happen why even here at T I why we don't inspect {A I'm in facilities } why we don't inspect areas and and guarantee it so to speak Uh
 we always fix things and rep- put things in and walk away 
 We 
 there needs to be a time of inspection and check out 
 And and s- thing like that with a car 
 there ought to be someone there that inspects it before it's turned 
 There ought to be an insp- inspector or quality insurance guy after after an oil change you know
 Just in case uh they didn't put the oil in or whatever 
 I I always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh
 Yeah
 No 
 no
 I don't either 
 I don't either 
 yeah
 Yeah
 You need to really uh 
 I I do uh a lot of the simple things 
 I I think I do most of the things better than the average person
 You you have Fords and I I uh I have three Chevys which 
 I worked my way into having the same engine 
 I don't know how long I'm 
 I like a V-eight 
 And I'm I'm s- sold on small block Chevy V-eights 
 And I I bought one car new 
 and I almost accidentally got the next car although I was kind of looking for it when I got a u- a used car with the same engine
 Well then the nex- the truck I got next I definitely looked for the same engine 
 So I buy filters you know three or four at a time
 And essentially the engines are different 
 y- 
 the cars are different years but the same Chevy V-eight
 And the par- the carburetors is the same 
 Almost everything is the same 
 Th- the course is two are eighties and one eighty-six you know
 So you can learn a lot that way 
 I 
 there's no way I could I could fix every car in the world you know
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I think they're all bad really 
 They're 
 Uh-huh
 Is that right
 Yeah
 What did they want to charge you for it
 Yeah
 Yeah
 This is your little water uh heater in there for the uh the heat inside
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Did you get it inside or outside 
 I I took one off my little Buick I had 
 and I pretty much took it loose on the inside 
 But it came out from the you know underneath the hood
 It came from 
 Yeah
 Maybe you're right 
 maybe you're right 
 I 
 it's been a long time since I took one out
 Course I broke mine you know 
 so I'm always very careful when I change hoses on it
 I don't know whether you did yours 
 Not to really pull on those 
 I when I take those hoses I cut them off very gingerly
 Because if you sp- you know pull on that 
 and I've always done that as a kid you know just yanked on it
 And they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time
 But I broke one on my on my Buick 
 And I always remembered it was my own fault 
 and I thought well I'm going to t- going to carefully take those hoses off
 Oh really 
 Yeah
 It it spread out 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Sometimes if you're a tinkerer you luck out 
 My wife's uh Chevy uh it was a Caprice air conditioning stopped 
 I I just heard it 
 I realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in
 And I went out there for five minutes 
 and I just pushed on the wires 
 And sure enough just pure dumb luck that the connection over by 
 it's not the evaporator the big filter on one side
 I just pushed that in and I heard it click
 And so sometimes you have dumb luck 
 I I was you know 
 you could have taken something like that and thought well the compressor's not working Or it would have taken me all day probably if I didn't do that But sometimes you have some dumb luck If you have a little curiosity and you have enough knowledge to check things out 
 I know I feel bad for people who just when anything goes wrong a fuse you know they just have to take it 
 And I know that's tough if you don't uh at least give it a shot 
 I've got girls daughters and I've always said I'd teach them 
 And my my one daughter was fairly interested 
 And I really haven't gotten around to 
 I learned because I I just uh learned you know 
 and I feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things 
 And I'm going to do that 
 I I told my daughters in college this year I said This summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car 
 I said So you can learn the basics you know
 Yeah
 Right 
 I have the 
 there's one expression I don't like <> uh the country expression you know if it ain't if it ain't broke don't fix it
