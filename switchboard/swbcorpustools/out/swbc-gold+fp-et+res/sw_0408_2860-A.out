 <> Yes 
 Tell me what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up
 <> *[[what is this]] Uh-huh
 I have two boys also 
 Uh my children are um are swimmers 
 and so as they were growing up much of uh our um normal life outside of school and everything arou- uh revolved around their swimming
 So in order to have a reason for being there especially as they got older I became involved in it too 
 so we were always together at their meets
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 the the boys tried those 
 but they w- they did go in 
 they started swimming when they were oh seven and eight 
 and they really loved it 
 and they're swimming both c- 
 they'll be 
 one is in college also swims in college 
 and the other will continue to swim in college 
 and they're fortunate 
 they ma- even made nationals
 And so we would drive up to see that when w- whenever it was reasonably close 
 but we did a lot of things um 
 and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children um
 we live near Washington 
 so we we would always go in for the museums
 That's always a big uh thing 
 And one of my children is uh also a musician 
 so um one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go either my husband or I or both of us would t- concerts with him
 And my other child um uh is in big into tropical fish
 so our whole family we take family trips to different places to visit fish stores or go to fish shows 
 so 
 I don't think we've we've missed a fish store on the entire east northeast coast of the United States 
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 In fact it's funny 
 our vacations have always been um uh uh as as they've gotten older 
 When they were younger we would go to the beach 
 but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things and that there would be a a feature each day Whether it would be going to 
 one summer we uh we went up to New England 
 and we went to the marble quarries up there and uh to see that and another day fish hatchery 
 and so we did you know we did try 
 and of course we learned too
 But uh and uh I don't know 
 I uh 
 when they were very young I did not work
 Uh-huh
 And I I started working part-time when they were in um junior high school and high school 
 and now and I worked in the school system 
 and now I work a full school day 
 but that leaves me off on holidays and summers
 So it was a it was a you know 
 I think they need me more when they were older than they did when they were 
 That's true 
 yeah
 That's right
 Um yeah 
 that's that's for sure 
 That's for sure 
 what do you do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 when they you know 
 it was funny 
 I can remember 
 and my mother and I have talked about it to how important it was when I came home from school
 It wasn't really conversation 
 but there were always things that just tumbled out
 And uh uh granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it 
 but it 
 when they when it's not there they miss it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 No 
 I I I realize that 
 but it's funny 
 they don't always do it 
 but occasionally they do 
 and you want 
 and when they do there's a reason for it that they're sharing it
 and you want to be avail- I've wanted to be available when they for some reason they had they were bouncing something off of me Because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned about 
 and it was uh 
 you just felt gee if I weren't here how 
 or or if my husband 
 That's right
 Yes 
 that's exactly right 
 Uh but it has been um it's been interesting and particularly I I think because the society in which we live families are separated 
 You don't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles
 Um I grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 See and we're 
 uh that 
 we I I grew up with you know 
 every weekend there was some visiting somewhere
 Um and it was sort of an Italian family
 um but my children 
 we although we have some relatives in the area that we we see we 
 they don't ha- 
 it's not that constant thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 And I I just sort of think yeah 
 that 
 the trend of of families and time 
 where where parents are spending less time you don't have the families too to take up the gap
 And so the kids in some ways are are are suffering a little bit in that uh the model the role models that get the the the family issues that get discussed and all these I think are very important parts of them growing up
 so we we try to to do it as well as we can 
 We keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone
 and cousins and aunts and uncles 
 and we do 
 but it's although it's not the same we are 
 and that's part of I think teaching too is what a family is like 
 because then h- how do they pattern their own
 Yeah Um
 That's 
 yeah 
 Well we've always we have had this tradition um that we always go out before Christmas and cut our own tree
 And that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had 
 Now this year it's was hard with our son now being in college
 So this was one thing that we um weren't able to do this year 
 but we did that for e- from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until uh our older son went away to college
 And we have advent calendars still from the time that they came you know to 
 Oh
 Oh yes
 That's 
 uh-huh
 Well o- ours is uh 
 a friend uh a friend of mine from Denmark hand appliqu3ed one for each child
 And they look today as new as they did when they gave them to she gave them to us 
 and there's a ring 
 and you buy a present
 and you wrap the present up 
 and the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of Band-Aids and an eraser and things
 to today where um sometimes I put a little gift if I see something that's uh occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save for their their future to sometimes just money uh pieces of candy 
 So I think as they're getting in college I just 
 for my older boy that was in college I put a dollar bill for each day Which was the equivalent 
 well it was the equivalent of a Christmas present
 But it was uh and it was and you know it was fun 
 but that's a tradition 
 and they will those will be passed on to them when they when they get married and leave
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 yes
 The b- 
 yes 
 and the broken families 
 We um as I said living in an area of Washington D C We definitely see this uh 
 and uh it's that grandmother figure not only raising her own children but raising um children from the streets too frequently
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 well this is a this is a si- 
 uh this is in fact uh 
 we've been studying this in our school that um this is one of the symptoms or not the symptoms 
 it's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing 
 it's a rite of passage
