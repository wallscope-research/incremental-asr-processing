 Do you have any
 I have I have one
 and it's a real pet peeve of mine
 It seems I I do work during the day 
 and when I'm home uh you know I'm either cooking or running doing things or uh laundry or stuff 
 And I hate when the phone rings and it turns out to be a telephone salesman
 And it's real 
 the two pet peeves that 
 number one I really feel that that's my private you know my own home 
 And I ha- 
 and if I want something I will get it
 I will go out and get it myself 
 And I will never I never buy anything from a telephone salesperson
 So I really feel that it is a real invasion they're invading my time and my space by you know interfering in whatever I'm doing 
 fr- 
 and I 
 it really bothers me
 Um it's a little bit like junk mail but except you can't you know ignore it uh quite as easily
 And I I try to be polite
 but at the same point 
 Well I just say thank you very much for calling but I'm not interested 
 and then I hang up before they can say anything
 Yes 
 and it works very well 
 Because you don't hear you know how 
 they can say anything they want 
 it's just 
 but I just feel that's my big thing on the invasion of my thing on invasion of privacy
 And um I have uh I sort of have a sort like 
 you can prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists 
 I wish that there were a way that you could um get your tele- you know submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty for anyone who calls you to sell things from a busi- 
 Uh you you you you do that by uh um 
 the postal service has some information which you fill out and they send 
 it's for every company 
 you can't do it for any compan-
 you know but you can then send it 
 and they can pro- 
 they tell 
 that company is not allowed to sent it you any junk mail
 If you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out to not to get you know junk mail from specific companies
 And I wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company
 and you could say that uh have your na- your number put in a registry 
 And then anyone making these calls have to check that registry for that area and could not should and is not allowed under penalty of you know being reported or something to call you
 So that would be one way of doing it
 Uh-huh
 Oh I'm guilty of that sometimes 
 because I've called and there really wasn't any significant message 
 and I and I wasn't going to be available to be called back
 And it was sort of like oh the hell 
 I'm not going to spend the time giving leaving a message 
 and uh I'll call later if I'm available 
 The other thing that um that there is recourse to and that's another thing is when you you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number
 Well leg- legally now they're not allowed 
 they're n- 
 you do not have to give a telephone number
 Yes 
 And I don't really like announcing in public 
 you know when you're sitting there 
 my telephone and I don't like the wa- way telephone numbers can be used
 We once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number 
 but it turned out it had to have been my husband's office phone number 
 And uh we were able we weren't actually able to trace it but we were able to to discard the charges
 Um but it was 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 same with my husband 
 It was the charge card and social security number
 Well you should never give the social security number 
 Uh if sometimes if you charge 
 sometimes I charge theater tickets over the phone 
 And then you know because they pick them up at the box office we'll call 
 But um that's the only thing I would ever have ever used it for the phone 
 and that was because I initiated it
 Uh and occasionally I do order things from catalogs over the phone 
 But again it's I initiate it not the company 
 The other thing is though you do not have to 
 if you're buying something in a store and they as- and you pay for it by charge and they ask you for your telephone number you do not have to give it 
 That is one that's a law that went into effect I don't know a year or two ago
 And uh you can just say I'm sorry that yo- uh I'm not required to give that by law 
 and then they won't 
 a lot of stores will still ask
 But uh the credit card company you know accepts the charges 
 it- 
 a rea- 
 the credit cards company's responsibility 
 So wha- in this 
 Um well this would this is limited to the privacy issue the invasion of privacy
 Yeah 
 and I guess uh that was my that's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy For people outside the family of course 
 I've got little pet peeves you know with my family
 You know But of course th- 
 I guess that just comes with the uh with the territory with a family that 
 does a mother can do some privacy 
 But uh 
 Uh-huh
 Nothing that you felt that you know 
 any experiences you've had at work
 So many things I think over the years have been um accepted when you uh that are no longer done
 I can remember when I was very young much younger and I applied for a job 
 they said well d- aren't you planning to have children 
 Well that's none of their business
 And but of course now by law they can't ask that
 So there has been I think a lot to done to protect privacy
 How do you feel 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 That's right 
 Do you feel that drug testing is an invasion of privacy Or AIDS testing
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 I feel that way too 
 I sometimes feel th- you know sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit
 You know for example airline pilots 
 I do want my pilot to be sober 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 That's right 
 Yeah 
 I know i- 
 yeah 
 I feel you know I think some of the people that oppose you know mandatory drug testing for certain areas say well it's not
