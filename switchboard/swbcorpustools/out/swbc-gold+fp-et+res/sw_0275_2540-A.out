 Well Stephanie what's your position on gun control
 Uh-huh
 Now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles
 Really
 And that didn't help at all
 Huh
 Uh-huh 
 I usually just 
 I'm trying to think of 
 I guess I would tend myself to be more towards the the like three where I don't think you should necessarily ban guns any by any means 
 but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature uh 
 you know you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one and you know right off the shelf 
 And but 
 Uh-huh 
 exactly
 And so I think that kind of control is would be good
 but the uh 
 I you know I'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement and just to kind of exam it a little bit 
 and I I know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true uh 
 only the guns were in the hands of the criminals 
 but how many times 
 I guess I have never heard of a a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun
 And maybe they just don't report those 
 or I'm not sure 
 or you know I can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed 
 but good thing they had their gun on them 
 and they they thwarted the robbery attempt
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 True
 Did did you were you brought up in a family that hunted 
 or 
 How about that
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh jeez
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I've also always thought about the idea you know most sports you know which are the N R A and people have their thing you know 
 if you ban guns you're just banning the the recreation the sport of hunting things of that nature 
 Most of that's done with rifles and such Uh though there's you know probably I'm sure some sector that does it with handguns 
 But just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous 
 you couldn't be inconspicuous when you walked into a store stuff like that 
 you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately you know 
 you- if they had to have a rifle or was 
 you know made it more difficult to get a a uh a handgun 
 Now of course you know in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want
 But I guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and you know temporarily a little bit uh offset or off keel 
 I don't know if that's a large percentage of uh crime or not 
 but I guess it would be some 
 But I I think definitely 
 like today they just introduced the what's called the Brady bill The seven day mandatory waiting period on getting any guns 
 And I think that Shoot that's a good idea
 Oh sure
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 that's crazy 
 Yeah 
 that's kind of kind of wild
 Uh-huh
 That is kind of wild 
 Well that's all very interesting 
 Well thanks for talking
 Good-bye
