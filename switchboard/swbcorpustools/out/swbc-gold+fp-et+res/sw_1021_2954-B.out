 Have you ever uh organized a family reunion
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 How many people usually show up
 Oh it is not that big
 Because uh we have had sort of weekends like that too 
 But I never thought of it really as a reunion
 I sort of think of a reunion with my uh all the extended family 
 Yeah 
 That would be hard for us because most of the family is out in California 
 And some is in New York and North Carolina 
 and it gets 
 it is kind of hard to get ev- get everybody organized 
 Uh is there someone 
 do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there 
 Or 
 And there is there is uh 
 he keeps a s- uh food out there year round 
 So so he does not live there though
 Vacation home
 Yeah 
 It sounds nice Uh
 are there kids that are there too or mostly adults
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Are you all located in Texas
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 That to me is 
 yeah 
 Dallas I know of 
 Houston I know of 
 and that is about it In Texas 
 The rest of it is sort of a big void to me
 But uh you know we have uh well 
 we all got together 
 it was about two years ago for 
 I was 
 I had graduated from college 
 And uh I was going to live in France for a year 
 And so my parents invited 
 it was not just family 
 it was friends too 
 But uh we all got together for just a party 
 And that was kind of fun
 Nice to have everybody together at once and things like that
 Well not quite French 
 but uh it was sort of a reunion before leaving 
 It was fun 
 It was on uh New Year's Day 
 So it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time
 Yeah 
 It was kind of fun 
 But uh but who was it 
 A friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago 
 and you know everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend 
 And it really sounded like it was fun 
 But I am not quite sure what I would do 
 I think it would be fun to like rent a big mansion or house someplace and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know And have different areas to explore and things like that
 So that would be kind of fun
 Yep
 Where nobody lives 
 But at least that way it is at nobody's house so nobody one no one person is responsible for everything
 Yep
 That is for sure 
 The cleaning up can be a mess
 But uh do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm
 Does does your dad have horses there
 Uh-huh
 I see 
 so it's 
 so he really does use it as a vacation home 
 It is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that
 Uh-huh
 Well that sounds nice 
 Do people actually pick the fruit and things
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I used to we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend's property 
 but we never got enough 
 I used to make jam 
 but I never had enough to really make you know more than a jar or something
 So it was not so worth it
 Uh-huh
 That sounds 
 is 
 does he have a lot of land to go walking around and things there
 Well that is pretty big 
 I do not know how they do scale down there 
 You know here it would be a huge amount of land
 Yeah 
 Because they 
 per- is 
 this house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres As opposed to tens of acres
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think my dad put some 
 We have a little pond at our at his vacation home too 
 And y- 
 really little
 And they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in 
 and there were too many little goldfish 
 and so the big ones never got bigger
 And uh somebody suggested to get a bass
 And so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again 
 No
 So we do not know whether it is living 
 or 
 Yep
 We still have lots of little goldfish 
 They propagate pretty well those little fish
 Yeah
 because we started 
 we have got hundreds in there now 
 and we started with I think ten or twenty little feeder fish that I picked up for a dollar you know ma- no matter how many it was for a dollar 
 And and some of them are probably eight inches long 
 But he wants your really big ones you know the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long
 And 
 It 
 Oh okay
 Well we would want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys the goldfish too 
 But yeah 
 We could see 
 I do not know if yellow catfish live up this way 
 But catfish do I think
 Uh-huh
 So that 
 you mean 
 well we could try it 
 That is a good idea
 Because he was trying to catch them you know using little uhhh 
 I forget 
 there's little uh nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that Minnow nets or something
 My father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish 
 And it was really funny 
 because uh one time he left the net in the pond 
 and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish
 And uh he left it in the middle of the pond 
 And that night he came out and the trap was gone
 And it was a raccoon that had taken it
 So it was really funny 
 And you could see that you know 
 you could see where the trap the trap was dragged and things like that
 And so 
 But do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there
 Uh When they are feeding
 Uh-huh
 What do you feed them
 Really
 And it is especially made for catfish
 Uh-huh
 That is funny
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I have never seen catfish you know except in fi- filleted on a plate I think maybe 
 I think I have seen once or twice in like the museum
 But I have never seen them just alive someplace 
 That would be fun to see
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 How big do they get
 Okay But how long in feet
 Do you know
 That is pretty big though
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 That sounds amazing 
 I will have to see them sometime 
 But all righty
 Nice talking to you too
 Enjoy your uh weekend
 Okay 
 You too 
 Bye-bye
