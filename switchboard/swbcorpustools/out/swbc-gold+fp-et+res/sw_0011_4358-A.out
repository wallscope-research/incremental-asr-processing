 Okay 
 What is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling
 Uh-huh 
 Well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts 
 Some some local communities are very active in that uh in that respect 
 and they do have bins set up 
 But I live in a a metropolitan area 
 and uh they're not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that 
 Uh-huh
 I I know a lot I think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort 
 Whether 
 and and I think that and I know Massachusetts has 
 a bottle bill was passed 
 and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now 
 and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the uh the store and not uh 
 that's the majority of people that I know of anyways 
 Where people aren't really you know eco conscious It's just the fact that it's something they have to do 
 And I'm not going to throw a bottle away 
 it's like throwing a nickel away 
 That type of thing
 But uh people need to be more conscious of it
 Yeah 
 It didn't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans 
 Uh and and matter of fact I think it took like three tries t- for it to go through 
 But and it's been pretty successful 
 and people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know 
 people would dr- have a drink of soda 
 instead of throwing out the window they they keep the bottle 
 so it's it's been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth 
 But more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing 
 And that's the big thing I think that th- they try to promote
 Yeah 
 that's a good idea 
 Yeah
 Th- there definitely has to be a motivation factor 
 and I know that at w- where I work 
 I work for a defense contractor 
 And there's a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh Styrofoam usage because of the uh the process involved in Styrofoam and and the whole eco issue and that 
 And and they're very proactive 
 and uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh china wear rather than uh Styrofoam stuff 
 so So i- i- it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it 
 I think that's that's what they need to do Be more proactive like that
 Yeah 
 They they just 
 matter of fact that that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa- 
 the local schools you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school 
 and what they'll do is they'll recycle it 
 Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh trash uh the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time 
 A guy went to a d- a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty 
 because they don't they don't degrade over such a period of time
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Okay
