 Okay
 Oh I guess the stuff that was done more in the seventies because [ that's + *[[slash error]] Well no that's ] really when I grew up 
 so that's really what I like better 
 is that kind of music 
 
 No 
 no 
 no 
 not that kind of music 
 No 
 more like uh rock um you know like Led Zepplin type 
 Right
 Right
 Oh sure 
 sure 
 I went to their concert last year when they were here
 Sure 
 yeah 
 I like them
 Okay 
 well I just didn't know that much about music 
 and I wasn't sure what kind of music
 What what kind of heavy metal are we talking about 
 What 
 Okay 
 like give me some examples
 Oh well Bad Cam- Company's not bad 
 that's not
 Yeah 
 A C D C 
 Yes 
 Well okay
 Okay 
 I guess I didn't really consider that heavy metal
 I I think when you say heavy metal I'm I'm thinking about like Cinderella you know
 Well see I don't really care for Cinderella 
 But I like A C D C's okay
 Yeah 
 No 
 I don't really care for that too much I guess
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Is that the kind of music that you like
 Oh okay
 Oh okay
 Yeah
 Right
 Oh sure 
 Of course
 Que- you you're talking Queen 
 is that what you said
 Oh oh oh okay
 Right
 Well sure 
 because Queen was real popular when I was growing up
 Oh 
 Um uh *[[slash error]] Right 
 right 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 that that was a real good one
 Well that's true 
 They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that
 Of the Stones
 Yeah 
 I agree 
 That's the ne- 
 the older stuff is the best of it 
 The the new stuff's kind of more like today's rock and roll which I don't really care for today's rock and roll too much
 Right
 Yes 
 definitely 
 I agree
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 No 
 not yet 
 I guess I've been con- kind of considering it 
 Have you seen it yet
 Was it really good
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Oh okay
 So you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then
 Right
 Well no 
 now well seventies music I'm like I said yo- disco I don't like disco 
 *[[more than one utt]] I've never liked disco
 Well that's true 
 That's true 
 But I was more in the late seven- 
 well I shou- 
 like mid to late seventies like between seventy-five and and seventy-nine was more my era
 Well no 
 I'm going right now 
 But uh no 
 I didn't go then 
 But see I graduated high school in seventy-eight
 so you know in seventy-eight you know rock was starting to get really heavy you know 
 and real um I don't know 
 disco was pretty much dead by then
 So so that's what I mean 
 disco wasn't really my time
 About music
 Oh Okay
 Uh-huh
 That's kind of funny 
 You're right 
 I never thought of that 
 The disco years that's what they're calling them are gone
 Yeah 
 right
 That's true 
 Well except for Vietnam
 You know with 
 Yeah 
 Well that's very true 
 But 
 Oh good 
 I haven't even been keeping track
 Uh yeah
 We're kind of I was kind of in the middle of supper 
 but it's not a big deal
 I just left it 
 No 
 it's okay 
 because see I didn't see 
 somebody tried to call me last night 
 but I didn't have my number yet 
 I just got it today
 And so you know it's okay 
 I I told them I'd be available during this time 
 so anyway
 Okay 
 thanks
 Great 
 Bye
