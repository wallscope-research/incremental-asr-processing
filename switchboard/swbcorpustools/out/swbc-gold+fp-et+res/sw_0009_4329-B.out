 Okay
 Saginaw
 Really
 The rec- 
 we live in Plano 
 and they started off recycling by uh putting the 
 I think at each Wal-Mart they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that which now 
 I guess the uh city is has bought the big green trash cans 
 and uh we they have a recycling truck that comes around now 
 and you separate your glass and paper and uh aluminum 
 and you set it out 
 and they pick it up 
 and it it works real neat 
 They seem to be having a real good response
 So 
 Did they did they like on bottles did they give you a so many cents back for for cans 
 even or 
 Yeah
 No 
 I just I noticed it 
 Iowa and other cities like that it's a nickel per aluminum can
 So you don't see too many thrown out around the streets Or even bottles
 You know all kinds of bottles they they they really charge people to I guess when you purchase them and and then when you turn them back in
 I n- I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel
 Right
 So maybe that's one thing they can do
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Right
 That was my brother's first job in a grocery store 
 He was in the bottle area 
 It's pretty dangerous out there you know when they fall over 
 but but it's uh it's quite 
 they say that the green glass now that there's a big glut of green the green glass 
 yeah 
 It's amazing
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 it's 
 I notice the plastic have sort of faded away the milk jugs
 It it's 
 people just 
 they they really don't 
 uh there's too much labor involved I guess to separate the stuff
 It's 
 I don't know 
 it it can be 
 it's not as easy selecting you know clean junk as they say
 That's right 
 that's right 
 It's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher
 We all do it 
 Well it was nice talking to you
 Oh I think I think two or three minutes is fine
 Yeah
 Right
 Well we're doing it for a church choir 
 so 
 Yeah
 So 
 Well thank you
 Bye-bye
