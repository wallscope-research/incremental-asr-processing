 How are you 
 You want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget 
 That sounds kind of like me
 About the same thing
 Yeah
 I'm even in worse shape because I have eight children 
 and uh we live from hand to mouth 
 We hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not then we due for the next month
 A couple of times we've tried some things 
 and they worked 
 but I'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it
 The best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and uh took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope 
 and when the envelope was empty then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area
 And that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent
 It was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money 
 And we did that pretty successfully for about three months 
 and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope 
 and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I even find now like with the automatic tellers I'll go take money out of that
 and then I forget to take that out of my checking account
 And uh 
 So I I I leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and I figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there
 And I figure that gives me room for the mistakes I make
 Yeah
 But it was still running
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Not very often 
 That's right
 A lot of
