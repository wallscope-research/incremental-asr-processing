 Okay 
 uh what do you think about uh the idea of having volunteer service for everyone
 Well are you doing any kind of volunteer work now
 What about when when would people do it when they finished high school
 I think particular boys that the maturity 
 in fact I wasn't very mature when I left high school 
 and I think there's a there's a real challenge there 
 There's also this this issue of of uh you know whether you're really ready 
 and I think it gives a different perspective
 The only complication is is is how do you fund something like this
 Yeah 
 I think the Mormon church has sends out missionaries that 
 That's uh it's interesting 
 It gets them away from home and and gets them to do something useful 
 although the kids today though it it seems that almost that their concern for money 
 I we were doing some investigating colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in in trying to find a job study something that will give them a job as opposed to be curious be curious 
 as to if 
 if there was if there was mandatory you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary 
 do you think that would be reasonable
 Well but the the issue of of of which 
 what what would what would you find what would you have them do 
 You know there are a lot of people around with 
 there's a lot of unemployment right now 
 What would you have these people do if they were brought in
 Well yeah
 Or say say the volunteer 
 say that say that it was mandatory
 Yes 
 my father was in the C C C 
 Well it seems that there's some things like the uh the programs at least just go around and and and clean up streets and and and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things
 Yeah 
 in fact we we helped with uh oh Help To Help Humanities 
 and that was a that was a good experience 
 but you take the kids out 
 and and a lot of the buildings in downtown areas that that either need demolishing or need fixing up 
 so 
 it would be a good idea 
 Uh we've been doing this three or four minutes 
 I think that uh 
 do you have any other further comments
 Well it was good talking to you Betty
 Have a good night
