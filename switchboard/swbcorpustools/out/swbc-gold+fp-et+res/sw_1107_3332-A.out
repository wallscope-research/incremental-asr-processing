 Doug you want to start 
 You don't use any credit cards I don't imagine
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 do you use them a lot
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh well that's an idea 
 that's a thought 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 My husband loves them 
 Uh we do use them 
 Uh we try not to 
 but he he's one who believes in credit cards 
 and he uses them quite a bit
 He likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month 
 He he likes that
 Uh-huh
 And that's when you get into expenses
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Well sometimes you do come on bargains and that 
 and it's really useful
 And some places won't take you know like personal checks or cash even
 but they would take a credit card
 Uh-huh
 Right
 We 
 yeah 
 we have the same thing up here 
 so we don't deal where they do that 
 We cha- you know we go to places where they don't charge extra 
 Some of them charge five cents a gallon even 
 like the gas stations more 
 And uh we just try to avoid you know the ones that do that 
 we just don't uh go there because there's enough other ones around that don't charge you anything 
 extra because actually to me credit cards are the same as cash 
 to me they are anyway
 Right
 Right 
 yeah
 Yes
 Yeah 
 right
 Well I can't say we never have 
 Now we have you know at times made payments on our things 
 but we try not to 
 We try hard
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 because sometimes uh there's times when you may maybe couldn't take advantage of something
 but with a credit card you can 
 So 
 Uh
 Well I think we're narrowing it down actually 
 Uh uh like I said my husband likes them 
 and we have quite a few 
 but we really get when you get down to the nitty gritty there's probably three that we use most of the time
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Oh yes
 Well it's not every week 
 but you you do get them 
 They make it very readily available
 Almost too much so 
 But I re- I really don't like it the charges that you know 
 we try to limit look at that also 
 what they charge per year to use our money you know
 they're charging us to spend our money 
 and I I'm not real crazy about that 
 so we try to look at that also
 Uh-huh
 Right
