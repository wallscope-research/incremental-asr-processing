 Well uh typical lawn stuff 
 Saint Augustine uh with a little Bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas
 uh and really all I do to it is 
 uh in fact I didn't even fertilize it this year 
 I just mowed it 
 and I I mow it uh you know with a mulch mower so the the particles fall down
 Yeah
 I do it myself
 Have a lot of people trying to do it for me 
 Hey I need the exercise 
 so what the heck
 Hey you've got the right idea

 I had a had a small vegetable garden that uh 
 It did pretty well 
 it's it's like on the side the apron of the of the parkway out behind the garage
 and uh our our garages come in from the back you know from the alley 
 and uh it's it's a little piece of land over there 
 Well I had uh tomatoes and and uh uh peppers 
 and I had I had okra 
 and by the fence I had cucumbers which which didn't do real well uh
 they kind of came out looking like gourds
 But I had squash 
 I had zucchini and and yellow crook neck squash
