 Okay 
 so um 
 yes 
 we do keep uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago 
 we have a computer here at the house
 and I made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month 
 and then basically since then what I've done is is keep track of it through the checkbook 
 so that based on whatever we've got coming in the check coming in then how much I'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also spe- 
 because our house payment is once a month 
 that's our our biggest uh expense 
 so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck even thought it's really still there so that I can keep uh uh good balance a running total yeah through the month
 What do you all do
 Is it is it hard to keep track of it 
 or does it work out pretty well
 And and you're staying within your budget and keep- everything is working pretty good
 You don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that
 That's a good choice 
 we've been trying we're trying to uh do that this year 
 We've budgeted the money that we used to spend we were spending on a CODA account with T I and then money we were also buying stock with for that year 
 we've taken that this year and said we're going to pay off all of our credit cards 
 and uh we have uh another loan with the bank
 and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that we'll be free and clear
 That's good to be in that kind of shape
 What are you all trying to do long term
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 mostly what we're doing we've worked we've done the uh CODA account with T I where they we put in so much a month 
 and then they or so much a pay check and then they match it
 So that's that's worked out pretty good 
 and then I used to work for T I 
 and I have 
 when I retired from there or left I took the money I that I had in mine and put it in an I R A 
 and we had an out we had an existing I R A 
 so we have both of us have some money in an I R A that we're also trying to figure 
 to put it we're putting it in C D's right now
 and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund 
 Yeah 
 The other thing that we've done that that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies um 
 han- uh John Hancock company came out 
 and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and uh what we were pla- what what our uh goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house um special thing buying land and building our own house 
 and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at and then gave us a good idea back you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals and or not and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time
 Yeah 
 that that's the other financial thing I guess that we've done is with our life insurance is since I'm at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me 
 that's a a big thing to think about
 Okay 
 I guess that's most of my um financial plans right now
 Is is there anything you'd like to add
 Well it's been nice talking to you
 Bye bye
