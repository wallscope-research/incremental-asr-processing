 Well the uh 
 what I really I don't like is the ca- the constant calls people selling things people telling me I want things You know people trying to solicit for different you know organizations 
 You know that's what I really 
 Never stops ringing 
 right
 That's right 
 Well you know the the great uh thing for that it's uh is is an answering machine 
 this is this is the one of the best inventions ever you know
 you just switch that thing on 
 and uh 
 Yeah
 Um even in an office
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right 
 Uh-huh 
 I know 
 Oh yeah 
 uh well you know these people they sell your names 
 I mean 
 you know I 
 that's also an invasion of privacy 
 I think it the whole thing is uh
 Oh they do
 Well sure it is
 That's right 
 Well you know if you've ever gotten anything you know in your life your your name is somewhere 
 one magazine and boom they got your name forever
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Yeah 
 that's right
 Oh I'm from Texas
 Oh we're in Plano
 Well you know the only call I really got that well was out of state 
 I got one from Oklahoma City and one from California
 And that was uh California 
 I was thrilled to death because that's you know the furthest I'd gotten any call from you know 
 and um 
 Oh really
 Oh
 Yeah 
 see well that's uh the there was another call on Saturday Saturday that was also from uh that was the one from California 
 I don't know why I ask people on the weekends from out of state 
 or uh I don't know you know 
 but 
 Uh originally from New Jersey
 Yeah
 Oh really 
 what part
 Oh that's nice over there
 Yeah 
 we're from more uh from sort of towards the shore central New Jersey you know 
 we're like uh 
 Yeah 
 oh yeah 
 it was beautiful 
 that's why I I really miss it 
 I I don't really like it here at all 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 so they 
 Yeah 
 Well yeah 
 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 and then of course they call you know 
 before I got the answering machine it was ridiculous
 you know I said this is absurd 
 I you know I the minute I get home the phone would be ringing
 Oh it's great 
 
 Well you know in fact I've been missing calls from the T I switchboard 
 because I I always have it on you know 
 and I'll get that that message that says uh to uh um you know uh end this call press three
 and I assumed I you know it was from the switchboard
 You know 
 Yeah 
 it is because one day I listened you know and it was you know 
 but um I I just got totally disgusted 
 and then you know people asking for for money for everything you know 
 Exactly 
 and you know the policeman's associations
 Oh I used to do that
 Yeah 
 I used to do that 
 I'd send or three kids to the movies or something
