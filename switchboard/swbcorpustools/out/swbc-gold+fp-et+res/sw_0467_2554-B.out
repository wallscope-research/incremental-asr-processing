 Well um most of the stuff up until now in the recent months I I I don't have any problem with
 Uh it's 
 you know it 
 No 
 I agree with that As as far as the as far as the mess that's developing as a result um you know 
 as a country the United States uh 
 I think our hands are tied as far as as as any further involvement until the U N sanctions it 
 In fact it really was to begin with
 And uh I just I heard a comment on the radio this morning that uh you know it it gets to a point where uh if enough people are are going to be slaughtered over there over the the the internal problems um somebody may step in again
 But uh I really think it's it's a U N issue at that point because it is internal
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 that's right 
 Absolutely right 
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 these these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time 
 Some of them have been going on for for tens of years if if I understand it right in places like the Sudan and 
 Yeah

 There's no doubt about it 
 Uh-huh 
 Well and and and so many of the so many of the conflicts um really don't have a basis in in uh politics or or human rights or anything like that 
 It It's it's religious based 
 and uh you know by by self-proclamation this is a holy war 
 and it is right
 And then uh we we go on from there 
 and

 It it's 
 there's no doubt about it 
 and uh 
 That's right
 Uh-huh

 You bet 
 You bet 
 Well yeah 
 because there's no uh you know there's there's there's a complete different set of values
 Um there's there's different value placed on human life and uh right down the list you know possessions and and everything else
 And uh what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases
 Okay
 Yeah 
 Yeah
