 Okay 
 No 
 I had to press one
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 I think we should have stayed longer
 Uh I think what we did was good 
 but I think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do
 Yeah 
 I think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now 
 And it's almost like they're killing each other off 
 and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all <>
 Well I think I don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it um
 Well no 
 I just mean that that the world in general 
 Yeah 
 Um I don't know 
 I think we should have helped the the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more than rather than just quitting where we did
 Yes 
 But I think that's almost impossible next to impossible
 Oh see I haven't really been keeping up with them 
 so I really don't know what he said
 What did he say about it
 Uh-huh
 We don't have the money for that
 It would be really nice because I'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes 
 I dropped the phone 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 <> Uh-huh
 Oh I didn't realize that
 No 
 huh-uh
 Only in Ohio
 I've never been past Ohio
 No 
 huh-uh 
 I've never seen anything out I never seen the great 
 I've seen 
 I've never seen 
 I've seen pictures of it 
 but 
 I've never been there 
 I've seen pictures 
 I just I'm a college student 
 and um I'm paying for my own education 
 and I'm I come from a large family 
 and we we we're never able to take vacations because there's there's twelve kids in the family
 So 
 Oh my
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well um I'm I'm originally from Butler 
 and that's about an hour away from where I am now 
 I'm at Clairon 
 And um it's it's pretty like windy and hilly
 Oh I couldn't even tell you
 It's not like a mountain 
 It wouldn't be like a mountain 
 It's uh 
 Oh I don't even know 
 I have no clue
 I would say it's closer to sea level
 Uh-huh
 Oh well see um Uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Uh the farthest away from home
 Probab- I'd say five or six
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh my 
 Oh my Gosh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yes 
 Now see for me that's a long ways
 Uh-huh 
 Even well like I I'm in like a little town right now 
 It's smaller than Butler 
 and um Butler Butler is about an hour north east of Pittsburgh 
 So that will give you some idea of where I'm at
 And I'm about I'm about two hours north east of Pittsburgh
 And uh just this this little town here is basically a college town 
 The college without the college here this town would be nothing 
 It would be absolutely dead 
 Because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants 
 and and in the summer when we co- uh 
 my fianc3ee's family lives up there *[[typo]]
 we come up here in the summer 
 and it's 
 there's just no one around
 Um well I go home in the summer 
 and I work in the summer 
 and between what I make in the summer and student loans that's how I go to college
 Finance
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um well like I said my fianc3ee *[[typo]]/
 No 
 No 
 no 
 no 
 um my fianc3ee works down in D C *[[typo]]/
 and I'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or a something 
 I'd rather work for a company and um like be their financial advisor or something
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Uh-huh
 Take a boom a little bit
 Well well what would be the unemployment rate out there
 See that's what it is here too
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs
 I know people they are out of school for two or three years 
 and they have a job that has nothing to do
