 Well Julie uh are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with uh special care for elderly
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Is he able to uh still do everything himself pretty well
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 And I'm sure that kind of thing would influence your f- grandfather's feelings 
 Because uh I th- you know I think for a lot of people it really is the decision of <> do they still have some of their life left 
 And and for for I'm sure a lot of people going into a nursing home it's like saying my life is over 
 and I'm just here for the rest of the stay 
 And so I you know I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs 
 Yeah 
 they have can look after a lot of things 
 but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore 
 Uh I know my none of my grandparents were in a nursing home 
 They generally were able to have someone care for them at home 
 and they died <> 
 But they were all goodness younger than your grandparents 
 Like they were in their eighties That type of thing 
 Uh but I did uh you know I guess 
 uh when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to do take care of themselves physically Uh 
 And that's that's difficult part 
 Because I think what they often get used as is uh almost like a very high level or long-term care for uh similar to a hospital
 Uh I know like here in Saskatchewan we have our hospital care the care actually for the older people graded in level in four levels 
 And a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care Generally are not able to look after this- themselves to very to a very great extent physically 
 Often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's Disease <> or those or or physical and mental handicaps Uh you know where they really require twenty-four hour supervision of some kind Even though it may be minimal 
 And uh but I think that it can be helpful in that uh it gets people the level of physical care they need Uh
 Yeah 
 I th- and I think it happens more in areas where it's uh I guess uh a broad social medical system <> where uh you know there's government medical care and that kind of thing 
 If it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals 
 and and I guess that's sort of my lack of understanding 
 I think that a majority of the places in the U S uh you know there is some government aid available 
 but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay 
 And uh if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely
