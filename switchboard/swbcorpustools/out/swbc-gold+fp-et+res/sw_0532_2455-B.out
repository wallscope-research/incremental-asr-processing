 Have you been talking to males 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 this is this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 it it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore the women are spreading themselves thinner than before
 Uh-huh
 Do you work outside the home
 Do you have children
 Uh-huh
 Oh sure
 Right
 Yeah 
 I uh I think that while it's a good change for I think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel you know their expertise may be
 Uh I think sometimes other things suffer and tha- 
 I think it's hard to find a balance there
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I have little children four and one 
 and I decided that it was very important to me to stay home
 Uh and when I I I happen to you know be 
 I'm very active with uh people other people with children my age 
 and most of us do tend to stay home 
 but when I run into people that you know just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time I there's almost a uh friction between us
 Uh-huh 
 not people that are you know necessarily good friends Even though that has happened too uh 
 it's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence 
 You know w- 
 if you decide to go back to work then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself
 And if you don't then sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you're just wasting your time at home
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 No 
 that that's definitely true 
 In fact I I work out of my home 
 Um I'm an accountant
 and I do taxes and bookkeeping 
 and I uh 
 it was 
 it's a way for me to stay home
 And I still unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night
 but uh but it it's worked out for for my family to have my cake and eat it too kind of thing
 Well I I hope that they will change uh 
 but but I'm 
 I just 
 I know it's going to be a slow change 
 Uh I I feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner 
 I'm just thinking of my circle of people that I know 
 I know quite a few people who have decided to not have both both both uh couples you know both uh of the parents work
 And yet uh I I we- 
 I hope to see employer based you know helping out You know child uh care centers at the place of employment and and things like that that will help out 
 What do you think 
 do you think we are setting a trend
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 it's a very personal thing
 Yeah 
 I think it's hard though when you talk about about families and and raising children 
 because ch- I think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground 
 I think they uh they need security 
 and yet they 
 I don't know 
 I 
 from speaking from my children the- they aren't real flexible when it comes to things like that
 They uh they want to know things are going to be a certain way
 Uh-huh 
 right 
 Well we will see 
 I I'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society
 Oh yes 
 the the numbers are still very skewed to say the least
 Okay 
 you too Ellen
 Bye-bye
