 How should they do it 
 Why didn't it work last time
 Well I'm all for it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 they tried the 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 direct conversion
 I think they just ought to you know start uh just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever you know start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts 
 and you know people if they have to are going to learn to think that way
 They do 
 but things are generally packaged in the English sized packages you know 
 You buy a quart of milk 
 and sure it has has the metric equivalent written on there 
 but it still a quart
 But if they started putting it in liters liter of oil and you know liters of gasoline people are going to learn to think in metric 
 As long as you can still buy a product in the English units that's how you're going to think of it
 It figures
 Right
 That that's the problem
 Right 
 It's kind of hard for me to believe that this day and age 
 I don't know 
 when I was growing up we were talking metric system in school not not at first 
 but by the time I was in fifth or sixth grade anyway
 I would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age you know under the age of thirty or so to have some idea what it is anyway 
 A liter's about a quart
 Yeah
 Well thing is it's a global global market place these days 
 and you know we're like what one of two backwards countries in the world as far as 
 Something 
 I don't remember what the other one is 
 but 
 It's just time I think for for us to go over 
 Because all you end up doing is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international <> 
 I don't you know 
 I work for T I 
 we're all around the world 
 you have to perform this conversion anyway
 And 
 Right 
 Mils and microns
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 I remember that stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns 
 and ours were in mils
 And it got to you know 
 somewhere down the line they went standardized 
 they went microns 
 but uh you just you know you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs
 So 
 No
 Yeah
 Yeah
 About half a liter
 Yeah
 I would have more problem more problem with the temperature except that you know working in engineering we do everything in Centigrade or Celsius
 It's getting warm right 
 Yeah 
 it's about 
 Is about twice as much what it works out to
 One point eight times as many points 
 Yeah 
 so I I think as long as people have a choice they're going to stick with the American way
 And until we have to have to learn to think that way we won't
 Yeah 
 for the most part I think so
 Right
 Right
 He just get one more 
 Oh that would be a mess
 Right 
 It just gets bad 
 now you got to you got to have one and not mix them up
 Because you're never going to get to one one system if you still got a got a mix 
 And of course here that that would involve changing road signs all across the country you know miles per hour to kilometers per hour and the whole nine yards 
 Kind of hard to do gradually
 Yeah
 Hell you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 but they'd need they'd seem to be ticking off faster too
 Every road sign you come to is like well I don't know it that far
 Yeah 
 I think they 
 you got the problem with all your cars are still 
 yeah 
 you still got cars on the road that don't have both
 At that time anyway that was still when things were 
 the metric system was still not 
 You know now cars they have both 
 Sooner or later they'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way
 Yeah
