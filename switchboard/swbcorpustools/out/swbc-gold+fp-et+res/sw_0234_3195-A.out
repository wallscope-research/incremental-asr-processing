 Uh what i- what is your practice as far as budgeting 
 Do you manage the money
 Oh I see 
 That's how kind of I am too 
 Are you married
 You are
 I think the women for the most part end up managing the money 
 My husband always says he earns it and I have to spend only what he earns 
 It 
 Well I don't work outside of the home 
 and he always threatens that when I spend more than what's coming in I have to go back to work
 so I I manage it 
 Now do you actually follow a budget
 Well that's pretty much the way we do um we did in the past 
 I would say Uh 
 at this point our children are grown 
 and so I really don't have the obligations there any more that we have to balance to you know get things together for them 
 and I really just keep very good records 
 and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that 
 and I try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently
 uh I don't always succeed at that 
 I usually keep one with a low interest rate 
 and I put things on there that I think I'm not going to get to 
 and then I have another one 
 but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point we're in a new home and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to
 so I'm still getting used to that 
 but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead
 and we do not buy us new cars 
 Uh do you get into car 
 We do for us very much so 
 In fact we are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just don't go to a new car you know whatever 
 and I said look you guys are all into car payments 
 we haven't had car payments for so many years 
 I love it this way 
 and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked 
 and it has eighty-two thousand miles on it
 and we were kept saying wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it
 Believe it or not we did we found one one newer
 the worst part is it's the same color
 and so everybody's saying you're kidding you have two cars the same 
 and I said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again 
 I said well we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it
 and it's an eighty-five 
 and so I said Hey this was a cinch 
 we paid for the car 
 and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on
 This is for all the long running back and forth on you know interstate driving and things 
 and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years or next year probably
 Generally from dealers 
 and uh it depends because I don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual uh unless we we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell
 you know we were going up to a larger one 
 but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer and we always make a deal 
 I mean we have walked out of more dealerships saying don't bring us the manager and all of that unless you want to bring him right away 
 You're going to get one shot at us
 we will you know 
 and they say Well you're kidding you know 
 I s- 
 no
 this is the price we're going to give you out the door 
 We don't want to hear about taxes
