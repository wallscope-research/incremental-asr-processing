 Okay 
 so do you do a lot of cooking in your family
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 do you like to cook
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Oh really
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 but that's neat though because you get to have different stuff 
 Yeah 
 I'm a pretty bad cook 
 I'm pretty bad 
 My husband is really good 
 he put himself through college working in restaurants
 And uh he's much better cook than I am 
 so when I was home I still cooked a lot 
 and I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff 
 And now I went back to work about a year and a half ago 
 so one of the things that he took over was the cooking 
 and the kids are thrilled 
 they're really happy that I don't cook anymore
 Yeah 
 they say oh dad let dad cook mom 
 let him do it 
 But um so do you have kids 
 You obviously have one
 Okay 
 you have two
 Two and half oh
 I was just going to say <> makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it 
 Or are you not at that stage yet
 Yeah
 Right
 Oh yeah 
 Oh my gosh 
 Oh my gosh 
 I couldn't 
 Yeah 
 Boy I couldn't do that 
 I 
 What's that 
 Oh really 
 Oh yeah 
 what is that Saint Jack or something
 Scallops Saint something 
 or yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Really 
 with scallops
 No 
 no 
 I'm from New England 
 so we had um a lot of seafood before we moved down here
 And uh that sounds delicious to me
 That sounds great
 we're just thinking of having a uh dinner party 
 We went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game 
 they had uh a murder mystery
 and you came dressed as one of the characters 
 and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner
 and it was really fun 
 and so you know we were going to try doing it ourselves 
 but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table 
 and that kind of interrupted the game 
 so I was thinking there's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I've tried before that's pretty good 
 and then you can make that ahead 
 and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready
 So that's uh 
 Yeah 
 Uh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 I know 
 my husband did too 
 His parents are Austrian 
 and they uh always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 Oh my gosh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Oh gosh 
 so do you 
 Oh they did the 
 That you do 
 right 
 right 
 that's just part of it
 Yeah 
 my family didn't 
 but when I got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that 
 but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly 
 he never 
 There was dishes that he really enjoyed eating
 there were several things that he liked 
 but it never was really something that he would have chosen 
 It's just that I cooked 
 so he had to put up with it 
 but there was one thing that he couldn't stand 
 and that was soybeans 
 I tried it like once or twice 
 and he just could not eat it 
 so I never 
 I had 
 I was limited 
 I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans 
 but 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 That's true 
 Yeah 
 some of the stuff is good 
 but it was a tremendous amount of cooking 
 Because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete
 and we had little kids at the time you know 
 when I was home with them and it was just so much cooking 
 I don't like to cook
 And I'm not really that great at it 
 so it just turned out to be too much cooking 
 So <> well I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there
 He's set 
 oh okay
 Okay 
 Do you like to bake at all 
 or do you get into that 
 Yeah 
 Really 
 no kidding 
 Yeah 
 then be gone 
 I know 
 that's the thing about baking 
 I don't mind baking at all 
 and I can do a pretty good pie 
 we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother 
 and my mother taught me how to make it
 I can make a pretty mean pie 
 but um I don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening 
 We had the same kind of problem 
 If you make homemade bread
 it's supposed to save you money 
 but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat 
 It tastes so good
 Oh uh yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 uh-huh 
 I've heard of it 
 but I've never done it
 That sounds pretty good
 Yeah 
 oh yeah
 Yeah 
 and then you make the bread 
 but you pinch off a portion or save a portion of it for the next time or something
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 I know it always sounded 
 I don't know how safe that was 
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 that's got to kill anything I guess 
 but 
 All right 
 well yeah 
 thanks 
 Plano
 Yeah 
 Plano in Texas
 Are you in Texas
 No kidding 
 gosh it sounds so close
 Yeah 
 I thought for sure you were in Dallas or something
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yes 
 they're trying to get all different amount of people 
 Well gee my husband is from Richmond 
 and I went to U V A 
 that's where we went
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Oh you did 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 boy we'd like to get back over to the East Coast 
 I'll tell you
 It's nice over there
 Oh really
 Oh yeah 
 no kidding 
 Well things are doing pretty good down here 
 we tried to move over to Raleigh last year 
 and there was such little going on in Raleigh you know 
 you couldn't get a job to save yourself over there 
 so we decided we'll try in a couple of years 
 but business is 
 Yeah 
 you probably could 
 Okay 
 well it's good talking to you
 Take care
 Bye
