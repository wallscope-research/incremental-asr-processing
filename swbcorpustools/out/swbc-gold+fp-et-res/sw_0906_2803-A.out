 Okay 
 Um I think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service 
 because it seems like 
 and I'm thinking of people that are in jail now 
 I think that maybe if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done 
 because they understand people more 
 they understand helping people more 
 they understand the plight of people
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I would think that for like people that are just filthy filthy rich 
 I think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they can see 
 and I'm speaking about people that are like born rich
 and that's all they know
 and I'm thinking that community service would help them uh just get a feel of what else is out there how other people are living you know 
 if they were to work in I don't know a soup kitchen or something they would understand how other people live 
 and uh you know on the same note if poorer people uh are working to serve the community I don't know they probably have a better perspective of life itself
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh
 demeanor 
 yeah 
 uh-huh
 Right
 That's great
 Uh-huh 
 and I think that that you know 
 this on the same note being 
 he was exposed to that 
 and maybe he wasn't before
 and now he sees
 and I think that anybody that works in some kind of service or for the community or something they can see you know 
 you can't know what you don't see you know 
 and you have to experience some things 
 You know a lot of people know that other people are poor 
 but they don't know what poor is unless they actually see it and you know help or something
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 There's something I've really be skeptical of you know 
 you watch television 
 you'll see the service announcement for children in other countries 
 and if you want to send like you know fifty cents a day or something like that 
 and you can help a child
 I don't know I guess it's just me 
 but I don't know whether to trust that or not 
 I mean there are so many scams and things going on you know 
 I would love to help somebody you know
 but I can't bring myself to trust this company who is trying to do this or whatever it is you know
 I don't know just today people are just so money hungry that I think they would do anything
 and so you don't know what they 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 More self-centered uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 But you can't do that today
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Even when I first moved to Dallas from New York it seemed like Dallas was so open you know 
 everybody left their doors open 
 you just run in the store 
 you leave your car running you know 
 and this was only uh 
 well I guess it has been awhile 
 it's been almost ten years since I moved here
 And it's amazing now how much it's changed 
 I don't go outside at night you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh God 
 that would be the exact opposite of here
 if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 That is sad
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's a big thing with me 
 I live in a one bedroom 
 I'm single
 and I could live in an apartment 
 I live in Waco okay
 and you either live in really low priced housing or you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments
 And I live 
 I don't make a lot of money 
 but I live in the high price apartments simply because I feel safe here
 and I'm paying probably the hundred or hundred fifty dollars more than I would be paying somewhere else 
 but I wouldn't be able to sleep at night
 and that to me is worth the extra money for me to be you know 
 I feel very safe where I am you know 
 instead of 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Huh-uh
 Yeah 
 they don't even consider it 
 Uh-huh
 To 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 I was talking to someone yesterday about that 
 And we were saying that uh the basic family is disrupted these days
 And so I think you know before the father would work 
 and the mother you know would stay home 
 and having that mother there that base I think was a big part of family a big part of what you know your uh youngsters thought about what they did you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 When I call 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
