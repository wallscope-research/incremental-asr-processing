 Oh boy probably uh robberies people stealing from each other
 Is that what happens up there a lot 
 Uh that's mostly what I hear though is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen 
 That's the most prevalent crime Uh you know the ones that really add up after a while I guess you know far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs 
 You know everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually
 Oh well yeah 
 that is a crime 
 I guess uh when you count all the little things that people do like 
 uh speeding is a crime 
 I break that law every day 
 Uh-huh
 Well uh I've been caught with marijuana before 
 so I guess that was a crime 
 I got a year's probation for that 
 but uh 
 No 
 it wasn't that big a deal 
 Uh when I think of crime I think of stuff that affects other people like people getting you know killed or raped 
 I think rape is one of the worst crimes 
 Yeah 
 it's very degrading
 and Yeah
 Yeah 
 right 
 once a person's you know gone then it's 
 but the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life you know
 Well for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders I think the death penalty is 
 it's a pretty good thing
 they have that down here in Florida still 
 the electric chair 
 and uh 
 Oh do they 
 Yeah 
 I think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy 
 and I guess usually they're always sure they got the right guy 
 but uh 
 Yeah 
 so do I
 Yeah 
 if that 
 You know the sooner 
 a year's plenty of time you know for something to come out I guess 
 Then you know there's been guys in jail for six years 
 and the other guy admits that he did it 
 and they 
 it's like oops 
 But Uh-huh
 Right
 Um yeah 
 I don't know if it would or not though 
 I don't think it's so much of a deterrent as it is uh a good way for vengeance you know for the relatives and family members 
 you know what I mean
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it kind of gets it off their chest
 Yeah 
 I know that lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other 
 And they're kind of like crimes of passion and stuff like that 
 I don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead 
 but you might be able to uh stop people you know 
 they're thinking about it 
 they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught 
 Right
 Yeah
 That's right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 they could probably do it again
 That's right 
 they didn't have any time doing it the first time
 No 
 it do-
