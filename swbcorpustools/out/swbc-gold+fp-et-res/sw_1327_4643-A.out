 You interested in woodworking
 Um What kind of 
 pine
 Uh-huh 
 I guess he's young 
 Oh he'll be delighted
 Did you do it with a jigsaw 
 or do you have powered you know 
 Um
 Well I am interested in woodworking 
 I don't have lots of tools 
 Our local schools have adult education in the evening
 uh and I use their tools [[a- + an- ] + and ] some of their guidance 
 I'm an artist
 And I'm very handy 
 and you know if I touch it it turns into something usually 
 [ I'm + *[[slash error]] Uh well actually I'm ] very you know 
 *[[slash error]] I have a Master's degree 
 and my projects had to do with acrylic painting 
 but I'm really interested in the crafts
 I make stain glass 
 I've done some silver jewelry making 
 and I kind of 
 once I get you know really pretty good at something I want to try something else 
 Yeah 
 well no 
 actually I get good enough to sell it or have people say oh wow 
 you didn't buy it 
 you made it
 And then it's like well the thrill is gone 
 so let's do something else
 Well yeah 
 I'm signed up for a class in pottery making because I've never tried that yet
 but 
 Well I actually have a Masters of art 
 and it's in art education
 So I'm a licensed teacher 
 but jobs being what they are I substitute teach
 and that way I have time for my kids too 
 And I've been fortunate that I can afford to work part-time 
 I don't know how long that's going to last 
 And uh they're cutting back 
 so I don't go in all that often 
 but I've been real interested in some of those cute country kind of things
 Uh I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars 
 and I say oh no 
 and I go 
 and I make it
 That's how I started jewelry making 
 I love to cook
 And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas [and + and ] knife and a fork and all kinds of stuff
 and I went 
 and I signed up for class because then again you you know get someone to guide you 
 and you get the tools you don't feel like buying
 And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars 
 It took me a lot of time 
 but it didn't 
 but if it cost me twenty dollars you know 
 and then I 
 Yeah 
 Then I saw one of these country looking wood watermelons 
 It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it
 Oh yeah 
 Uh-huh
 I went there 
 we have Home Depot out here 
 I don't know if you've heard of it 
 I went 
 and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon 
 I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath 
 and cutting that wedge out was no joke 
 [I had a + uh I did it ] through Adult Ed again
 I did it through Adult Ed again
 And the teacher was one of these negative people 
 oh that's dangerous 
 we can't do that 
 we just can't do that 
 And I'm going well how about this way 
 I want to do that 
 that was the plan here 
 So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it
 Well the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw 
 but there's no coping saw big enough for a fourteen inch wide watermelon that 
 and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw 
 I said I'm not that steady 
 it's not going <> to happen
 So we built a cradle for it 
 and once it was turned we got one cut out on the radial saw 
 by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about 
 So 
 Uh I'd say it's about an eighth 
 You know jus-
