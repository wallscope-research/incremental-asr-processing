 Oh this is kind of tough 
 I don't too often watch you know shows that are on on a regular bases
 I don't have a lot of time 
 and I don't really like some of them to tell you the truth
 I don't thing they have any redeeming value
 But uh oh I watch things like uh SIXTY MINUTES every week 
 Uh ugh 
 it's kind of tough to think of some of the others Although I do watch some of some of those frivolous things 
 Uh like on Thursday nights at nine o'clock when I get home from aerobics I will watch uh KNOTS LANDING 
 Yeah 
 just something like that for you know uh end of the evening type of thing 
 but uh How about you
 Yeah 
 I don't get that so I don't have that choice
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 But there's a couple of those I've seen once in a while
 uh I can't think of the name of the one that has the uh military uh fellow
 he's playing a military part 
 He's the husband of the girl on DESIGNING WOMEN
 Yeah 
 you know it was on one time when I saw it 
 and you know it it's pretty cute
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 no 
 I don't 
 I guess uh there's some uh things on Channel Thirteen that I watch pretty regularly
 On Saturdays they have uh a variety of things uh 
 and a lot of times I record it and watch it some other time 
 But uh they have programs on uh house repairs and how to build things 
 and um they have a calligraphy show 
 and I do calligraphy so I watch that
 And um they have a lot of cooking shows
 And oh you know I'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those 
 I don't sit and watch them but I enjoy some of it especially if I'm uh cooking on a Saturday evening or something
 and one of those kind of inspires me
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we do some of that
 In fact I probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on T V than you know other kinds of things
 Yes
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 those are pretty good 
 I like those old ones much better than some of the new stuff
 Yeah 
 And boy 
 the movie can be unbelievable
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 I'm not that hung up to most things
 if I miss something big deal 
 Yeah 
 That's true
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 We do too 
 Too many other things to do and too much going on
 Right
 Right 
 I agree
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Okay 
 Well we probably exhausted that huh
 Okay 
 I enjoyed talking to you
 Okay
 Good-bye
