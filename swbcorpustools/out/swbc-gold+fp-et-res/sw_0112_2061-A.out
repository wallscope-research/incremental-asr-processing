 Hello
 Hey how you doing
 Fernando
 Wait 
 Let me turn off my stereo here 
 Because I've been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 What time is it over th- 
 are you in Dallas
 Are you
 Because every time I got through I went to Dallas Texas
 Yeah 
 I'm in North Carolina
 On the other coast 
 What 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 It's uh 
 I'm watching SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE here
 wait 
 how did you get to know about the T I thing
 what are you working on 
 Really 
 I'm doing my Masters in computer science and computer engineering
 At North Carolina State University
 Uh I don't Because uh I come from a bigger city than this one 
 and I'm in Raleigh 
 and 
 Yeah 
 That area 
 And it's really small 
 all you have is like towns built around universities
 Like Chapel Hill
 Yeah 
 Where you at
 Oh okay 
 so it's like this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people 
 and that's about it
 Yeah
 Oh okay
 so where do you go 
 Do you go to Berkeley
 Oh okay 
 Because uh I was looking at the doctorate degree in computer science center at Berkeley 
 And they're asking like for a uh G P A of like three point seven or something like that 
 And like they're looking like for uh G R E like ninety-nine percentile and this and that 
 And it's like 
 Yeah 
 I know 
 that's why I didn't apply 
 for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety-nine percentile on the verbal part 
 Yeah
 So are you going to go for your Doctorate
 Yeah
 When do you get out
 Oh okay 
 uh but what if they pay for it
 What if they pay for
 Yeah
 Because I know a couple of people here that work for uh the Army Uh 
 I think they're military 
 But the guy is still in
 And uh uh he works over in Maryland 
 And so he's doing his Masters here 
 They gave him like a scholarship like for a year
 And he's doing it in like in a year and a summer
 And so he's getting that 
 and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that 
 That's why you want to join
 But uh this guy 
 you can earn a lot more money 
 so you say 
 I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you've get your Masters
 They go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it 
 so 
 Yeah 
 But you 
 the 
 once you get your Masters you can be earning anywhere between like thirty-seven forty-five thousand a year
 and that's not what they're paying
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I know 
 Yeah 
 But that's uh 
 Yeah 
 it's like uh in I B M 
 In I B M you can get certain points
 and uh everyone's a manager 
 But nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money 
 Yeah 
 It's like 
 no 
 I B M is like 
 there's a joke about I B M which says you know it's like uh 
 all the major companies get into a boating race right
 And so I B M says well we have to have a team right
 And then they come in last 
 and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right Because the person asked for it
 Saying 
 he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right
 So he goes uh have you come up with a solution 
 They go yeah 
 change the rower 
 You know it's like everyone's a manager 
 but you know it's like like one person does the work 
 so 
 Yeah 
 So 
 Yeah 
 Well that's the way it works 
 that's why they're having problems 
 everyone's a manager 
 and 
 Yeah 
 it's like the people that actually do the work there are uh very few 
 And then the other people just plan it you know 
 it's like have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express with uh the think tank You know 
 like all these people are just sitting around just going you know like what shall we do 
 Has anybody thought of anything
 No 
 And then this guy from Federal Express comes along 
 They go what's that This track which it's going around the world 
 and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time
 And so it's like the same thing with I B M You know 
 so they have this think tank 
 And they got to come up with ideas 
 But see uh the thing is that I B M is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff 
 Yeah
 And it fails 
 and you're dead 
 Yeah 
 Well I B M doesn't fire anybody 
 Because uh what they do is they put you in a different job Which you actually are like sitting around not doing anything 
 So you quit
 that's their policy 
 They never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally
 Yeah 
 like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that 
 But they won't let you off 
 What they'll do is like 
 suppose you know like you're a manager 
 So they'll put you into keeping up the paper you know 
 It's like how much paper is going in 
 And then you say that's not my job 
 so you quit
 Right 
 Right 
 Right 
 No 
 but it's like they have just like different policy 
 I don't know 
 My dad works for them 
 but it's like I B M like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know 
 It's like they won't say 
 Yeah 
 Because see what happens is they have a good backup policy
 And anybody can fix it
 And so that's what you're going to go for
 and you know it's like for example like Leading Edge
 Have you ever heard of Leading Edge
 What
 they made like uh small personal computers
 I don't know 
 I don't know 
 But what they did I don't know is buy all the parts that I B M would throw away And build an I B M P C with all the parts that I B M would throw away
 Yeah 
 for example you test a chip 
 It can't last seven years 
 but it can last five 
 I B M says let's throw it away 
 Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you
 And so that's 
 they're still around I think
 So that's what they do 
 They buy all the things that I B M throws away 
 and that's why they're so compatible Because 
 and by the time you have computer for five years you're going to throw it away anyway You know 
 Well there's like well 
 in a way you realize 
 one of my teachers got this computer which you know 
 it's like uh voice uh synthesizing stuff
 And he got that 
 He said you know it's like uh 
 I was testing it 
 *[[ LISTEN to this sequence that begins here and ends with A215 utt 11 I can't tell how much Speaker A is quoting and how much he'she is directly addressing Speaker B]] and it was wonderful 
 And then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory
 And I want more you know 
 And it's like Jesus Christ you know 
 it's like why do you want more 
 Because it's like one second of recording 
 you put into Wave 
 and you want to correct the errors into Wave 
 it takes so much 
 it's like 
 of course it does 
 by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model 
 and you put it in there 
 and you want to correct those 
 And then you know you're trying to make the Wave smooth 
 so you can approximately 
 of course it's going to take a lot 
 imagine what it is for us to make mark off models you know 
 It's like Jesus Christ 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well like they say like nobody can get enough you know 
 It's like once you have something 
 and it's like 
 I was watching this program on T V yesterday 
 In nineteen seventy-six NASA came up with Three D graphics 
 Right
 And they were showing this like Three D graphics view of like 
 What 
 No 
 no 
 no 
 this is like video game stuff 
 Okay 
 But the only thing was that it was just lines 
 okay 
 Like if you
