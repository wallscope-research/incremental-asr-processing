 the first one is we need people in there that understand uh numbers The numbers that are being thrown around when we're talking in trillions of dollars Uh which is an astronomical sum 
 and the people that are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means
 The elected people 
 Yes 
 Uh-huh
 our Senate and Congress and people that deal everyday and what's going to be done with those monies um and don't really understand what that is or how a budget even works
 Uh we need to elect people that are more uh 
 or 
 Well let's make them have a degree in uh economics 
 Well 
 Yeah 
 but people that understand the value of a dollar 
 um and wh- 
 in 
 the uh lobbyists needs them to be eliminated uh from Congress Um 
 They don't make pragmatic decisions 
 They make a decision based on constituency instead of a decision based on what they really believe
 Um you know or they tack on this uh pork bellies and do things that are good for their area to pass something that is not good for the country
 Oh I definitely would 
 Yeah 
 Get rid of them
 Totally Uh
 I think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that and be registered with what they ever contribute 
 But they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them
 that's a conflict of interest as far as I'm concerned
 When you are talking again uh billions and trillions of dollars uh you're jeopardizing the future of the country uh for today 
 That 
 I think to bring it in line you are going to have to have a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line 
 You can't ease into it 
 It took years and years to build up the momentum that's there now
 Uh I forget the figures on the interest rate 
 but it's something like uh hundreds of thousands of dollars a second in interest
 Part of the problem is we don't loan from ourselves 
 we buy from intimate international banking 
 That's why we have interest
 and I really feel that is part of the problem that we've let things get so out of control that we don't want to put the brakes on them
 by having a budget that is reasonable 
 Oh of course 
 Sure 
 And then add on to it 
 You take the gross national income and you say our budget is X number of percent of this gross national income 
 One thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax Across-the-board 
 everyone no matter what pays a ten percent income tax
 Uh 
 That's right 
 Right 
 No deductions 
 You pay a ten percent income tax
 That's what you pay 
 if you make forty million dollars uh then you're going to pay four million
 I- 
 if you make forty dollars you're going to pay four dollars 
 and that's it
 I don't know that it would or wouldn't
