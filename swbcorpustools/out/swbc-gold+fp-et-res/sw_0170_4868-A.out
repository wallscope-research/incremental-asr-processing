 Budgeting activity in our household is uh uh kind of an informal kind of situation 
 we you know put 
 actually what happens uh is my check gets automatically deposited 
 I don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore 
 It just gets deposited 
 and my wife you know you know looks at all those bills that come in 
 you know and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them You see 
 and so our budgeting 
 we really don't have a formal budgeting situation 
 Every time I've ever tried one uh I've just got wrapped in my inertia 
 And uh I've just decided not to pursue it 
 Uh what's your budget situation
 You know well actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets Isn't it
 Uh-huh
 Well my parents too 
 you were born in the late thirties or early forties 
 Yeah 
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Well that's good
 Well we buy what well 
 we just got through buying a twenty-five foot refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and a new dishwasher
 and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge Along with my trip to Japan which was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars 
 and you know 
 Right 
 we got a monster you know bill coming in 
 but we also have zero interest being paid 
 And we pay it off as it goes
 Yeah 
 So we never really get that much uh over extended
 Huh
 Yeah 
 we're doing that 
 We have you know uh 
 this is our big uh 
 we did redecorating 
 you know two new pieces in the family room and new carpet 
 uh we've just been spending spending spending
 but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year 
 So you know we don't have that 
 Yeah 
 uh it's about time that we did that 
 But the terrible part about it I've looked at it all 
 *[[ Seems to be clearly 2 slash units ]] and it all looks still pretty good to me 
 why we need to replace it
 but unfortunately my wife really <> feels as though it's just been an inappropriate uh thing to 
 that rug is thirteen years old 
 why not replace it 
 uh I say it might go for another thirteen 
 but uh too late we'll never find that out
 And 
 You know I don't spend that much money 
 uh we just sort of have had uh you know too many obligations to you know 
 we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they got through school 
 And that was the major you know decade of expenses you know 
 So we feel as uh 
 but as far as any formal budgeting uh you know we just apparently have been very fortunate 
 When we want to go out to eat we go out to eat 
 We never really you know have to program money for that or make choices you know 
 But uh we don't have that uproarious a lifestyle 
 After all we're
