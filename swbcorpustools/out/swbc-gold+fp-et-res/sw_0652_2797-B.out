 Well I think I don't know how your schools work back there 
 but we support our schools here with property taxes
 And the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax 
 So if you're renting a house or doing anything else you're not actually contributing to the education of your children 
 And I think that's wrong 
 I think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system 
 So as it turns out we don't really have a tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 No 
 huh-uh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 you would be
 Oh
 Yeah
 Oh
 Gee
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh well that's pretty good
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 Gee whiz
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yow
 Yeah
 No 
 huh-uh
 Well they say that Texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation 
 That our high school graduates can't even match the national average
 So you know our school system down here is no where near perfect 
 but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 they need to take things at their own speed
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think it'd be a lot better*[[note period needs slash unit]] You know each child has to learn at his own rate 
 they can't keep force feeding things to each other or you know at the kids
 Uh-huh 
 because he can't do it
 And it's not that he can't do it 
 he just can't do it quite as fast 
 or 
 Yeah
 All right
 Yeah
 Um
 Uh-huh
 All right
 Um all right
 Jumped on out there
 That's good
 Yeah 
 I did too up until ninth or tenth grade
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and see when I was a kid growing up and going to high school if I wanted to take a little electronics course I had a electronics course I could take 
 but we lived out in the country
 and we didn't have all that fancy stuff to worry about you know 
 we had our auto shop out there and our ag shop 
 and you know we had just about every thing that we needed 
 but they don't have it anymore 
 There's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore 
 our oldest boy goes to Lubbock High down here 
 and they go to school four and half days a week 
 so That's pretty weird
 No
 Uh-huh
 Gee
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I can imagine
 Yeah 
 that would be quite a shock
 Uh-huh
 Oh like Four H then
 All right
 All right
 Yeah 
 just something you do everyday
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 just something I have to do everyday
 That's good 
 our oldest boy went into school politics and made vice
