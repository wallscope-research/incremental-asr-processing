 Uh I guess 
 I don't know 
 It's the first time I've made a phone call on it
 Right
 I read uh a lot of Steven King Dean R Koontz uh some Danielle Steel 
 My aunt got me hooked on those 
 So I 
 Yeah 
 they're all novels
 I'll read some uh classic too
 Uh like THE GRADUATE by Steinbeck 
 I'll uh 
 A ROSE FAMILY by Faulkner That's one of my favorites
 Oh and this is more of a play or something that it was from that I saw 
 and I read the book from that
 And by the way my name's Bill 
 I'm from North Carolina 
 Uh I 
 let's see 
 What kind of books do you like to read
 I really have to be in the mood
 I read one like maybe once a year
 I'm not as 
 I've never read anything by him
 Yeah
 Okay
 I like to read a lot of non fiction history when Civil War era and that kind of thing
 I found that real interesting 
 I'm reading THE LION AND THE WIND right now 
 And that was on T V
 It was uh during Teddy Roosevelt's time And uh about a American woman that got kidnapped in uh Morocco
 Uh this is when they were having their revolution or whatever 
 and Teddy Roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a kind of a crazy man you know

 Well just like one quote that he had was that he thought the America's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle
 and it should be a grizzly bear because 
 you know like the grizzly and stuff like that 
 So it's 
 I saw the movie 
 and that's what made me want to read the book
 Candice Bergen was in the movie 
 I'm a real big fan of hers 
 so 
 Uh-huh 
 I like to read some of the philosophy stuff
 Yeah 
 I think that 
 I'm fascinated by that
 Yeah 
 I'm fascinated by that
 That 
 and uh even stuff about not like ghost stories but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses 
 I like 
 I'm kind of a doubting Thomas 
 and I like to read stuff like that 
 Some of it really freaks me out 
 And I like to read some self help books like uh 
 I read DIANETICS once I got past all the gibberish on it
 It was okay 
 it took me a while to really get into it 
 it didn't help me that much 
 But uh I think once you're set in your ways you're set in your ways
 Uh then I 
 one real interesting book I read recently was when I was looking for a job 
 I read HOW TO GET THE JOB THAT YOU WANTED 
 and it had real good tips 
 and it 
 and I got the job that I wanted by applying the methods that
