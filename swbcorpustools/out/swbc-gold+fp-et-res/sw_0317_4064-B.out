 I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently Uh
 In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that's presented 
 I have uh very little regard for the law presently practiced
 I was thinking primarily criminal cases
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 That's a concern of mine 
 Uh I would feel more comfortable in many cases I think with judges Uh you know doing the sentencing
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 my question I guess are they really your peers
 Uh <> Uh too often I think they are not
 and uh when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have you know that is a matter of concern to me too 
 Uh I think that uh in such cases uh they are not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased
 Uh now I happen to know several judges 
 and there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury I would feel a little bit uneasy about
 but the other two I feel uh would give either you know the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law
 And I guess that's what I am concerned with
 Uh-huh
 This is very true
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and you do see such uneven sentencing you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such where uh it would appear the crimes were very similar 
 but one individual got twenty-five years 
 and the other one was sentenced to life 
 So 
 Uh
 Isn't that the truth 
 There are times when [ is it + uh 
 oh goodness my mind has gone blank it's ] uh Othello 
 You know where he says kill all the lawyers 
 Every now and then one is tempted to see what 
 But it's taken me a long time to understand that uh lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice you know as novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice
 Uh-huh
 And they are very effective too
 Uh even 
 I have been involved uh just slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty
 but uh his attorneys gotten him off
 Uh the city has dropped their charges against him because the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge 
 So I don't know
