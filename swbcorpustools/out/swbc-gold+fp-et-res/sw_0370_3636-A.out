 Uh what sort of camping do you like to do the most
 Huh rough type huh 
 Okay
 Oh yeah 
 motor homes can be a lot of fun
 Yeah
 Uh that can be a lot of fun too
 Yeah
 Well so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping
 This summer we went to uh the Smokey Mountain National Park And uh stayed about three or four days in there 
 It was wonderful
 Nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable
 And the days were nice and warm 
 and it was beautiful beautiful few days
 It worked out particularly well especially considering she was what six months pregnant
 So I don't know 
 it worked pretty well 
 It was one of those dome type pop up tents
 Nice and quick and easy to put up
 Packs away nice and small 
 and about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto
 It was a lot of fun
 Oh yeah
 Wow 
 that's got to be beautiful territory
 Yeah
 What like Sequoia National Park
 Uh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Do they still have uh the scenic uh roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees
 Okay
 No 
 so far New Orleans is far west as I've gotten Well New Orleans and uh Minneapolis
 Oh yeah
 We're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 They seem to be trailing out quickly
 Yes
 I imagine
 I would imagine they are
 Yeah
 Uh not a whole lot of forestry down there is there
 Oh
 Place is forested with those concrete trees
 Yeah
 Well I guess that's God's place too 
 Anyway Uh what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping
 Three weeks
 Yeah 
 the whole family then was in on this
 Yeah
 That would have to be a blast
 What 
 well you went out from Texas up into that area
 Yeah
 Okay
 Oh wow
 Okay 
 Big Sur Highway that's uh where you're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time aren't you
