 All set 
 Do you want to start
 Sure go ahead
 Do they have many buildings that have security there
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well I went to Dallas uh when I worked for T I in Abilene 
 and uh I'm a little familiar with the city area Forest Lane and you know through that off the freeway
 And uh it didn't seem like it was that congested in that part 
 You know because to me where we live out here in the north east there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
 and the cities are very populated with tenement housing where there are more than one family in a house with the uh people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language 
 and uh they're going to the big cities 
 It makes it very difficult
 It really does 
 and I've seen the same thing that you're talking about uh much more crime than ever before Drugs of course uh a big part of it I think
 And uh I don't know 
 a lot of younger people you know into more violent crimes
 that's really sad you know 
 you got young boys or girls that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and no remorse what so ever
 Yeah
 It is 
 and I don't know if it's uh the family you know thing where they're not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and the kids aren't getting the attention that they need or the television
 And I really think that we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people
 Uh uh
 Yeah exactly
 And uh you know they had uh 
 in fact on the news last night we were watching this uh man who lost his ten year old daughter 
 He ran out to the store for a few minutes 
 and he had left her home alone 
 Sh- now ten years old 
 she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes you know
 And while he was gone he had went looking for a job and stopped at the store 
 that's what it was 
 And uh someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets these two men went in raped the girl murdered her and the whole bit 
 And one of the men got uh I think it was seventeen years 
 and the other one was in for uh life imprisonment
 The one that was in for the seventeen years actually served seven 
 and he's out
 And the man said that you know if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself And then go to McDonalds and have a hamburger and not think a thing about it
 And I think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands And that innocent people 
 I shouldn't say innocent because actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances 
 but 
 the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it you know it's like two different things
 Sometimes when you lose someone that you really love you do some crazy things 
 yo- 
 I don't know
 I like the idea that uh if someone is from a foreign country and they come to this country and uh commit a crime I think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported
 Especially if they're found guilty of the crime
 You know once they have been arrested 
 and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty
 That's it 
 we don't take care of them 
 we don't support them nothing 
 they go right back where they came from
 Exactly <> 
 and 
 But they're so close 
 I don't consider Mexican people in the same category with uh especially like uh people who come from cultures that don't have the same uh kind of moral upbringing that we have
 Like you take Asian countries or uh the Eastern countries where women are like uh in the background and the men are in the foreground 
 and it's like you know um they live back in where we came from two hundred years ago
 You know we've advanced beyond that 
 and I think that their uh mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing 
 you know what I mean
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Wow
 Wow
 You better believe it 
 if 
 you wouldn't even have to leave it 
 
 it would get snatched right off your arm 
 Oh sure
 That's amazing 
 well what's the difference there 
 do you know
 Oh I believe in the death penalty 
 I really do
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I think that we're too easy
 Uh and we take the uh civil liberties uh stuff too far
 You know like people that are in prison we didn't put them there 
 They put themselves in that situation
 And as far as like them uh entertaining the rights that they should have 
 we educate them 
 we feed them 
 we take care of them 
 and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again
 I'm not saying they're all bad 
 but I think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives
 I think that they should be put away
 Get rid of them
 Exactly 
 I think that that's the whole key here 
 This plea bargaining baloney where uh you know they plead to a lesser crime or uh they plead guilty or you know tell about someone else and they get less time 
 Or if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior for every year they're in they get so many less you know that they don't serve the full penalty
 I really think we're going to far overboard with all of this
 Yeah 
 same with drunk drivers
 I think it's too easy for them
 That if the laws and were were harsher and were enforced 
 you have to set an example 
 You have to start somewhere
 And I think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again
 an I feel bad for the policeman because he's out there every day facing these people this craziness you know people with uh automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job 
 and let's face it 
 what do they get paid
 Twenty thousand dollars a year if they're lucky 
 I wouldn't do it for that
 it really is 
 And they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything
 You know and I'm not saying that they're all good either because there's good and bad in everything
 but they're already uh have three strikes against them when they're out there
 Because they'll arrest someone and you know go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence 
 and you have to even be careful how you arrest them how you talk to them uh you know what they say
