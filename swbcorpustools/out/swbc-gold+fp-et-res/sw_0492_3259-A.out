 Okay 
 I'll just go with you first 
 What kind of eating out do you enjoy
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Do you go like home cooking like Black-Eyed Pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria
 Me too 
 Uh-huh
 Mexican 
 uh-huh
 Uh we do too 
 We do the same
 What are your favorite places
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 Well we've gone to August Moon 
 and we think that was real good
 but our favorite when you have a little more to spend is to go to Taiwan or May Dragon
 And those are excellent 
 They're really a nice place you could take someone to eat
 It's not the rinky Chinese decorations
 but it's a very elegant nice place to eat
 very often we go out for fajitas 
 That's 
 my husband has just gotten stuck
 And we go to On the Border And lots of places that have uh I think 
 and some of those and get fajitas 
 and he'll just eat chips until we've got three or four baskets coming back
 And then uh last weekend we went out for Italian also 
 and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to want to go eat lasagna and garlic bread 
 So we went to El Sorrento
 It was fun
 You know what 
 that's real funny you said that because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church 
 and Bob pointed to it 
 and he said "I keep hearing good things about that place 
 we're going to have to go"
 That's what he 
 tha- 
 in fact you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that
 So I guess we'll have to do it
 that's what 
 D MAGAZINE said that 
 It said there was always a line
 But that's a good sign 
 Yes 
 we did 
 Now my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti or lasagna 
 and most of those things were a little more northern Italy
 And they like just the traditional 
 They're not very 
 Yes 
 they are
 Exactly 
 Exactly
 The place of the seventies 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 most kids do
 W- 
 do you ever go for steak Just a steak and potato and salad bar that kind of thing
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well I'm real curious to try this one that has such commercials uh that Del Lincoln 
 and oh what is that guy's name 
 They do those real corny commercials
 there's one over there in Addison 
 I can't remember his name 
 Anyhow it's some 
 Yeah 
 it's some famous steak place over in Addison 
 there's a second one downtown 
 and they have these really corny radio commercials
 but they're steak is supposed to be wonderful 
 So I had not tried that 
 My husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie
 And it seems like I've been 
 we found those one time 
 and then they discontinued 
 It was over in Addison
 And then they uh closed up 
 So most of these places are pretty much just uh theme restaurants around here
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's exactly true 
 That's right
 That's right 
 Yeah 
 That's right
 That's e- 
 yeah 
 that's right
 Uh-huh
 I had a friend who was taken to Lawry's downtown for prime rib 
 and I haven't been 
 We usually don't go for beef really anymore
 Where 
 we've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that's usually the way we'll go if we're not going lasagna
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I know 
 Well I understand
 That's right 
 and save you some money too 
 Well 
 now what's your child's favorite place to eat
 Oh yeah 
 They're easy 
 Yeah 
 Well mine enjoy that too 
 They like to go pretty much where we like to go 
 and they'll 
 and then our favorite thing on Fridays we generally order pizza in 
 so not Pizza Inn but pizza to our house
 So we've done 
 Well um is there anything else you'd like to discuss about it
 I think it's come to an eye conclusion 
 so I'll talk with you later 
 Thank you
 Bye-bye
