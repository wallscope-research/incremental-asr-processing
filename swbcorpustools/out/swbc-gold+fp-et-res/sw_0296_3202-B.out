 Well a- 
 for 
 I grew up in the deep south like south Alabama 
 So whenever I think of family reunions 
 my family like got together almost every week
 And there would be like thirty people 
 So people talk about you know big family reunions 
 and I think like 
 I have a friend who just went to like Wyoming to some big ranch you know where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion 
 And I 
 so how I would go about doing it is I would just call all my relatives
 Because since I came from 
 my father has uh five sisters and two brothers 
 and my mother has four brothers and two sisters 
 So I ca- 
 both of my parents had big families 
 and we always got together just always 
 Now it's different because I live here 
 and I 
 you know when I go home I try to see the families as much of the family as I can 
 but it's real different 
 And I grew up in a real I think not normal setting
 Right 
 Sunday dinner was at my grandmother's 
 and you know like I said there would be you know thirty people 
 and everyone would just bring things 
 and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook 
 And i- 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I guess so 
 It really sounds like it was fun
