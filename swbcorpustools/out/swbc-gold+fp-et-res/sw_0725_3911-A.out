 Um
 I have an older son 
 yeah 
 He doesn't have any children yet though
 Uh he's thirty-seven 
 and I don't know if he's ever going to have any or not 
 but I do have some neighbor kids lots of little neighbor kids
 That 
 I go out and uh I play ball with them 
 You know it's because like this one that lives right next door her mother does some work at home on computers
 and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her Which is kind of sad you know
 So the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them 
 So I will go out and play catch with them or you know let the dogs outside 
 and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs 
 but uh actually I do think that the parents should have you know a little bit more time to spend with their kids
 No 
 when my son was at home I did work 
 and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat you know
 but we always had our days off together 
 and we went camping on vacations 
 So we had a lot of time together that way you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 Well I am sure it was you know 
 But uh I don't know what the families are going to come to now days because there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids 
 Because most of them the father and mother both work you know
 So it's really rough 
 Uh I have one neighbor uh the father is a fireman 
 and he works like four days on 
 and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days 
 but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family you know 
 So he's got a second job
 So you know he's not home very often
 And that's you know 
 the kids I know miss that
 You know 
 Yeah you know 
 and I don't know 
 I suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because you know he is out working trying to make some money for you know we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth you know
 But uh 
 Oh I am sure they would you know 
 So are you planning on having any children 
 or 
 Uh-huh 
 Um Yeah
 Well that's good
 That's what my uh daughter-in-law told me That they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage
 And they will be married nine years this year 
 So I don't know 
 She's a nurse you know 
 and uh she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids 
 so maybe they just decided that uh if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night
 You know 
 But uh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 so 
 Right
 Right 
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 uh do you plan on staying home after you have your children 
 or do you work or what
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
