 Okay 
 So uh with the issue of trial by jury uh I actually found the whole question about whether you need a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting
 I don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because I thought there were cases uh I don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve 
 Yeah
 Well I'd be curious as to what the uh requirement for an acquittal is 
 And I don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if you know six or seven voted not guilty then instead of it being a hung jury that was an acquittal 
 But I don't know whether you need a unanimous uh vote of not guilty to acquit
 Yeah 
 I'd agree with that 
 But I've never had the opportunity to serve on a jury although I've been out here and registered for I guess about five years
 But 
 Oh
 Well the people I know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that you know after initially finding out where people stand that the whole deliberation usually results if there is you know something like a nine three or more severe and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right
 and in fact I'm not sure that that's any more uh liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than anything else
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'd read one book I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things that uh went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases and in many cases looking at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right went back to the jurors uh based on the deliberations 
 Some of them did say that you know when they were the only one left opposing the verdict uh you know everyone was getting on them so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 once
