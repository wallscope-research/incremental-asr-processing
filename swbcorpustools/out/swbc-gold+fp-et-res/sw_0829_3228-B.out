 I think the last one that we actually went to go see 
 well there's two 
 I took my kids to see A HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS
 of course they wanted to see it 
 They had the Disney 
 book and they thought that was wonderful 
 and they loved the dogs 
 and so yes 
 we went with some friends of ours 
 and I was a little worried about my son 
 He's about two and a half
 and he's going through a stage right now where he's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can hear them and can't see them
 and he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are sending the message you know that the puppies are missing
 and it shows the town 
 and you can hear all the barking 
 but you can't see the dogs 
 Yeah 
 so that kind of bothered him
 but after that he did fine
 Yeah 
 he'll be three in January
 Yeah
 I loved that movie
 Probably gives them ideas of what they want to do 
 right 
 Yeah
 Wasn't that good
 Oh no
 Well I like to watch the movies 
 but it's gotten so expensive that we wait until they come out on video
 and we rent them
 and now we did go see HOME ALONE at the dollar movie 
 and that was just hilarious 
 I died
 And we did also 
 we went to see WHAT ABOUT BOB one night which is a funny funny movie
 it's a funny movie
 That's true
 I hope he stays cute not spoiled you know 
 you get to where the money goes to their heads or goes to something you know 
 they grow up too fast 
 But uh there's a lot I want to see you know 
 what I try to do when they come out is just make a list of them that look good so that when they come out in video 
 You know I'd like to see GREEN CARD 
 I want to see AWAKENING
 Uh I'd like to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 
 Yeah
 And see I've had somebody tell me that REGARDING HENRY you know the Harrison Ford movie is supposed to be really good 
 I'd like to see that
 I've heard that's good 
 yeah 
 So I think there's a bunch of good movies coming out 
 My kids want to see RESCUER'S DOWN UNDER
 so I'm going to ha- 
 my V C R went on the blitz about two weeks ago 
 so I'm getting it fixed right now because they have their their little you know Disney movies they watch all the time and stuff 
 and 
 Yeah
 You know I look at those 
 like CINDERELLA came out was for sale 
 and I don't buy them 
 now I will copy them and rent them and keep them at home
 but I just have a problem paying twenty five dollars for a movie that I can go down and rent for a dollar 
 You know they don't last that long
 Oh that's pretty good
 Yeah
 Yeah
 that makes it worth it uh 
 but a lot of the Disney movies it's just too expensive 
 and I can rent them
 or I can make a copy you know 
 my daughter's in love with the LITTLE MERMAID
 and I have a copy that's just about worn out
 She's four
 so she just thinks the grou- 
 in fact she told me Mom if we have a little girl and she has red hair we're naming her Aerial
 Now I'm not pregnant mind you 
 but this is 
 she's planning ahead 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh I know
 Now see I remember thinking it's a wonderful movie 
 but it's been so long since I watched it 
 I don't remember the language
 Was it bad 
 Well that's true
 Oh and see my kids weren't in the roo- 
 you're right 
 I watched it without them
 Huh
 Huh
 Yes
 Yes
 Yes 
 Some of it just isn't
