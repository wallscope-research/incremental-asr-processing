 Okay
 Well I left T I in January 
 but I signed up for this before I did
 Oh I think that's a good idea
 All right
 Oh no 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 Actually I um had basically set my sights to leave T I when they announced there would be no salary increases in ninety-one because [ I def- definitely ] need to make a little more money
 and uh I haven't really accomplished that yet 
 but I'm trying
 I wish I did 
 I hope you're a person who does things better than 
 I don't have a budget 
 That's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good oh long-range planning budget mode 
 Um I'm a single mom 
 and I've been just uh trying to get 
 Thank you 
 it's nice to have someone understand that
 how about yourself 
 do you have a budget you live by
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well that's great 
 How about your 
 Oh
 It really is 
 it really is 
 You know that was always a major problem in our marriage 
 What I have always identified is I am basically good with money 
 I don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it 
 I think that comes from never having enough 
 You know I'm always afraid I'm going to need some and where will it be
 So um no 
 I've finally worked myself into a spot where I can budget 
 when I was first divorced um I sat down and budgeted 
 and I had outgo that was much higher than what I had coming in
 I tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me 
 and so I lost the house Now that I've gotten past that I can sit down and say okay 
 this is the reality 
 This is how much money I have each month 
 The scary thing is as far as long term I don't have anything 
 I don't know if you have an I R A or uh you know 
 and I've got two girls also 
 and I haven't saved anything for their college 
 and 
 Sometimes I have
 Uh-huh
 Well I'll check that out
 Uh-huh
 You've learned a lot
 Well that's good to know how
 Uh-huh
 Well you must have done something 
 You're you're helping your children in school 
 and you're you know 
 Uh-huh
 Excuse me Jim 
 could you hold on 
 I have someone at the door
 I'll be right back
 <> <> Thank you 
 I think we might have just screwed up the computer 
 but we'll find out
 Oh
 and how did your daughter get scholarship money on
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 oh I'm definitely going to be actively looking into that
 Uh-huh
 Well that's great to know
 Yeah 
 that's good
 Oh well you're doing just fine 
 and uh actually when I talk I usually like to ask a lot of questions 
 I was wondering what you do at T I
 Oh goodness
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh absolutely
 Yeah
 Oh I hope you can do that
 what I did is 
 I was approached 
 [ and and ] I went to T I just right at the time that uh my marriage was ending 
 I had been a stay at home mom 
 and I was very fortunate in starting 
 and I really enjoyed it while I was at T I 
 but you know the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening 
 and I had less than five years 
 and also I wanted to make a little bit more money 
 So I decided I'd like to go out and try sales
 And uh I'm out trying to sell telephone systems to businesses
 And the potential there is fantastic
 The reality of it is it's tough 
 <> Exactly
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Yes
 They do
 I'm going to check that 
 I've got two friends that work at U T 
 I didn't know that all
 Definitely I will
 Uh-huh
 Well that sounds fantastic
