 I have not had the opportunity to go skiing 
 but uh I grew up in Arizona which has some mountains around it 
 but uh never did get out and ski 
 No 
 I never did
 uh I guess I didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing 
 and of course I was at that you know stage of my life where I had to be taken to places 
 I couldn't go by myself
 And then of course once I got to the age where I could have done it myself I had other interests I guess 
 So 
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I find if I make I have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me 
 Yeah 
 And my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer 
 so she's real excited about doing that
 We will be busy with that again
 Pardon me
 Well I did with my older daughter
 and she was in it for a few years 
 but she has got so many interests herself that we had to start eliminating 
 and well the first one to go 
 She still likes her piano
 and she is in band 
 So she's got lots of hobbies or uh activities going on
 Yeah
 Very much
