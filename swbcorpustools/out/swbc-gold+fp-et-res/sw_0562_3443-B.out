 Uh-huh 
 Oh well I'm at work 
 and I just happened to walk back into my office
 I've been gone for a little while 
 Uh-huh 
 I haven't ever made any 
 I just receive them 
 I haven't here lately
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Exactly
 Well I never gave it any thought myself 
 I was hoping you could tell me what you thought
 Uh-huh 
 Exactly 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 I don't know 
 I think maybe it should stay on a voluntary basis 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I think it would be good for uh everyone to do something like that 
 but I guess I don't feel like it should be something forced upon you
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Exactly 
 Really 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while 
 Wouldn't it though
 Uh-huh 
 it is
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 I know it
 Uh-huh

 Hang on a minute
 <> No 
 I don't think so 
 Yeah 
 Patty might 
 I'm back
 But how did you get on it
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Huh
 Uh-huh 
 I don't get too many 
 Huh
 The first time I used to get calls from far away too
 Like Maryland and New Jersey 
 but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I get calls from
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 Yeah 
 Oh I agree
 Oh shoot 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 No 
 I sure don't 
 No 
 no kids 
 Oh shoot 
 My sister is 
 I'd be more suited to that than her 
 she's just bugs
