 Well I don't 
 I haven't done any painting since I was a child 
 and my father would be painting and I'd ask him if I could you know take a turn or something 
 but uh 
 when we bought our home it was recently updated 
 They did that maybe improvements so they could sell it and things 
 so we didn't have to do any painting
 And the condominium we moved in before my husband went over and painted 
 but I 
 the experience that I've had is that um whatever time he said Oh it would take me just about four hours because it was only about like eleven or twelve hundred square feet over there 
 and he said Oh it's going to be just about four hours 
 Well he was gone the whole day 
 and he said Well all I got done was the taping around 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh I know
 it's just awful
 Pane
 Uh-huh
 Um
 No 
 and it really 
 like you said always takes way longer than anyone um is able to guess because I know my husband he painted when he 
 it was just the preparation time was so long That when he actually got down to the painting part it was like ten times longer than he already thought he would be done 
 and uh he did part of the at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in 
 um and he didn't notice until the next morning that he had finished one can off and started another one
 And then we went in there you know one was bu- 
 they were white 
 but one had more blue to it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Oh boy
 Well I don't recall my parents having that much trouble 
 you know they painted our rooms all the time 
 and we had a wooden 
 we hardly 
 we just had brick on like as accent on a certain area of our home growing up 
 and so he had to paint the outside all the time 
 and um I just don't think you know that there was that big problem 
 No
 but to us you know 
 we're going oh we're so glad we have a brick home all we have is like trim around the windows or something 
 and 
 uh no painting to have to do 
 <> I don't know that w- 
 like uh say we're freshly graduated from school and things
 so we haven't gotten to the point where we're hiring professionals to do too much of our needs
 We've been trying 
 you know we've done that the whole time we were in school Like trying to repair our own cars 
 and so I want to get to the point where I could feel like I could just hire someone 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's true
 No
 But still it's harmful 
 and they have to live with that every day in their clothes and everything
 The only painting job that was really painless for us was in this condominium that the um association that manages it they have to take care of like the structural damage 
 there was a roof leak 
 and that was not something that we had to pay for 
 So they sent their painters in to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then you know repaint the whole ceiling in a certain room
 But um they came in and did it and left in just no time at all 
 and I think it's because you know they were accustomed to working in that environment in those particular condominiums 
 and I didn't watch them 
 but I couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it the whole ceiling you know just within a couple of hours
 And uh 
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Well you too
 I guess it's getting to be lunch time 
 I need to go take care of the kids 
 but 
 You have a good day
 Bye
