 Start
 Um th- 
 well right now they've got a kind of a central location off of the main highway 
 and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper um plastic um I think three bins for glass white green and whatever other combination there is
 and I think they've got uh some kind of container for aluminum
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Um
 Uh-huh 
 Um
 Well that's good 
 Well Rowlett had sent out a survey not too long ago um in terms in how many people were interested in having a pick up I guess on the days they do trash or something like that 
 And apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably because they're going to do it 
 I don't know how soon they're going to do it or how organized it's going to be 
 but they're supposed to initiate that sometime in the next couple of months
 Um I've never noticed that 
 We don't have a whole lot because we're in a hospital setting 
 so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria Um
 Um no 
 there's only one pop machine 
 and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now 
 so uh mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea
 No 
 not really
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 That's good
 Yeah 
 I guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is
 And I think they're trying to make some changes 
 I noticed at the library or someplace this past uh month month and a half ago they were having a speaker um talk about doing lawn work and how important it is to cut your lawn without a bag Just to kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of all the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff 
 and it's uh I guess a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and let it work it's way back into the soil
 I saw part of that
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Um
 Yeah 
 well there are a lot of things that aren't 
 I'm 
 that's uh one of the things I wonder about 
 uh one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else 
 I wonder about some of the products that they don't take like some of the plastics and things that they don't take Uh why they couldn't do more recycling with those
 Um
 Yeah
 True 
 Yeah 
 I noticed that about things like 
 I seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and lawn additives and that type of thing 
 but the cost is like double or sometimes triple the regular fertilizers and things you buy 
 So in in terms of that 
 it's 
 you know and for the environment there's a good reason to do it 
 but the cost is kind of prohibitive
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's a good idea
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 true
 Um
 Yeah
 I'd heard something stranger 
 talk about bottles the other day on the radio station I think it's K L T Y They were talking about the 
 I think it's in Canada they're using oh recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs as a reinforcement for roads For road repairs 
 And apparently they don't break down very easily 
 and they don't expand or contract when the weather changes 
 and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well I think the more people are aware of it the more they'll do 
 I think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 True
 Uh-huh
