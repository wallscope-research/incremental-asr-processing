 Well I take it since you selected this topic that you have children
 You don't
 My goodness
 So Well I have two daughters 
 and um they've been latchkey children for a while 
 and they're almost where I can start saying they're you know young adults
 so I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore 
 Um we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask or expect
 Well if I were look- 
 Exactly 
 Exactly 
 Um I think my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children
 Uh-huh
 And I think that varies 
 I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child
 Um you know once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's you know really qualified per se 
 Um with a baby definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency
 So 
 Oh uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well I baby-sat a lot also when I grew up 
 and um coming from you know that background and the background as a parent now I think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a lot of times baby-sitters 
 I know I did this with my children 
 you get somebody where you kind of know the family already
 And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions
 because I had three younger brothers and sisters myself 
 so they thought okay 
 she knows how to treat children
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Wow
 Oh I agree with you 
 but there again you know she knew of your family
 and she met in a safe setting such as church
 So she was going on those two instincts 
 Just the same I know myself 
 I never 
 and I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children
 and it really shocked me 
 because just about six months ago someone came to my front door rang the doorbell 
 She had just moved in the neighborhood 
 She had her daughter with her 
 and the daughter was oh about a second grader 
 And she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit her child
 And I thought well she doesn't know me or my children from anything
 And I was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because I didn't know her then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house
 So people are so different
 Well I did have um my child uh in a day care for just a short time when my oldest was about two and a half
 and I worked just a part-time job 
 and uh in those situations um what I did is I went in 
 and you know I made a few phone calls 
 I went in and visited 
 I asked questions such as how they would discipline a child
 Um that was a concern with me 
 Um you know you learn a lot by going in there 
 and they explain to you you know what their day consists of and what their general rules are 
 and um you know that's as much as I know 
 You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers you know that have done this over and over again
 But I 
 go ahead
 Um I think I went by location for one thing
 I think most people do that 
 I think you start out with the criteria of you know do I know of anything 
 or do I know anyone who has their child in a day care 
 and 
 Right 
 Right 
 And then you know even at that you have to consider the logistics of it
 You know you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north even if that's the best one in the whole wide world 
 So there are just so many considerations
 Oh money is always a factor in my life definitely 
 you know I've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor Um even in something as important as day care 
 I know if I didn't have that stipulation I would have done things differently you know 
 Um Montessori school would be something that I would have pursued 
 but that's always a little bit more expensive than what I could look at
 Um and I was very very fortunate in that I didn't have to do that on a full-time basis
 and then you know when you get into the full-time basis day care
