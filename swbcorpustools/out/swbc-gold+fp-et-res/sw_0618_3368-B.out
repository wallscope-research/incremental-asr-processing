 Um huh Well I don't like it when uh people listen to my phone conversations like if they're outside my door while I'm talking in my room or when people like look through my things in my bedroom 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 Uh-huh
 Definitely
 Right 
 Right 
 Even uh we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting 
 and they would still come to our door and knock and 
 I guess not 
 no
 Yeah 
 Yes 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 mostly
 Yeah 
 Oh I don't know
 Well I am used to it now 
 but sometimes it sort of gets to me 
 but there is not much I can really do
 No
 Yeah
 Well I don't know 
 I always 
 Uh no 
 yes 
 I do 
 but they don't live at home
 Oh I used to do that though because I was the youngest 
 I would pick up the phone and listen to theirs 
 But I 
 Oh
 Yeah 
 But I stopped doing that a long time ago
 and they still do it to me
 Oh like s- 
 yeah 
 this lady does that to me at work when I'm taking an order or something 
 and she'll just sit there and listen like I'm doing something wrong 
 and she just started 
 and she is nice 
 but 
 <> Okay 
 But you know it gets annoying when they stand right over you watching everything you do
 But I- 
 No 
 Right 
 Well occasionally we'll have a person here or there but not as many as the phone calls you know 
 But 
 Uh
 Oh 
 Oh yeah 
 Especially when you're in a hurry 
 Um it can get busy 
 yeah 
 Usually in the week I'm 
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I've traveled quiet a bit 
 and I've been through Dallas Texas 
 It's pretty busy 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 Oh yeah 
 I suppose you do
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I am a real solid sleeper though 
 so that probably wouldn't bother me 
 I'd sleep right through it 
 Yeah 
 It takes a lot
 I had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time 
 I was mad because those were mine 
 No 
 It was a letter from a girlfriend of mine 
 I was upset because those were mine 
 and you know I thought he 
 Right 
 I thought he would respect me more than that to look through my things and not trust me 
 so that was upsetting 
 I was mad about that and my privacy there
