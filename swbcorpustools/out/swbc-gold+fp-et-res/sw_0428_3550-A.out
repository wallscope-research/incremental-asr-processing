 Okay
 Go ahead
 Yeah
 Oh well if you had all the money in the world or something 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 What do you have now
 Uh-huh
 Oh really 
 Yeah 
 well I have 
 my car is the first one we ever bought new too
 But we just bought another used car a couple weeks ago actually
 Uh mine is a Honda Accord
 Yeah 
 I do 
 and and um it's funny because after I bought it I was doing a lot of business traveling 
 and I 
 some of the cars that I got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors
 and um I don't like them as well except it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics 
 and mine is a standard
 and the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better
 it had a lot more pickup and everything
 Uh-huh
 Um
 usually AVIS
 AVIS
 Yeah
 It's just because we're on 
 I think of it 
 I'm not sure those are AVIS or not 
 but we have corporate contracts you know with the various companies
 so it depends on your destination too
 Kind of strange 
 Work for T I Uh-huh which is how I heard about this 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 It did huh
 Oh my gosh
 Oh that was great
 That's unusual to hear 
 usually you know something breaks 
 you look at the warranty 
 and it's excluded
 Oh I see 
 okay
 Oh you got your money's worth
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that is good
 Yeah 
 well I've been lucky 
 Mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it
 but I was real lucky because it just hit um the lens to the light
 It didn't actually dent the car or anything 
 So it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace that 
 and the store will pay for it anyway 
 so No big deal
 Um I probably wouldn't just because I already have one
 but you know if I had to make the choice again I'm perfectly happy with what I decided um although we did just buy another car 
 and that's a Legend
 um but it's a used one
 and um my husband has really wanted one for a long time 
 and the fact that you know this car that I have has performed so well 
 and before that I also had an Accord 
 it was a real old one
 and uh I bought that used 
 I had absolutely no money to my name and bought that 
 and it served me real well too
 So he's been impressed with all the Honda cars
 And 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 How did it go for you
 Hasn't left you stranded
 Yeah 
 I know
 Yeah
 Really
 Huh
 Well that's what my husband thinks about my car now that he's had the Legend
 it's windy
 I can't drive that 
 the Legend it's just so huge
 I don't like it 
 and it's so uh
