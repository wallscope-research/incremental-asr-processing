 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I think I agree with that very much
 I 
 do you 
 Do you think a lot of people when they are listening to a trial put themselves in a position like that and say I would never do something like that 
 and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done
 Uh-huh
 I never have either
 Is there a reason why you have never Uh-huh 
 My husband works as a police man 
 so I always assumed that that was why I was never called
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh do they have such a thing now as a six man jury
 Somebody told me the other day that there is what they call a six man jury 
 and I had never heard of such thing 
 and I wondered if it was true
 I never had either 
 but I just wondered Uh 
 another question was a criminal case should the jury be unanimous on their decision 
 and that I wasn't sure on either whether it should be unanimous or not
 That would mean they all would have to decide one way or the other
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Bring some of these things out
 Uh-huh
 Un apparently there are 
 I 
 since my husband worked as a policeman I can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that are not guilty of some part of whatever they're accused of
 I still have a little bit of a problem with that 
 Uh but I would suppose there are circumstances you're in the wrong place at the right time or know the wrong person at the right time
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 They still found him guilty
 When people said he was at work
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh for heaven's sake 
 So there's nine years of that man's life gone
 Uh-huh
 No 
 huh-uh
 Yeah 
 I guess that's where a lot of the problem lies 
 we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people the one's that are on trial
 And we often forget about the one the injustice has been done because I they still say our system is the best in the world
 Yeah 
 it's the best one that exists I guess
 Oh I think a lot of people are 
 I think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 That bad huh 
 I wouldn't like it 
 but I don't know if I'd go that far
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well I think pride in our country and our flag is so important 
 It's important in so many facets of our lives
 And uh I feel like if people don't like what our flag stands for they're welcome to go some place else
 There's nobody holding them here
 Right 
 They'd soon be back 
 I'm sure
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I don't know about the judge making the decision if that's 
 do you think that's good you know like if a jury 
 Uh-huh
 Make a recommendation
 Do they sometimes make a recommendation
 That's what I was thinking they sometimes do
 And they recommend 
 Yeah 
 And then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well I think that's where a lot of people think boy they're getting put away for a long time 
 but actually their chance course when 
 a lot of times when they come up for parole they're denied 
 It depends on you know what they'd been guilty of and a lot of different things I guess
 Uh-huh 
 A lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do 
 And there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I always thought there was wrong 
 it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody
 It seemed like sometimes there's not a good 
 the balance isn't right 
 It doesn't make sense
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 right 
 So let's put up with it I guess
 Improve it if we can if we ever get a chance
 So 
 Well it's been nice talking to you Jack 
 and I hope you have a real good day and week
 I hope not
 You too
 Bye-bye
