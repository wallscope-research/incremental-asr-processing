 <> What do you think about the benefits in jobs
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and a lot of times they turn down your claims 
 so that leaves you paying for all of it
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 the health insurance I have is Met Life 
 and if 
 it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then uh you just pay ten dollars 
 and then uh the insurance pays the rest of the bill 
 Or if you go outside you get uh seventy thirty
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 and they're probably doing it to their benefit anyway 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Well I work for Sears 
 and um that's about the only real benefit you have is health insurance
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 but everybody gets vacation 
 like uh T I and some other places you know they have recreational facilities 
 and they have a driving range and weight room 
 and you know I think they even have a swimming pool
 and I don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 Well I don't know the working conditions you know if you could include that in benefits 
 Some places aren't very safe to work
 and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you have to work under
 Right 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think so
 Uh-huh 
 <> Um workmen's comp is a big thing now in Texas because um um how much it costs the employers
 and a lot of them are going to their own insurance now 
 And it reduces some of the length of the benefits uh and I don't know besides that 
 But I noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing
 Well well they still have to pay it 
 but they buy their own instead of going through the state
 So apparently it costs less that way
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 That's what I think 
 they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are 
 and how much profit they're making 
 instead of trying to cut everything down 
 *[[listen]] and then have everybody be unhappy and have a constant turnover of people
 Yeah 
 the productivity and the training costs 
 if they have to train a new employee every six months then I don't see how they can save money
 You know and once they once they get somebody good they ought to hang onto them
 Okay 
 it was nice talking to you
 Yeah 
 Bye-bye
