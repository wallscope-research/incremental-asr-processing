 I think you got it
 Uh-huh
 Well it sounds like you have really strong views on it
 And I can see that point 
 but I also have this you know 
 I question 
 I guess I can look at it both ways 
 And just to play devil's advocate it never seems right to me that uh we take in people that are criminals and people that are you know low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families
 our taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people
 And it just 
 that I find very difficult to swallow sometimes 
 Uh-huh
 I'm with you there
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Ha- 
 Right 
 Exactly
 And then when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs you know we could be poor people and you know helping the environment 
 prison is such a waste of a human being
 It doesn't do anyone any good
 Yes 
 people need to be punished
 and I do agree with your statement that to take a human life is wrong
 Um but you know 
 but locking someone up and not getting you know any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh exactly w- 
 That's right
 That's right
 Uh-huh 
 We want a safe environment for ourselves 
 And we want to remove them
 but I think that the whole crux of the problem is no one has come up with a solution that is acceptable that does you know basically you know 
 I think you know that the whole idea of uh the death penalty was invented for two reasons 
 It removes them from society
 and number two [ it's the ultimate punishment Because you know they've harmed someone 
 and you know you want to appease the people that have suffered
 But it really doesn't take their pain away
 Uh-huh 
 But it's a 
 Right
 Exactly 
 But that 
 the problem is so incredibly complex 
 I have a friend who works on the pardon and paroles 
 and she interviews inmates all the time that are coming up for parole
 And she says it is just really frightening how easy it is to you know have the prisons release people because they're overcrowded
 And these people have not benefited from the stay there 
 She says just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong
 and there's not anything she can do to keep them in You know if they meet certain guidelines you know 
 and those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work 
 So it's 
 Uh-huh 
 That's right
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 I know 
 I know 
 I would like to see the money that's been budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of alternate solutions to the problem
 How are we going to fix that Tanya 
 How are we going to make that happen
 What power do we have
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Really 
 I know 
 I know
 But it sounds like you are uh you know interested in what's going on around you
 And uh you know when you have a voice you do contribute 
 and I guess that's you know what we're meant to do
 Maybe an opportunity will come by that we will have a chance to make a real change
 Where do you work
 Oh you do
 That's great
 Uh-huh
 Exactly 
 Uh-huh 
 Most of us are so sheltered you know
 And a few people in the news that bring it to us and make us see what's out there
 Well that's 
 you're really performing a benefit to society in doing that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I'm just agreeing with you When I think of it how difficult it must be to just to just give the facts Because usually on an issue that you really care about uh you want to you know persuade people to your viewpoint
 And you're right 
 that has got to be a challenge sometimes
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 And you have to walk right down the middle with it
 Yeah
 I'm sure 
 Well that sounds interesting
 And I'll read your book sometime
 I enjoyed it
 Thanks for calling
