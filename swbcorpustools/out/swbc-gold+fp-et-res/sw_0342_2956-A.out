 Well uh I have probably had more time than you have to think about this subject 
 so I'll tell you is it a serious problem 
 Yes 
 I do believe it's a serious problem
 However there are solutions to it
 And foremost uh where we compare that we are now doing fifty percent of our uh people are voting 
 Uh we're probably making a comparison against uh some European uh and uh uh s-s-say newer republics uh that have very high percentages
 Uh so uh uh one of the reasons that it is lower in the United States is that mostly we hold it on Tuesdays 
 God knows why we hold it on Tuesdays 
 And then we further complicate it by saying you know we will keep the polls open until eight o'clock
 uh a great number of people now work at different jobs that if a third of the people are shift workers they won't be able to get to the polls in any case If they uh have to work late into the evening and not get up 
 My solution to that is that we hold it on Sundays As do probably sixty to seventy percent of the European countries now
 they hold it on either a Saturday or a Sunday or at least a day when uh a great number of people are not working
 I- 
 in America that is not true because a great number of people work on Sundays
 but that is one of my solutions Uh 
 Have you absentee voted in Texas
 Well I have absentee voted in uh New Hampshire 
 and it is a fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot 
 I do not say that it is that complicated 
 but part of the process also is that you must preregister at some particular point 
 New Hampshire is fairly easy 
 but other states you have to register every couple of years uh Well to just vote 
 So registrations are perhaps a problem also 
 And we're the mobile society uh
 People are always mo- you know 
 one out of every seven people moves every year 
 Uh that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every you know 
 if you compound that uh eh- eh 
 if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote <>
 Well 
 Well maybe that is another factor the motivational factor 
 The motivational factor is probably 
 I 
 Well that's diminished by 
 w-we have noticed this in particular 
 I just read two books 
 one of them is WHOSE STARS AND STRIPES NOW
 THE uh TRIVIAL PURSUIT OF THE PRESIDENCY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY-EIGHT
 It's a fairly decent book 
 uh it's preceded by uh several other books by these guys 
 Uh WAKE ME UP WHEN IT'S OVER was about the eighty-four elections 
 And I forget what the other books were 
 but any case uh i-i-it is uh uh the mar- 
 uh uh there was uh 
 BLUE SMOKE AND MIRRORS was the one in eighty-two 
 Uh these guys uh have taken the place of Theodore White on reporting elections 
 In any case they say that uh there's a definite trend uh well you know toward candidates using negative voting 
 It is the only way that you can use television effectively
 No 
 the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy than a positive factor 
 and you know 
 if you go on the attack and put some sensational thing before the public as Mike Dukakis learned in the last campaign 
 and it is not refuted 
 people will you know uh believe it 
 If you don't refute it as he didn't there must be some truth to the matter see 
 <> Well he didn't refute it til the last two weeks of the campaign 
 He didn't believe anybody would believe that 
 And indeed his trend started upward 
 Well they do 
 Well don't give too much credit to the American public for their motivational ability 
 and it 
 Well it uh 
 well I don't know 
 Is it working 
 that's the question 
 I guess the question also that we discovered is that they don't throw rascals out 
 Everybody seems disappointed 
 but they don't throw the rascal out their own rascal
 Uh my solution to part of this is to make it an economic incentive for people to vote 
 That sounds rather crass I think because then you are saying well uh y-y-you know it could be convoluted in many ways where people would actually uh by paying them 
 you know you would take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever
 But it would be very difficult to administer because I am sure that any time money and votes are involved 
 the whole thing just stinks
 Yeah 
 but the idea is to get the individual to the polls a-a-and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls 
 Oh you mean the special interest groups 
 Well read my lips and no new taxes 
 and yet Bush did that 
 but he's excused from that 
 Generally people I've read polls now where they've excused him because there was a definite necessity to balance the budget
 Oh he gave it 
 he promised the best he could 
 And he is the president 
 and he should address those problems 
 and if there needs to be a change in a period of time 
 what was so funny about it is that I guess that it happened so rapidly you know 
 He knew it 
 He actually knew it 
 And being associated with government he should be held up to the light for that 
 And maybe he will
 But I think it is er-r-r 
 I think you still have a view that the American voter is different from other voters 
 And he is motivated because we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that 
 I think voters are motivated uh 
 Well I don't know if they have higher turnouts overall 
 I don't think England has 
 I think England has about a seventy percent sixty-five percent turn out
 I think that we just discovered in the Indian elections is one of the greatest and massive things in the world 
 Uh just it got more violent every year 
 They went down almost fifty percent in this election before they blew up Ghandi But simply because people were so concerned about their inability that their vote does not count any way And the corruption of politics in that s-s-situation there 
 but you know everything is relative to when uh eh you know we had higher turnouts because at that time we talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter right
 is 
 but before this Voting Rights Act what we had was a great deal of our population uh mainly the blacks in the south and the Hispanics were precluded by uh voting laws uh from their eligibility to register 
 Now everybody is available
 So if you really computed it they probably 
 when we said we had a seventy percent turnout in nineteen fifty we really only had a fifty percent turnout 
 because all the eligible voters 
 you know it was skewed by the eligible voters being less than the total population of 
 No 
 I think there's a higher percentage in certain black areas of voters 
 I don't know about Hispanics you know 
 I haven't studied the statistics well enough to 
 I think in this sort of conversation we can only do our own reaction
 Uh-huh
 What do you mean
 You know Karen I wonder if we are recording
 I did press one 
 but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up
