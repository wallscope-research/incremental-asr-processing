 Okay

 Hm 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Oh that's a good idea
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's good
 Um I know 
 we are kind of getting into recycling now 
 I'm in college 
 and I live in a dorm 
 and we recycle paper
 And I know that there's a glass plant up here 
 and they recycle glass 
 and you know we recycle old aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 And then when our dorm 
 whenever our bins are all filled up we take them and turn them in 
 and then we get money for that
 Yeah 
 you know we just keep it with the dorm
 Well we buy things for the dorm whatever the dorm needs you know 
 Like we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things 
 and then we buy like cooking equipment and stuff
 Or we play games like board games 
 We buy board games 
 You know it's just different things whatever you know 
 we vote on it 
 and whatever the dorm would want that's what we buy
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 No
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Oh that'd be go- 
 Is that what this target is 
 what you're 
 No
 Huh-uh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 I would like 
 let's start up a Target 
 No 
 Um I don't really know any other recycling that they do
 No
 No 
 huh-uh 
 We have to take it to a recycling place
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Oh I didn't know that
 Um I never heard of that <>
 Um not that I know of 
 No
 Oh my gosh
 Um
 Yeah 
 uh we have places where we go 
 and what we do is we unload our cans 
 It's like a conveyor belt 
 and the belt separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because it has a magnet on it 
 And then they weigh uh your aluminum cans 
 and then you get money for your aluminum cans
 No 
 But now they're going to start giving us money for the other ones too 
 Before they didn't 
 But I know they're going <> to start now
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Well that's all I really know about recycling
 Oh really
 We have Kroger but not a Skaggs

 You guys are getting into it more than we are
 Uh-huh 
 Huh-uh 
 I've never seen any you know places that do 
 I know um we reuse our grocery bags now 
 We take them back you know and use the ones that we have 
 You can like 
 if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 but we don't have any place that collects the grocery bags
 Uh-huh
