 Okay 
 what do you think are some current trends in uh the way families spend time together based on what you've seen
 Yeah <>
 Really
 Are you newly married 
 or 
 Yeah 
 same situation here I've been married about ten months 
 so Yeah 
 I know what you mean
 Yeah
 Is he a hunter and a fisher and all that
 that's wild 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Um from the people I've talked to I don't know if I should bring this into it 
 but um a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers um where they could manage their own schedule 
 and uh they could spend more time with their kids 
 because they look back 
 and you know they're all like um kind of regretful I think
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 same here
 Yeah
 At T I is that where you work
 It's really kind of sad 
 some of the people that I work with like when I worked on second shift um their kids go to school during the day 
 and then they wouldn't see them at night because they would be you know at work and the kids are all ready in bed 
 And so it was kind of like they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses 
 This relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends or something you know
 So it was really sad you know that a lot of families um well you know have to have dual income 
 A lot of people choose to which is fine
 But uh you know then the kids kind of suffer
 Uh-huh huh <>
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh
 I know 
 Unfortunately that's probably true 
 Um do you think the parents spend quality time with their kids 
 do you think it's more like watching T V and stuff like that not really uh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 <> it's always that way until it's too late
 Yeah 
 it's true um 
 what are some other questions they have 
 I'm not sure 
 I know my parents are growing up 
 I guess they never spent much time watching T V 
 In fact I've never seen my mom turn on the T V 
 we didn't really have one 
 Yeah 
 and they spent a lot of time like outside with us and stuff 
 but you know my dad had his own business 
 and it was easier for them to do that 
 but I don't know 
 I guess I didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's a good way to put it
 Yeah 
 that's a pretty good way to put it 
 well if you had kids what kind of things do you hope to do <>
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Do volunteer work and be in clubs and stuff 
 yeah 
 I agree 
 I hope that happens in my case
 Yeah
 Yeah Huh 
 I know
 Yeah 
 and what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids That may not necessarily be consistent with yours
 Yeah 
 Huh well I don't even think we had 
 I don't even remember them being around when we were little
 Yeah
 Sure is um 
 well <> I guess we could ring this off since we've exhausted all of our ideas 
 we seem to agree 
 Yeah 
 so 
 Yeah 
 you too 
 I wish you the best
 Okay 
 thanks
 Bye-bye
