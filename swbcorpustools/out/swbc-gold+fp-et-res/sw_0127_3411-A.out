 What kind of car would you like to buy next
 Well why would that be
 Okay 
 well that's good
 If you had uh no financial requirements if you could buy any car in the entire world no matter what it cost what would you buy
 Do you
 Which type of Cadillac uh is your favorite
 The Seville
 That's a sharp looking car
 That really is 
 it always has been though You know 
 it doesn't have the Coup de Ville or the Sedan de Ville squareness 
 It never really has 
 It's always had it's own unique look
 Well I've always liked that 
 I liked the 
 a couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it
 I thought now that looks sharp
 that looks real sharp
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and uh the 
 uh I've never ridden in one recently um 
 but they're supposed to be just real smooth
 Just a nice comfortable ride
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Now they've got a unique uh feature in them now 
 uh if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't go you know into the inside 
 It'll go underneath the car instead
 So that's a big safety factor they've got in them now
 The air bags 
 yeah
 So 
 well that's great 
 that's great
 So you say you've always have preferred General Motors products 
 Right
 What kind of uh General Motors cars have you had in the past
 Oldsmobiles 
 Those are real nice riding cars too
 Has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra
 The Ninety-Eight 
 okay
 Well I don't think 
 uh let's see 
 the Ninety-Eight 
 now that's got that big V eight engine in it doesn't it 
 Has a little V Six
 Okay
 It 
 Oh that's great
 that's great 
 That's always nice to get uh reliability in a product Especially when you're spending you know anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars for a single item You know 
 you just don't want any hassles with it 
 you expect it to do its job 
 and I think a lot of car manufacturers don't take that into consideration you know
 They just expect you to buy their product 
 but that's been a key factor in me is how reliable is this car going to be you know 
 Price is an issue 
 but it's not the most important issue
 Right
 Well I've always been a Ford man myself
 Yes
 But that's all right
 You know it's American made too which is good
 Um but I've 
 ever since I guess I was growing up my dad's always had Fords 
 and uh well I grew up in South Dakota 
 So everybody has a truck
 and my Ford trucks have just 
 I've just never had problems with them
 I honestly think I would die before my truck would keel over on me
 So
