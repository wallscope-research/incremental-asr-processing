 Hi
 I'm Tina
 I live in Garland Texas
 Oh my lands you're the farthest person I've ever talked to
 Yeah
 My husband does
 Yeah 
 Probably most people you talk to do huh
 Huh
 I see 
 well that's neat
 Yeah 
 I guess you have to push one though
 Okay
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I guess so 
 it may be interesting because probably here in Texas we may eat a little differently than you do up there 
 Oh really
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Well uh the thing that I found interesting 
 my husband and I lived up in Washington State for awhile
 and up there of course they ate a lot of sea food and that kind of thing 
 and down here sea food is pretty expensive because you have to ship it a long way to get it 
 Right 
 but here we eat a lot of like Mexican foods
 and um up there there was no place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me
 Yeah 
 it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could 
 but it just didn't taste right
 Yeah
 and uh down here we eat a lot more fried foods I think
 Like chicken fried steak is a real big thing
 Up there uh it was hardly ever heard of 
 and we drink ice tea with every meal
 and up there hardly anyone drank ice tea 
 Really
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 it never gets real cold
 Yeah 
 but when we have a dinner party around here I think a lot of the time a Mexican menu is something real popular
 Yeah 
 I know that um I do a lot of planning with our church
 and a lot of the times when we get together well everybody will bring a Mexican dish 
 And Italian food is real big too
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 How about you 
 what is real popular up there
 Oh really
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's good
 Uh-huh 
 right
 Oh yes 
 I love that kind of cooking 
 uh unfortunately I am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things 
 Right 
 They
 Uh-huh
 That probably makes it easier 
 but 
 Yeah 
 We find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese 
 uh and of course 
 Right
 Yeah 
 well that's pretty much what we do 
 if dad's not coming home we have macaroni and cheese or something 
 But they like uh spaghetti
 You know that's one meal I can fix 
 and the whole family eats 
 But uh there are several things that 
 well as a matter of fact I keep chicken nuggets handy all the time because 
 Yeah 
 the children love them
 and uh they are real easy to cook 
 and that way whatever meat we have if they don't like it well 
 and my girls don't like beef 
 I don't know
 I guess
 Well yeah 
 it could be they don't 
 I think it's the texture of it
 but it takes more chewing 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Right 
 So they're not too much into beef
 My husband and I eat more beef than we should 
 but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well most of the entertaining we do is church associated
 We have a real tiny little house 
 we don't have room really to have people here
 But we do get together for fellowships at our church
 and my husband and I do a lot of the planning in that
 And 
 Yeah 
 it is 
 and it's fun to uh 
 I like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 That's right 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever you uh like best
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I remember one time we had a progressive dinner
 It's the only time that ever 
 Yeah 
 they are
 But it's the only time I can remember that 
 I can't remember what food it was 
 it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with 
 Several people were supposed to bring you know each like uh an appetizer and a main dish and a dessert 
 And we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers 
 but when we came to the main dish plate there was only like two or three 
 Well not really 
 you know we all took real tiny little portions and uh were kind of angry with whoever it was 
 we were not sure who didn't show up with the food 
 Yes
 Right
 Right 
 either go ahead and fix your dish 
 or call someone that can
 I know it 
 Well that sounds neat 
 I can't uh believe you're so far away 
 but you sound so close
 It sounds like you're here in Dallas
 Oh
 I don't know if I have anything handy 
 we were getting ready to go swimming
 and we're waiting on my sister
 Cara hold on just a second <> 
 As a matter of fact my little one is hollering 
 I think it probably has been
 So I've enjoyed talking to you
 Thank you 
 Thanks for calling
 Bye-bye
