 Well I alternate between Danielle Steele is one of my very favorites 
 uh then I try to go into one of the self improvement books 
 Uh we take books every once in a while in our Sunday school class and go through them 
 Uh I love Scott Peck and his ROAD LESS TRAVELED
 Oh it is wonderful 
 I thoroughly enjoyed that 
 What do you read
 Okay
 Oh yes
 I try to keep a book going all the time 
 Uh I try to read when I first wake up in the morning and then before I go to sleep 
 So I probably get oh thirty to fifty pages a day read
 And I just you know 
 I don't feel like 
 in fact this morning I was almost late for work because I'm almost at the end of this book 
 and I didn't want to put it down 
 But I like mysteries
 Uh yes 
 I like uh uh {F oh 
 } I'm drawing a blank 
 Uh he wrote the uh BOURNE ULTIMATUM
 Ludwig yes
 And uh I like Jeffrey Archer
 He is an English author who writes some mystery 
 Uh well I guess they're a type of mystery 
 They're usually some p- 
 he's a ex-lawyer 
 or he's a lawyer who no longer practices 
 but his have some part of the law uh enveloped in them
 Right 
 and then uh the new author that came out with uh oh the one that uh Harrison Ford starred in
 No 
 no 
 it was the uh 
 it's late 
 I'm tired 
 so I'm not thinking too well
 Uh-huh
 Oh uh it was his first book 
 it was on the top of the list uh 
 he was a D A
 Yes
 Okay 
 and then he came out with the second one 
 Uh a sequel to it
 And both of those I've enjoyed real well 
 But I like that 
 I love Danielle Steele 
 and you know if I want to get a fantasy and get away from it all
 No 
 no 
 she isn't at all
 Her books uh 
 you always cry
 it's always good for good tears
 Uh one book that she wrote that's good for both men and women is FINE THINGS 
 F I N E THINGS Well it's one that's you know 
 it's always going to make you have a good cry 
 and you know it's going it turn out good 
 and you're going to be happy in the end 
 And I said you know 
 I don't want anything too real anymore 
 I have enough of that in my own life 
 I want happy fantasy 
 like 
 Uh-huh
 Uh I do my share of it 
 I certainly can't say that I understand a lot of it
