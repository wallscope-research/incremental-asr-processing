 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 uh like you I haven't done any in quite some time except for what I call living now which is very close to camping 
 Yeah 
 You know I uh camped in the Boy Scouts 
 and you know my dad and I went out sometimes 
 but uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working I camped almost all of the time because I was in construction
 And it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress 
 when you have to have it you have got to have it
 And you know in those those kinds of situations uh room rent which is outrageous 
 So my buddy and I we just camped 
 And we figured what the hell 
 we did it when we were kids 
 and we loved it
 Of course we didn't really rough it that much 
 when I was in high school 
 he is a couple years older than me 
 and uh he graduated and went off to college 
 and uh during the summer we would camp out at the lake 
 But it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove 
 You know I had a little boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine
 And uh well it was fantastic 
 We would get up in the morning go skiing uh 
 that substituted for a shower 
 and then we would go to work and uh come back to the uh you know boat house at night 
 and uh in the afternoon you know it is still four o'clock 
 You have got four hours of day light good skiing left
 And uh it was great
 But uh you know now all my life is more like camping than not camping really
 Oh yeah 
 Well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago
 We didn't have a phone
 They didn't have phone lines 
 You just couldn't get phones
 And uh we are third from the end on the electric string
 So we are at the end of the mail route 
 Like I said we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas
 But uh you know right now uh what we did my wife and I is we got a mobile home One of these twelve by forty-eight's that got repoed And uh swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring I would build a house some day you know 
 I'm in construction 
 and uh you know I just had this place you know to shower up while I was you know out here you know putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in you know
 And uh I came home from work one Friday afternoon 
 and our truck was back 
 Everything we had was in boxes 
 and my wife said uh we're moving
 And I said where 
 And she said out to the trailer 
 And I said oh 
 She said yep 
 and I said okay 
 So we have been roughing it out here for about three years 
 but it is not bad 
 we have color T V microwave you know 
 it is not horrible 
 but it's a lot like camping
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Became civilized
 Yeah 
 my mom goes camping you know 
 She takes her uh motor home 
 You know she's got one of these huge Winnebago's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning color T V microwave oven you know 
 She just 
 roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower You know
 But you know she has a lot of fun
 And mostly it is just a way to 
 she goes to dog shows
 See she shows dogs 
 and uh you can sneak a dog into a motel
 but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel
 So she uh you know takes the motor home 
 And she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing
 And she 
 if he would buy her a motor home 
 So he did 
 But as far as camping my wife and I have plans to uh not really camp per se but to drive up the uh you know Highway One there in California uh as soon as we get this house finished
 I am going to need a vacation
