 Well uh the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time are crafts 
 and uh I've been involved in making uh hat stands and uh rag dolls and uh different type hats with uh flowers and roses you know and uh that kind of thing straw hats and all that kind of stuff 
 And I enjoy it 
 it's relaxing 
 And you kind of get absorbed in it 
 so the time goes by you know before you realize anything is going on 
 And I play the organ sometimes uh just for my own satisfaction Not for anybody else's ears 
 because I'm not that good at it 
 but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while
 How about yourself
 Really
 Oh yeah 
 that's neat

 we put a kitchen in and um that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering 
 that's fun
 It is 
 It really is
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 I like things that you know two people can do 
 but I like the quiet of doing things away you know 
 kind of gives you some space for yourself 
 and that's what I find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that I can create 
 and I like to crochet and knit 
 I made some afghans and that kind of stuff 
 I like doing things with my hands
 Yeah

 and we used to go to Joe Allen's Barbecue

 I miss it 
 Oh yeah
 I did horseback riding too 
 in fact when my children were growing up we always had horses 
 and uh that was kind of for them 
 but they weren't as interested in it as we were you know 
 so uh that was a real 
 I'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that you know 
 we always had horses around 
 and I really enjoyed that
 and I was disappointed when I went to Texas 
 I didn't see that many of them
 Yes
