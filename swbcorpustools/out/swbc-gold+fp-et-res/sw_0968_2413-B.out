 Well the one I think is interesting is the Los Angeles police chief who says he won't resign 
 And did you hear yesterday that Mayor Bradley said that uh he should
 I think what's interesting is that uh the political activists Jesse Jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating 
 I find it interesting that uh outsiders would bother to go in 
 how do you feel about people like Jesse Jackson getting involved
 Well but do you think Gates should resign
 well speaking of that kind of issue have you kept up with John Wiley Price
 What do you think of him
 He's an interesting person 
 I was talking to someone who said that uh for all his obvious efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the uh 
 I guess he's on the County uh oh Board of Supervisors or 
 and uh at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker and is really quite agreeable uh 
 and that this stuff we see you know in the media is uh 
 well he's really just trying to make a political statement 
 I find that an interesting element of politics that most people would not know that John Wiley Price apparently is a you know 
 of course he's got in this deal of racism and the you know name calling and all this 
 But apparently he's a a worker 
 Uh you may disagree with him 
 but I find this whole 
 what do you think of this uh fourteen one and ten four one in Dallas
 I agree with you 
 but did you see the map they drew up uh on how they were going to divide up the districts
 it was the strangest 
 I'm not sure it was gerrymandered 
 but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff I guess I'm a little cynical of the power base 
 and I don't quite understand uh why they don't go with fourteen one 
 it seems to me that what happened in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly uh I think it's Hispanics don't vote because they don't think that they have any affect 
 and it's 
 I guess I am disappointed with Dallas in that uh the fourteen one it 
 I don't know 
 you can disagree with Al Lipscomb and uh 
 what's the lady's name
 Yeah 
 You can disagree with uh what they're doing and what they're saying 
 but in reality I think they're trying to represent their constituents
 and I think Dallas is doing itself a disservice 
 I think they ought to get on with something important
 Yeah 
 but even those people are 
 it's like Pauken and Box and these people 
 I think it's kind of interesting that everybody's so busy politicking that the question is are we getting anything good done 
 It's like this whole school issue 
 Are you involved in the schools at all public schools This whole thing down there where they're trying to um uh you know devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools 
 and it all seems you know like everybody's trying to one-upmanship on everybody else 
 so 
 I have got to run to a meeting
 It was good talking to you 
 I don't think we've gone our ten minutes 
 but I think we've talked long enough
 Okay 
 Good night
