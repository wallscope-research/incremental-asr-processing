 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 So do you have a car
 Do you have a car
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 We used to have a Honda Accord 
 and they're good 
 They're really good cars 
 Every time I get taken to an auto repair place you know every time I go I get taken 
 Bad you know 
 Woman goes in 
 and they go all right we got a sucker 
 Let's see how much money we can get out of her you know 
 That's what happens every time
 Uh so 
 I have a Pontiac Six Thousand
 Yeah 
 But our Honda just got old and just wore out 
 It was let's see eleven years old 
 and it just out of it 
 so No 
 huh-uh 
 My uh ex-husband's 
 this just happened a couple of weeks ago 
 He's my ex-husband 
 but just a few months ago when he was my husband uh his father gave us this car 
 and everything is wrong with it 
 the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks you know 
 Uh eighty-seven
 And he just doesn't take care of things 
 but I was awarded the car 
 so There is a man in my church that is a mechanic 
 and I can trust him 
 So he is trying to get you know things fixed on it
 But it's just you know leak leak leak everywhere 
 But uh you know I hate to go into a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not you know and charge me twice as much 
 The last time I took it into a repair shop 
 the man told me I needed a master cylinder 
 So I said okay 
 And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars 
 and then uh about a month later a man was looking at my car 
 and he asked me 
 you know not a repair man but just a friend 
 and I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on 
 and he looked at 
 and he said that's not a new master cylinder
 and I didn't even know what one was 
 And uh he showed it to me 
 and it was old rusty just awful 
 It was no more new than nothing
 Uh more than likely
 That was it probably 
 It was ve- 
 I was so irritated 
 And that's happened to me more than once or twice just about every time I've went in somewhere
 and you can hardly find one you know 
 The guy that's doing most of my car now uh goes to my church 
 and that's the only reason you know I go to him because I know him 
 and I know he will tell me the truth 
 Because he doesn't even charge me for doing it 
 so he's not going <> to you know take me
 I just pay for the parts 
 and he does it so
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I am 
 so I don't know 
 I don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car they're usually the worst one of all 
 We took our Honda to the Honda dealership 
 and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car
 Yeah 
 And so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars 
 you know they told us we just had to have one 
 and we bought one 
 We didn't no more need no new engine 
 give me break you know
 So it was not good 
 and uh
