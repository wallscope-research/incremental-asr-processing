 Well uh I watch the uh national news every day for one 
 I also read one or two papers a day 
 and I'm pretty much a news junkie 
 and I tune in to C N N a lot
 Uh every evening at six thirty I believe 
 I watch the national news
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 as opposed to paying for cable
 Yeah
 Uh overall I 
 the quality of the news you get off of most uh sources I would say is pretty low 
 It's 
 usually you get pretty incomplete coverage 
 and that's one of the reasons why I try and get as many sources as possible 
 because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on You would hope 
 but still you know hard to say that what you've heard is what really is
 Well I read uh the local newspaper 
 and I also try and read one of the uh major dailies like the CHICAGO TRIBUNE or the NEW YORK TIMES or something like that
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Pretty low
 Right 
 I really like N P R a lot
 Right 
 yeah 
 I N P R a lot also 
 I really like them because they give uh 
 instead of being as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which I think is good
 And they also 
 their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than say your major network news and that kind of thing
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah
 Sure was
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that was 
 but then you also have things uh where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which I thought was really good
 Uh-uh
 Right
 Well but the news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something that's good also about C Span which I tune into every once in a while
 Yeah 
 it is really kind of boring 
 but you know that's 
 if you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned uh report somebody else's view about it 
 and that's what you're supposed to 
 if you watch the news your opinion is going to be formed on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion which I would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's
