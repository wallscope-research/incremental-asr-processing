 Okay
 Well Rome is pretty small 
 But uh 
 we hear a lot about uh New York City
 There is a lot of crime down there 
 And I am afraid to go down there because you know you hear about people getting mugged 
 You leave your car for ten minutes 
 and it is stripped when you come back
 No 
 I have not 
 Only to the airport
 No 
 I work for the Air Force
 So there is a base up here 
 And 
 Bases are pretty safe because they check your I D on your way in 
 And 
 Right 
 But even so we had a uh uh 
 at New Years we had some people come in and uh like attack one of the planes Because they were protesting uh the presence over in the Persian Gulf
 So 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That makes it bad for getting out during a fire
 I do not know 
 it seems to 
 I think it is getting worse Because I keep hearing things 
 like when I went home 
 my parents live in Boston
 But I went home 
 and we were watching T V 
 and this thing came on where a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and robbing them 
 And it was really disgusting 
 And my mom was like "They should just be all shot right now" 
 And you he- 
 Uh
 Yeah
 Yeah Um
 I think they were early twenties
 They were young men
 I know it 
 How deprived could they be if they had a camcorder 
 Those are a thousand bucks
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I wonder where 
 I do not know 
 I wonder where he gets it 
 You know you must 
 I think T V is bad Because they uh show all sorts of violence on 
 Yeah 
 they do not talk to their kids and take them out 
 and are not there all the time 
 so the kids are off to their own devices a lot
 Oh definitely
 I think so definitely 
 When you go to a restaurant and like kids are running all over the place They 
 Yep 
 But they 
 Right 
 I see that too in the Air Force 
 Espec- 
 Oh yeah 
 A lot of uh 
 especially since a lot of us are engineers where I work
 I am in the Air Force 
 Yes
 And so uh people outside the Air Force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do
 And so all the young engineers are like well I am just going you know
 get it for all it is worth 
 And that you know 
 and I am like you are the one who signed up 
 If you did not want to do it 
 And 
 Yep 
 it is
 I like it a lot 
 I like it so far
 Oh
 Probably not 
 But uh they pay for my college 
 So 
 Yeah
 It 
 Yeah 
 And you never know who is watching either
 Huh-uh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 This is New Orleans
 Oh I would hate to be there during Mardi Gras 
 Let me tell 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I know 
 You can't trust anybody
 it is really scary
 Right
 Right
 We 
 Uh-huh
 Well you hear about people opening the door and getting blown away 
 Or people you know Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 I would not want to go by myself
 Uh-huh
 I think our justice system needs to be stricter because they do it 
 and then they get out in a couple of years it seems like They are booked up 
 Yeah
 Right um 
 I do not know Because I am not real up on a lot of news things 
 But you know you just hear about that you know 
 it is a lot of repeat crime 
 And you are like why are they repeating 
 They should have been in there longer 
 Or 
 It seems like a lot of i- 
 that it is more like in Boston 
 there was a case of uh a couple of kids fifteen year olds 
 They wanted to see what it was like to kill someone
 So they picked on this kid who was like new in town 
 And they were like well no one was going to miss him anyway you know 
 and it like 
 ugh that is horrible 
 How can you even think like that
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Oh for the sneakers
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of like you know be
