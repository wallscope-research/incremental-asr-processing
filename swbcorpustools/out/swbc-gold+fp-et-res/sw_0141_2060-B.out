 The topic is to discuss the uh sources where I receive news
 And uh for me that's mostly newspaper and radio 
 I almost never watch television as a matter of course 
 so I don't get news from television 
 except during the war I watched a lot of C N N because it was so good
 Um
 Yeah 
 Um I don't know 
 I guess uh I don't even know why I watched C N N 
 I guess I just wanted more news 
 It's one of the few times I wanted more news than 
 C B S 
 Were they
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 I guess the news just focuses on major events that probably don't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made
 But uh I'm from California 
 and I can remember being uh in these earthquakes 
 and they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed you know from anyone else's point of view 
 but they get all blown up in the news Um
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Right
 Well what newspapers uh do you read in Dallas

 Gosh that sounds pretty bad to me 
 who would steal a newspaper
 Huh

 and I have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them
