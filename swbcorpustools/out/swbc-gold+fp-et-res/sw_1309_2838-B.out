 Gun control seems to be a rather {F uh} timely topic with all that's going on legislation wise
 {C And} {F uh} [the + the] interesting scale that they assigned it {F uh} the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free 
 I'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle I guess 
 [I + I] don't mind regulating [all of the + the] guns 
 {C and} I would certainly call for a ban on certain types 
 {D Now} [the + the] wisdom as to which types that's going to be a debate forever I would assume 
 {F Uh} the method [of + of] controlling it {D well} that's all into how much money you want to put into [the + the] controls 
 {F Uh} one point that was made in the House hearings 
 {C or} 
 the representative stood up and said {D you know} we can check a guy's credit card instantly 
 {C but} {F uh} we don't want to check his background 
 {C and} of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes
 {F uh} 
 {C but} there still [the + the] technology exists [to + to] check it if they want 
 {C So} [it's + it's] kind of a 
 I guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that 
 {C And then} you've got the group of people that decide that [there's + there's] no particular reason to have them at all 
 {C and} you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it 
 {C and} I guess I would fall more in [the + the] realm that I like the sport issue of it 
 {C but} [I + I] could give it up without too much trouble 
 not the world's most pleasurable thing 
 {C and} it costs a bit to do [it + {F uh} finding ranges and things like that]
 {F Uh} I have shot a variety of guns for a number of years 
 {C but} it's just not like golf or whatever 
 {E I mean} there are other things that you could go do 
 {D So} {F uh} [I + I] don't see [the + the] joy of shooting [as + as] that much of a driving factor 
 I think that society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt
 I don't even keep the gun in our house
 {C so} I don't have that problem 
 {C but} {F uh} 
 it's a hard hard topic I guess 
 A lot of people have a hard issue a lot of hard feelings about it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh Boy
 Right
 Dallas
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 About the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that [the + the] person was coming your way 
 Once you're surprised it's too late
 {C And} {C and} the rare circum- 
 {D you know} the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming
 {C and} had time to do anything about it
 {C And} I don't have that problem 
 as I don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one 
 [In the + ] {F uh} N R As {F uh} claim that the {F uh} the constitutional the right to bear arms and that whole statement {F uh} 
 it's hard to know the original intent 
 {C but} [I + I] don't see it as that that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that {F uh} {D yeah} it's the right to to arm a militia [and + ] as opposed to just the general public
 {C And} [you have a + you have a] earn a right 
 not just a privilege as it were if you're going to serve in the militia 
 then you have a right to have that arm 
 {C but} {F uh} 
 {D you know} there's all sorts of arguments there
 {C but} I don't even want to worry about what the original intent was
 they didn't have this problem back then 
 {D So} we change our rights with our social status
 They're man given rights 
 {C and} they can be taken away by a man 
 {C so} 
 {F uh} the people that hide behind that I don't worry about 
 They can go live in another country if they want
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 Tends to tends to strap only the legitimate people 
 Most regulation does 
 {C and} most 
 it's very difficult to {F uh} legislate {F uh} crooks or [whatever you want + however you want to word it]
 {C so} it's 
 {D well} this may be a never ending topic 
 I got a couple of calls waiting on me 
 {C so} I'd better let you go
 Okay bye
