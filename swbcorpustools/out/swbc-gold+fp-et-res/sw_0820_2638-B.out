 Um 
 Basically no 
 Um Yeah 
 I uh uh 
 the policy that T I has I think is uh uh very fair
 Um I 
 they first had a policy where they uh would test new employees 
 and then since I've been with them the last four years uh there's been in the last year year and a half um they're doing random testing of all employees
 Yes
 And it is 
 it 
 and from what I understand it is Jerry Junkins all the way down
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Um I like it because um 
 you know I grew up in the sixties 
 I graduated high school in sixty-eight 
 and uh you know I saw 
 you know I know my friends who were you know druggies and friends who weren't 
 and uh you know I think it's a real problem
 and I think it's causing us a lot of trouble and a lot of problems
 And so I'm hoping that uh a lot of other companies will follow the same path
 Um probably not
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I used to be in D S E G myself Um A P D as a matter of fact
 Yep
 Very aware of it 
 But I really like the idea Uh in fact I would like to see uh a lot more uh people uh adopt it uh like you know school systems and that kind of thing
 I'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or uh who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs
 Yeah
 And I like the idea that they have a uh system where they allow you to uh be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 rather than just uh put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself
 That's not going to help anybody get over the problem
 I believe it is a medical problem
 Um of course I also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too 
 Yeah 
 so there's a lot of things out there 
 and things that uh 
 I'm just glad that they uh decided not to uh tax drugs otherwise they'd be legal
 and they'd be getting tax money off it the same way they are the alcohol and tobacco 
 Yeah 
 I have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy and stuff 
 and uh uh I moved to a T I facility that um had never had uh random drug sampling before because they were outside of the military sector
 It was uh an industrial company you know that T I purchased 
 and so the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it
 Uh they were really opposed to it
 and you know there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs
 and that's why they were opposed to it
 And uh it resulted in a few people leaving you know because they just flat out weren't going to put up with the policy
 You know they had a life-style 
 and they weren't going to change it
 And it's 
 Yeah 
 uh you should have no objection to it 
 it's like uh going down to get your license and checking your eyes
 you know why do I need my eyes checked 
 well we want to make sure you can see 
 You know it's like why are we doing this 
 Well so you don't kill people on the road
 Uh it's a ba- 
 it's the basic premise with you know drug testing
 Especially some of the jobs um 
 luckily I've always been in the engineering sector
 and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as uh you know hurting someone 
 it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it
 But uh in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor and down in some of those labs and stuff yeah darn if I'd want somebody down there that I'm working with side by side you know that could kill me by doing something incorrectly because they were not exactly all there because they were on drugs
 So there's a lot of sectors where I think that would would help out 
 and I think in the long run we all benefit/
 if you have uh 
 you know if you're not working with someone on drugs well then you're going to have less accidents
 and you have less accidents 
 and you spend less money on medical
 And you spend less money on medical then the company's more profitable
 The company's more profitable then maybe they can pay you more 
 If they can pay you more you can buy more
 and it 
 and it goes around you know to everywhere
 Yep 
 all over
 And uh 
 It certainly does 
 and I just hope that uh more and more companies uh get on the ball
 and start it up
 Well a lot of companies are coming down in price
 and I think that the insurance companies are starting to give uh benefits
 You know reduction in medical costs if you know they 
 Yeah 
 so I think everybody will benefit from the program
 And I think if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say well if you impose uh mandatory drug testing we'll reduce your insurance costs by you know twenty per cent 
 And of course you know the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent they're going to reduce their own
 Yeah 
 and that'll cover it 
 And maybe some insurance companies might start offering it uh as part of the package
 Yeah 
 So it 
 I think all around it's going to help out a lot
 Course 
 Yeah
 It was great talking with you
 You do the same
 Bye-bye
