 That's right 
 that's right 
 You know uh what do you think is important 
 If you were 
 uh I don't know how old you are 
 but if you had uh parents say or grandparents whatever it is uh who were ready who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for
 Huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Huh 
 Well uh uh my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in uh Minnesota 
 and we go there uh once a year 
 we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston 
 so we're pretty far away 
 When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her
 And it seems uh 
 the environment there I don't know too much about it 
 but it seems nice enough 
 Uh it's hard 
 at least half of the residents I would say are not mentally sound 
 So it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to retain uh clarity say uh you know 
 Yeah 
 Well I don't know 
 we also my wife and I uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that's just a mile from our house 
 uh she goes more often than I 
 We used to go once every two months to visit some of the patients there 
 And we have a two year old son 
 and so sometimes we'd take him with us 
 And uh there I would say it's the same thing 
 it's a uh relatively nice environment 
 but again um it must be depressing for the people who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but uh certainly have retained all of their uh mental skills and so on 
 It's must be depressing to walk the halls and see all these other people who really don't know where they are
 I think yeah 
 I think they're relatively respectful Yeah and concerned in as much as they can be 
 you know I've noticed uh uh some of the patients asking for things uh just repetitively but things that are not reasonable 
 and so at some level the uh 
 I'm sure that uh the staff learn what's normal for this person 
 and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person you know is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need you know
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 I'll tell you one thing though that I saw that was really nice 
 We saw a husband and wife 
 we used to see a husband and wife in there uh together 
 and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were 
 but these two were
 And when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house 
 And so 
 Yeah 
 you walked in there 
 and it didn't look like uh you know how you walk into some rooms 
 and it's completely generic 
 There's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person 
 and that's it 
 But this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that 
 and they had all their stuff from their house 
 and it looked like uh it must have been 
 it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them 
 and it must also give them a sense of uh uh security and you know s- uh 
 Yeah 
 Huh 
 Yeah 
 Huh 
 temporary 
 I 
 that's new to me 
 I 
 Right 
 right
