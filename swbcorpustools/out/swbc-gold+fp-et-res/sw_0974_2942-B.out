 Uh-huh 
 Well having been there not too long ago and my wife having only recently completed a doctorate I'm fairly full of it myself
 Uh the main point that I have about choosing where you want to go to school is that you have to early on define what it is you want to do or at least what area you want to be in 
 Uh I had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized 
 I went through a number of them uh undergraduate schools before I found a good school that was more general uh to give me time to make up my mind
 That's wonderful 
 I'm a great proponent of liberal arts education for anybody
 Uh being an engineer now I believe in it even more strongly than I did before
 Well thus far it's working to my advantage 
 Uh the great gap historically with engineers has been while they may have all this technical information they have no way of imparting it except to another engineer
 And I have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that nonengineers can understand
 Well it's a lot of fun at the moment
 Even at that I have a son who's only nine at the moment 
 But I see him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality 
 and uh if he decides to pursue that I'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college before I'll even let him go to an engineering college
 And yes 
 that'll add one year to his education experience
 Yes 
 it is 
 Oh I agree 
 Uh I have the experience uh 
 the last school that I went to was Mississippi State University which is historically an engineering and agricultural school
 Uh the typical land grant university 
 every state's got one
 Anyway while it has both engineering and liberal arts the engineering students tend to cluster together
 You know they're in classes together even when they're outside of the engineering department
 And they don't learn the communications 
 they don't learn the thought processes of other fields of endeavor
 that's kind of like if I were king for a day and got to make one rule My rule would be no one could get out of high school without an entire year of philosophy
 And that's not even true in our colleges
 Right 
 Yes I remember that experience
 that and uh extra music classes
 Well that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school
 have you gone straight through
 That's true 
 Are you pursuing a Master's or a Doctorate
 Well let me encourage you to stop and experience life along the way
 I first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty-six
 Uh six years and a war later uh I got an undergraduate degree 
 And then fifteen years after that I got the first of a set of master's degrees 
 and four years after that I got another master's degree
 Oh yes
 it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier
 Well vicarious learning is a wonderful thing
 It certainly means that we don't have to experience everything 
 but experience is a wonderful teacher also
 My wife as I may have mentioned just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago
 and she pursued her education along the lines that I did with lots of break in between 
 And she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now 
 She has an awful lot of experience to draw on 
 No longer
