 I don't know 
 Uh I haven't 
 it's been uh well seventy-nine since I was At high school 
 And uh I've seen things change 
 I don't know if I've seen things change enough that I can actually 
 because I wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then 
 so it's hard to compare 
 You know what I mean 
 But uh it seems like when I lived in Chicago 
 I've lived down here 
 I hear the dropout rates from the schools
 and I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year
 And I begin to wonder if I'm really getting my money's worth
 I've seen so many different things so many different bad reports coming out of the school system 
 and I recognize that there are good schools out there 
 somebody's getting a good education because we continue to employ people 
 But uh uh I don't understand I guess why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities
 I don't know if I blame it on the school 
 I think I blame it on a couple of different things 
 I think I blame it on the school system Uh 
 Yeah 
 I don't blame it on the teachers in the school 
 although I think that 
 I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than 
 well they do quite well for themselves 
 No 
 Not all school districts are well paid 
 But there are some school districts out there that are very well paid 
 I know one family that's got 
 they're both teachers 
 and they both have like second jobs that they work in the afternoons 
 They both work all summer full-time 
 And from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each
 I mean that family is making over a hundred grand 
 And I'm 
 okay 
 okay 
 Yes 
 I agree that teaching our kids is important
 However these people who only work eight hours day at it from seven to three
 and they only work nine months a year 
 and they get an awful lot of breaks in between 
 and that's my tax dollars that I'm spending on that 
 And I don't even have kids
