 Uh fantasizing about
 Can't do it right now 
 Our situation is that we're a two car family
 and I have a mini van we bought a few years ago
 It's got a uh five year loan 
 so that's still got a couple years to run
 and the car I get to drive is a uh Nissan Sentra that's going to be ten years old next month 
 so I think about uh sprucing that up in a couple years if I can
 Well since I just turned forty I'm thinking about a forty year old man's car uh something real sporty
 but uh realistically with uh the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that uh wouldn't wined up putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat
 *[[spelling wined should be wind]] Something a little seating room 
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Sure
 Yeah 
 I was surprised to hear that the V eights are coming back 
 so they've got some pretty powerful sixes
 And uh you know V eights seem to be a return to the days of you know ten or twelve miles a gallon
 Sure
 Is uh traction much of an issue for you up there
 Actually uh pretty good way of looking at it 
 yeah 
 uh we had a small accident with our mini van a few years ago 
 A case where there was a sort of freak ice storm 
 and we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car 
 and this is a rear wheel drive model 
 So we got some monster studded snow tires after that
 Haven't had any problems since
 It's a Mazda
 And uh we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and uh driveability 
 Fuel economy isn't great being a mini van 
 but uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others 
 and it's uh got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around 
 so we've been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 I think that we're going to be uh owning a mini van for some years to come 
 Probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway
 Uh I'd be satisfied with a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra
 And even as light as that is with uh the small tires it's done pretty well in winter 
 uh again like you if conditions are that bad I probably don't want to be driving anyway
 So I know I'd be happy with a reasonable uh four door 
 You know again we've got the same issue with getting kids into the
