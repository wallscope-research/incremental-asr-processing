 Well do you do any recycling
 Yeah
 Oh
 Well we uh 
 there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is uh aluminum cans
 But uh we've got a couple of different uh places uh 
 they're like unattended aluminum can smashers 
 And you can go up there and uh redeem 
 we've got one that gives you like a penny a can 
 so if you 
 Yeah 
 Well actually you have to put them in there unsmashed
 And uh when you do that it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot
 Sure
 Okay
 Okay
 Well I heard it that time 
 Uh no 
 you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that
 Oh okay
 Okay 
 no 
 they don't charge us that extra nickel
 Yeah 
 it really is 
 Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the price if you want to think of it that way
 So when we get like uh uh a twelve pack then that's like twelve cents back
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 everybody does newspapers
 Yeah
 Well shoot maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed uh Pepsi cans and whatever up there 
 I tell you what really works uh at least down here is if there is even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it you know what I mean then people tend to do it Uh
 In other words taking care of the environment is all well and good
 but if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment they're not quite as uh likely to do it as uh if you get something back for it You know
 uh so you know if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer you know it kind of reminds me of using an A T M card you know to get money or doing your banking
 You know if it's free people will use it 
 if it costs them something then they're not as likely to use it
 You know 
 But uh I know we had a problem down here with uh people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the drain sewer 
 {C And uh all that because there was 
 apparently a lot of people you know every time they change the oil 
 they just dump all their old oil down there
 Now they're starting to recycle that stuff
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I know a lot of places they uh uh
