 Okay 
 is uh that a sport you like to participate in
 Uh-huh 
 My husband likes golf also 
 uh I guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it 
 But he limits it pretty good 
 I um have tried to go out and play golf 
 He would love it if I would go out and play with him 
 but I stand there and swing and swing 
 and I can't even hit the ball 
 Yeah 
 I don't either 
 Right
 Oh so he's really into it
 Wow
 Oh
 Yeah
 Right 
 more because of their personalities than their sportsman 
 Right 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Oh he's interesting
 I like to watch him
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I think you're right
 Yeah
 I like to watch those skins games
 Do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain amou- you know 
 for each hole they win they get the money for it 
 I think those are pretty exciting
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Oh really 
 I sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated and mad at themselves when they don't do well 
 My husband and his buddies are not very good 
 They play like maybe once a month or less
 and so they all hit like in the low nineties 
 and they think they're having a really good game 
 So 
 Wow
 Yeah 
 that is good
 Right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Something to stay active at for a long time
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 and they can still get good at it
 Well maybe that's what I'll do when I have time later on
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 True
 Right 
 yeah 
 Or my favorite 
 just ride around in the cart with him 
 Go somewhere really nice like Hawaii and just look at the golf course
 Oh yeah 
 But my husband's pretty tolerant 
 so he's not too bad to watch
 Oh no 
 yeah
 Gosh 
 Now my husband has a temper 
 but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course 
 because he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature he thought it was and stuff
 So I guess he's real laid back about it
 he'll come home though when he was shooting in the hundreds 
 and he'll tell me what a great day he had and about this great shot he made and everything 
 Yeah 
 this one on this one hole 
 Did you have to listen to long stories about now on the seventeenth hole I hit it and went this way
 it's hard for me to act nice about that when it goes on and on
 Yes
 Right 
 and then they want to play another course they're not a member of
 and other fees
 It really is high
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Me either
 Yeah 
 at least you're competing against yourself I guess more than everybody else out there
 Yeah 
 that's kind of the way I feel
 Oh
 Right
