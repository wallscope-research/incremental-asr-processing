 Okay 
 Uh do you live in a home
 Uh-huh
 Oh did you
 Uh-huh
 We've lived in ours for about six years 
 We had it built actually
 And uh uh it's our first home too
 Yeah
 Um well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in 
 and um that was quite an experience 
 I much prefer having my own home and uh just the space and more privacy
 Yeah
 Um uh uh it's like twenty-four fifty square feet
 It's a two story
 Yeah 
 How about yours
 Is it small
 Oh really
 Oh uh-huh 
 do you have children
 Just one
 Oh
 Oh uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 yeah 
 Well like um how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood 
 Oh uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh
 Yeah 
 it seems about oh probably average Um
 But our neighborhood has just a wide variety of um people 
 and you know there's older people here and um people that are our age 
 we're in our thirties
 And um there's a lot of kids 
 People across the street have eight
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 their home just burned down matter of fact um last summer 
 and they're just rebuilding 
 and um their house is going to be really big 
 It's 
 Yeah 
 they're building a lot bigger 
 He's uh um uh oh not an obstetrician an orthopedic surgeon
 um so since the house did burn they're going 
 it's quite different than it was before 
 and it's a lot bigger
 um but ours is about 
 you know it's a nice home 
 it's definitely not one of the smaller ones 
 and um it's not the biggest either 
 But 
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 You 
 You know that's interesting 
 you say that because we have those architectural codes here
 and when we um put out house in um they wanted us to have 
 there was one 
 we have part siding on the two story part and then on the back 
 and there was one side where our chimney was 
 and just the chimney was going to be brick 
 and they wanted us to have more brick 
 so we ended up having to go halfway up
 it does look nicer 
 and you know we would have like to have had all brick 
 but of course at that point we couldn't afford it 
 but it's funny that you'd say that because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all
 So it's kind of like they were
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and so it was kind of like it's they 
 ours is the last street that they built on 
 So the houses actually on our street they're kind of gone a little bit nicer
 Yeah 
 just they you know 
 it's like the second phase
 and so they've kind of changed the codes a little bit 
 and so that's kind of why I guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any
 Oh uh-huh
