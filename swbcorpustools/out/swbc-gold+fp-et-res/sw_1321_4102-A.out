 So what do you think about caring for older folks Dale
 Uh-huh
 Right
 very definitely
 Uh-huh
 Well I'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old 
 They aren't really that old 
 but they are sort of wearing out 
 My mamma is a dialysis patient
 and she is only about sixty-four 
 but she's had some pretty close calls 
 and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now 
 and so she's phasing out {sounds like} 
 and but she's also a very very very independent person and doesn't like having having people uh not being able to do things for herself when she wants to
 uh I know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home 
 but my daddy keeps talking about it 
 I don't 
 I couldn't possibly couldn't never see him in a nursing home
 And my grand daddy also doesn't like wouldn't want to be in a nursing home 
 He's ninety I think right on ninety right now
 and he's living by himself 
 My grand mamma died a couple of years ago
 so but he's you know 
 as long as you can have the families take care of the people I'd like to see them stay at home
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 especially for your uncle I bet
 Now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with Alzheimer 
 Do they have anything like that in Dallas
 Right 
 So they are pretty limited
 Oh another interesting thing 
 another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology wa- well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives To make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities
 I don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients but just patients people in general who were not as independent as they use to be
 Uh-huh {very faint}
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 to uh get there and to participate in the activities
 Right
 Right
 That's true 
 You can't play those things
 But you can sing songs and uh and tell stories about the old times 
 I guess you know you were talking about your 
 was it your grand mother that was having Alzheimer uh being able to tell old stories 
 You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way
 Do they like to listen to other people recollect though
 
 Right
 Well that is good because we
