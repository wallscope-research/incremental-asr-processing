 Well I guess a lot of the uh 
 something that's kind of more of a comedy 
 We do have uh cable 
 and we have premium stations like H B O and Showtime and such 
 and I guess a lot of times when I first turn the T V on I normally go to those because I pay for them 
 I guess I want to see if there's anything I really want to see there so I don't end up watching the um prime time on some of the standard channels as much I tend to go to my premium channels first
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Monday night's pretty good with MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 We had watched it uh I guess Sunday night and Monday night 
 but we didn't get to watch it tonight
 Uh-huh/
 Uh-huh
 The only night we tend to watch some of that is on Sunday nights starting fairly late like I'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight 
 They have some British comedy that we've really liked 
 and there's a variety 
 Some of them is uh BLACK ADDER or GOOD NEIGHBORS or YES PRIME MINISTER and ARE YOU BEING SERVED
 they rotate those around 
 and um we like that British comedy 
 British comedy is very fast 
 you really have to listen
 but 
 They're real good 
 but they do come on kind of late 
 but we really do enjoy those 
 Sometimes we get to watching some stuff on the Discovery Channel
 And I'm amazed sometimes what I see on there 
 But I'm very intrigued 
 one time I was watching an operation 
 and I thought Gee I don't believe I'm watching
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Right
 Yeah 
 I'm not into watching sports 
 Now my husband likes to watch football 
 he's not really into uh baseball or basketball too much 
 but uh football soon as it's fall then he likes to watch college on Saturday and then of course Cowboys on Sunday
 Yeah
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Um
 Yeah 
 the 
 you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff
 yeah 
 those are pretty good but true to life 
 some of the
