 Well the 
 I think I'm skeptical about the whole thing Uh and still a little bit worried about them because of the history of Russia
 And they're in a state of flux right now uh uh changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress
 And even in that situation uh it seems like to me from what I've read in the history of Russia and you know different authors uh there has always been a paranoia 
 They've always suspected everybody 
 and you know that's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years 
 and that's why they put a lot of people to death
 Yes 
 but Stalin was a classical example I guess of that paranoia because he probably killed more Russians than uh you know the Russian army killed anybody else
 Yeah
 Sure
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think you're right
 There's a little more craziness down there 
 Uh the Russian people I think are not that much different from us 
 You know I think that it would be the leadership that I uh mistrust
 Yeah
 You too 
 Thank you
 Bye-bye
