 <> With the plastic
 Well I thought it was sad that it started out as a good program *[[two utts]] But then people started dumping trash and the wrong objects in there 
 and that concerned me that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didn't want to set at the curb or take to the dump 
 and uh it's too bad that people have to ruin a good part thing
 But uh 
 Um
 Oh
 Doing it 
 What did she do with 
 if she 
 was she like a group that was doing it
 or was she doing it on her own 
 and what did she do with the 
 Uh-huh
 you have to really want to do it though
 This is 
 even what you recycle 
 because we do the plastics and the aluminum and the glass and the paper
 um and of course then you know you try to buy right too 
 but *[[slash error]] Um a lot of our neighbors say well you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure it's that *[[sd]] and you have to 
 we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans
 And I thought what are you complaining about when you're only going to get picked up once a month you know or once a week 
 and 
 Rather than work with it
 Yeah
 Well it's for everybody's benefit
 it's not 
 so maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime 
 but you have to think grandchildren and great grandchildren 
 and what kind of quality of life are you leaving them
 and I have a real concern about that
 Uh
 We've never had much trash 
 because while 
 I was raised in a big family 
 and Gene's family wasn't big 
 but they weren't rich 
 and they had to recycle
 and you know the fu- 
 well they didn't 
 they just used things 
 they didn't throw things away before they were used up 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Right
 They've picked up the hab- 
 Well they do 
 and when they actually get out away from the home and have to do their own buying of things then they say well hey you know mom used to do this and dad used to do that
 and pretty soon they're figuring out that's not such a bad way 
 *[[slash error with utt2; one utt]] to go *[[slash error]] But 
 *[[%]] Right 
 Well see this is what concerns me 
 You 
 over in Europe they don't have the kind of waste we do here
 you've got to be in a country 
 even in Mexico you don't see things thrown away like we do here
 what we throw away is a ransom a king's ransom to most people
 and I 
 and even to people in our country who scavenge for food 
 and I think you have to get into a period of need bef- 
 you can't tell a person that lives in a hundred two hundred three hundred thousand dollar house that have all that they need and all that they could want that they've got to be careful
 uh this is why I thought Jimmy Carter was never very pos- 
 you know people didn't like him
 Because he tried to say turn off the lights conserve this do that
 and uh nobody wanted to hear it
 It's 
 Uh-huh
 <> Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right
 Huh
 I think the big question too we're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled
 that's right 
 and uh do we have to wait until all the landfills are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage
 and I don't 
 with the mind set of the American public I think what they will do is start paying Mexico to take our trash *[[slash error]] that isn't harmful
 *[[sv]] Or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean
 That's the way we solve problems
 And it's sad
