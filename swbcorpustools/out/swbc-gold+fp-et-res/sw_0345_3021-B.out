 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I think I'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself
 You know I have quite a collection myself 
 and you know I'm a good hunter 
 and I started hunting when I was twelve years old 
 Of course my parents made me take hunters safety classes 
 and you know I don't want to see them ban guns completely 
 but I don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either 
 so 
 I believe that
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and you know it's got to the point now where even our police departments and our D E A agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons 
 because everybody that's in drug trafficking has got them
 You know Yeah 
 So 
 Um
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that would be 
 Yeah 
 that's 
 No 
 it's sure not 
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Um
 Yeah
 See In California they make you register when you buy ammunition
 You have to sign a you know 
 they take your name and driver's license number hunting license number and all that good stuff before you can buy any big ammunition Especially for handguns
 now rifles aren't too bad 
 but you know any kind of handgun at all if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you would still have to buy it or sign up for it 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Gee
 Gee that's not a bad idea
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it is
 No 
 the only way they could do it I think would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun
 You know I think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course 
 I feel kind of weird about that anyway 
 I think if somebody shoots somebody they ought to be shot
 So 
 Yeah 
 but you know 
 It would definitely be gun control 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Myself
 Yeah 
 Well and they're actually a necessity in life you know 
 They're not you know 
 not everybody needs a gun 
 but sooner or later I need one 
 You know whether I'm out hunting or you know 
 I'm never had to protect my life or 
 well I did in the service but you know not on the street 
 so I don't really need one in the aspects 
 No 
 huh-uh
 No 
 So you know I use mine for recreation
 I don't 
 and I enjoyed my guns
 I have a good time with them 
 so 
 Yeah
 Probably 
 Yeah
 No 
 huh-uh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I had to explain that to my 
 I've got a six year old now 
 and he you know 
 I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old well 
 they understand now
 You know I've taken time to teach them 
 and now the young boy wants to know 
 and you know like I told him you're a little bit young for a gun Let me go out here and you know we would start with the B B gun deal you know
 so he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows 
 and I took it away from him 
 I said now you know so he's learning the hard way 
 but at least it was a B B gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something 
 so 
 Um
 Uh-huh
 All right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 All right 
 I think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one
 You know I don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away 
 so 
 Yeah 
 I think so
 All right 
 have a good one 
 Bye-bye
