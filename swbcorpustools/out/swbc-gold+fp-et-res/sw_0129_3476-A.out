 For N I S T the National Institute of Standards and Technology
 I suppose so 
 Let me push the button
 Okay uh 
 I guess I'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system 
 but uh I sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon
 Uh-huh
 You're now in what
 Acoustics uh
 Well I guess that is the policy 
 but it's been the policy for a long time 
 and nothing ever happens 
 Uh I suppose some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening having a new generation come up that's more used to it
 They have to for international trade
 But I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be uh because uh of computers coming into everything
 Everyone wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a concept to hold in mind
 Uh I don't see that it can change it very quickly 
 we're not the kind of society uh that something can be posed upon uh by government will
 Uh the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems uh money dollar coins anything like that
 and it obviously makes no sense that we're practically alone in the world in using the old system
 Well unfortunate- I think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day
 Uh there are things you could do 
 Uh we have signs up on the N I S T campus here speed limit twenty-five miles per hour forty kilometers per hour
 Uh but that hasn't been adopted very widely
 and no one will go a step further to remove the english signs
 Uh yeah 
 or you have highway signs saying speed limit uh eighty eighty-five whatever would be the appropriate number
 Hundred car is going sixty-two 
 yeah 
 so it would be more uh like ninety I guess 
 car is going fifty-five 
 Uh you suddenly have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now
 do you know where you are
 do the schools emphasize the metric system
 No 
 down like in the elementary schools
 I think 
 Yeah 
 I think my children learned the metric system 
 but it doesn't get emphasized over the other
