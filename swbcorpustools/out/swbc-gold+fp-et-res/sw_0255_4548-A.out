 Well actually uh 
 I don't think I'm in the uh majority in Texas 
 I don't think I agree with 
 No
 Uh I wouldn't say that 
 I think I would have said that a few years ago
 When I was younger I thought it was uh a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have uh capital punishment 
 but um uh maybe slowly changing my opinion
 I'm not thoroughly opposed to it 
 I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment 
 but I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I certainly don't uh advocate turning people like that loose
 I'm not sure executing them uh does anymore than keeping them in jail 
 but uh 
 Yeah 
 that's a factor 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well I 
 the cost is something 
 but but I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of dealing with crime 
 and I guess I would like 
 I don't know 
 the European countries certainly uh none of them have capital punishment 
 and they don't have a crime problem either 
 No 
 you can't 
 they don't execute anybody in Britain or France 
 and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either 
 and they don't have the crime problems we do 
 I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two
 I guess what worries me about capital punishment is uh when I see people enthusiastic about it and uh uh sort of bloodthirsty I think it brings out the worst in the people who do the punishing 
 and that bothers me 
 But it 
 but uh 
 Huh
 Yeah
 Huh
 Well actually I wha- 
 the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because uh I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else 
 I think it just becomes a uh symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians 
 so 
 I would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh 
 Like I said some years ago I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the civilized western country
 Now I'm not so sure of that 
 I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around
 Uh I guess I'm 
 my view of uh 
 my 
 I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and uh that uh uh costs and other factors justify uh uh executing people
 Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture uh uh than anything else 
 and uh I've also never been a victim although I have two friends whose wives were murdered 
 and uh I can imagine that uh uh for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case
