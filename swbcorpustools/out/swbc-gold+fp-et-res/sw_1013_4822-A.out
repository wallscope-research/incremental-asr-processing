 Okay 
 Go ahead
 Oh
 Sure 
 Uh-huh
 Oh you're kidding 
 Yeah
 Huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Sure 
 Oh that's good because sometimes I wonder you know being a uh lay person out there not uh knowing exactly what's going on in space Whether you know they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not 
 we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here 
 Being you know 
 to me all this uh space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth That uh we can't live on Mars 
 We can't live here 
 we can't live there 
 this is the place that we have to live 
 there's uh no other resource for us to look at other than here 
 So it's kind of like to me 
 I would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space 
 and what you know 
 not that I want everything to halt 
 and let's forget about the space program or whatever 
 because we're always curious 
 and we always need to know more things 
 But uh to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here 
 Let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here 
 Mainly because uh 
 the space program has taught us that there is no other place for us 
 this is it 
 uh if we would have went into space and found Mars a livable uh planet we probably would have inhabited it 
 and uh you know who would have cared about earth 
 It would have been another planet to kind of take over and uh continue on 
 you know and that 
 when I look at the space program itself I think of it you know as being in terms of it's interesting to learn but it brings down the fact that this earth is it 
 It's it for us you know what I mean Uh unless technology makes the decision that we are all going to live in space or whatever 
 But I would love to uh go into the space shuttle some day and uh just see uh you know the earth and the different planets and things like that 
 I think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do I don't know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Exactly 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Exactly 
 Yeah 
 that's true you know 
 And I think of uh 
 I'm sure you probably have heard of the Genesis program that's going on currently out in the Arizona desert
 Uh uh you know they're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create you know an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it 
 and then they have an area that's more uh you know full of uh vegetation tropicals that kind of thing to kind of look at things and say you know environment wise this is where we're living 
 but what effects it 
 and how can we improve it and things like that 
 And I think in space uh 
 I don't know how many people could live up in space uh for any length of time 
 just the way that we're affected by when it's cloudy out 
 and it's cloudy for days 
 and we don't see the sun 
 and the people their moods are extreme you know 
 It's like God if I don't get to see the sun I'm going to be in this bad mood all this entire time 
 and this is how I see people reacting 
 You know when is the sun going to come out 
 So I wonder how you know somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun You know in the aspect that we see it Uh and never seeing uh you know light bright days you know 
 And
