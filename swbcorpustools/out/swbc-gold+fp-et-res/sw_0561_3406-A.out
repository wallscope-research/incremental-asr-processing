 So what do you uh think is uh the worst culprit for air pollution
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 uh I 
 it's hard to put the finger on uh what's worse know the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion um with uh your hydrocarbons uh causing the damage in which 
 Well I notice on one of these uh home shopping networks they were selling these uh halogen uh fire extinguishers
 and the halogen is uh an ozone depleter 
 and it got hydrocarbons in there 
 It's a very clean uh fire extinguisher 
 but it's you know really bad on the environment
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I know 
 uh in the Twin Cities area 
 I just moved out of there and was kind of happy I timed it just right 
 but they had a new policy where in order to get uh your uh your car license uh renewed you had to meet the pollution standards
 and uh 
 Yeah
 Yeah uh 
 yeah 
 I guess that was just mainly in the cities there 
 and as far as where I live I don't have to do that 
 but I have an old car which I doubt uh would uh pass the inspection a seventy-six 
 and uh you know there's no way I would put in a lot of money to repair it to meet standards
 Yeah 
 So although I do what I can to cut down pollution 
 but uh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well well around here we get uh 
 well it depends you know 
 either in the winter time it blows it your way 
 and in the summer time we probably get yours
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well it uh that's a big thing too 
 I know it has nothing to do with air pollution 
 but I kind of look at the way people treat our
