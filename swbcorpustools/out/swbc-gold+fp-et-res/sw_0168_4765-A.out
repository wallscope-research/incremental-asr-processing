 Uh a lot of companies now are using uh drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to root out the either uh elementary or intermediate or advanced uh drug users
 And uh I know the government uh you know gives drug tests to all new applicants coming into government
 and I quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it 
 I guess I'm not a good civil libertarian
 and I feel uh uh uh you know that if you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background 
 Of course we're 
 being involved in my organization uh we have deep background checks 
 uh but sometimes you know drug use can escape that 
 And uh I have absolutely no compunction about uh using any and all means to uh uh you know figure out who has a drug problem uh and putting that guy into therapy to you know break this uh activity 
 Of course if he's fallen in love with drugs 
 and there isn't anything 
 but getting stoned or high is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope 
 What's your uh feeling
 Uh-huh
 Well I think uh uh uh uh the first morphine laws were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that
 Yeah 
 Well the thing of it is that is uh uh in many respects uh uh you know just I think an over simplification 
 I think there's so much criminal activity uh that people go into to support drug habits 
 Yeah 
 You know they support drug habits uh you know with things like uh you know burglary or prostitution or stuff like that 
 yeah 
 I must admit that 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I must admit that the production costs of these drugs are zippo compared to the street market costs and the costs to society 
 yeah 
 But I think that you know being in law enforcement you know I probably have a kind of a draconian Philistine attitude toward it
 but uh uh I really feel as though the interdiction effort is 
 as soon as you get rid of one goon that's involved in drugs and tha- 
 Yeah 
 and then another one will jump up 
 But we see 
 Yeah 
 as soon as we wind up uh uh you know for 
 well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand 
 but people want to get stoned 
 and I don't see that 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
