 I've lost track 
 I don't really know 
 I do have some opinions 
 but go ahead
 Uh okay 
 I hadn't thought about that uh
 Uh well I just have an opinion 
 now I thought the terrorism thing was overstated 
 there was nothing over here 
 In fact even 
 this is not our subject I guess 
 but uh maybe it is or isn't I suppose
 My wife when she talked about the Middle East 
 and everyone's afraid you know of how the war was going to go and everything 
 I told her no 
 it's just not going to happen 
 There's not going to be any terrorism over him 
 and there wasn't you know 
 They just didn't have an organization 
 but uh I'm concerned that we don't have enough controls 
 I think that uh the Asian gangsters that we've let in here 
 and the guys from uh Cuba you know there's a lot of criminals down in Florida that we've let in from Cuba that Fidel pushed off on us 
 uh and the last you know 
 out of all the Asians we brought in there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from Asia 
 and I think that there's got to be some sort of controls over that 
 this Asia mafia thing is getting out of hand
 I don't even know what our controls are 
 I don't even know what uh if we have any guidelines at all uh on immigration 
 Um I always thought that we did 
 but I don't know what they are right now
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 The *[[slash error]] Yeah
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] Because we 
 I do have some sympathy with uh you know 
 of course we have this big Mexican problem 
 not a problem 
 but I think that we need to do something with uh the immigration of back and forth across Mexico uh
 I'm sympathetic 
 I don't know what the answer is 
 I'm sympathetic certainly with that that they want to come over here 
 and I guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work 
 And if they have jobs you know I hear the story that they're taking away American jobs 
 But I don't know uh 
 I don't know how many American jobs they are really taking away
 So I'm sympathetic 
 but I don't have an answer 
 uh I think that we should have good relations with Mexico 
 but that's not really exactly immigration 
 It is 
 and it isn't 
 I don't know to what degree we owe the people who come across before they're citizens 
 owe the children education and all that uh 
 although the idea of education is an answer to a lot of problems in the world 
 So I guess it's what they 
 the Mexican kids get a good education along the way 
 and maybe that's a benefit to everybody you know
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 And that 
 Yeah 
 I never thought that they were much 
 I do cringe when I hear some of the problems we've had
 Um uh of course you mentioned the language 
 I feel so bad that we here in Texas or certainly the southern part of the United States uh California Texas and all that why our kids don't speak fluid Spanish uh by junior high you know as well as us you know
 so that we wouldn't have the language barrier certainly 
 that is a shame that we have this tremendous border of Mexico 
 and then in Europe you know they speak their French and all 
 and they go out of their way to try to speak their neighbor's language so they can understand 
 we don't really even make an effort to speak Spanish 
 and I feel bad about that <> 
 Go ahead
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I guess it's never too late 
 I do have some Spanish books 
 and I've always uh 
 every year I say I'm going to try to speak some newcomers language you know 
 I don't know if it's costing us any money 
 or how much money they're putting into it uh 
 that's always a factor 
 my wife says How much the federal government is putting into it immigration
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Oh yeah 
 I think that certainly is a problem 
 I guess our immigration history that's a great subject 
 They uh didn't say to talk about that 
 but that is 
 on Ellis Island they 
 you know they're redoing that and going to make it a national museum 
 That certainly was interesting 
 since all of us had uh ancestors that came over that way 
 Or not all 
 but I guess if you go back far enough you came over on a boat originally you know 
 But uh a lot of us have grandparents 
 my grandparents came over in about eighteen ninety or something like that 
 And I'm sure they came over you know through Ellis Island you know
 So we all immigrants one way or another well 
 we certainly are coming from Europe
 Oh yeah 
 those were laws are unusual
 Yeah 
 but I don't understand whose rule is that you know *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 *[[slash error]] sometimes common sense should take over rather than 
 yeah 
 that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all that you would do it that way
 You would think they could at least get a visa or something until they uh get citizenship 
 I'm sure they want to
 Oh yeah
 I heard something about that yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Oh no 
 Oh no 
 you could see why
 I don't know how much immigration we have from Europe and everything 
 What the controls are
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I guess you can get work visas pretty easily uh
 Yeah
 Oh really
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh well yeah
 Yeah 
 well it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the few countries that people are still desperately trying to immigrate to 
 Uh although I guess Europe now that the Communism is falling apart that maybe there'll won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the Communist countries uh 
 I guess Poland now is noncommunist 
 so maybe not 
 maybe immigration from Europe to here will you know slowly uh change 
 maybe it'll even out like trade you know 
 So many people will immigrate here at the year two thousand 
 so many of the people will go back overseas 
 You know maybe it will average out 
 I don't know
 It doesn't seem so far
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Are you a teacher
 Oh really 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
