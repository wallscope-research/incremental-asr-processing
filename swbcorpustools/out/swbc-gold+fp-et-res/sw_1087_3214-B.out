 Okay 
 my name is Terry
 Okay
 Oh yes uh 
 there's COUNTRY LIVING 
 there's COUNTRY 
 and uh 
 Oh yeah
 Sure
 Oh that's great
 Well I actually take COUNTRY LIVING 
 it's a country magazine on HOUSE BEAUTIFUL because I like um that kind of stuff 
 Decorating and uh getting ideas for a garden 
 In fact uh right before you called I was planning my tulips and uh putting them on blue print on where I'm going to put them 
 so I'm really into that 
 but uh so I really get into magazines that are kind of basically into um housing type things be decorating and gardening and recipes that kind of stuff 
 So I'm pretty much in the same category as what you're looking at
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I've had TIME before
 I think with that what happens is uh it's interesting to read
 but you kind of just put the magazine away 
 and you never read it again unless there's some big article in there that you're going to keep for your kids 
 but 
 Yeah 
 it sounds exactly like what we did
 we just saved everything we could for our daughter 
 but uh that's pretty similar 
 but I find that with these COUNTRY magazines I keep going back to them getting ideas looking back and saying Jeez there was a flower garden in there that I would like to have some ideas 
 I get a lot of ideas from them
 Yes 
 we do 
 We're out in the country
 we're right across from a river 
 and uh you're right the leaves are beautiful 
 and they are falling now 
 so 
 Uh it just peaked uh last week 
 and it was just gorgeous out here 
 but 
 Yeah 
 it's beautiful 
 The other thing about magazines the only thing I don't like is they really get heavily into advertising
 and you know it's fine 
 I'd rather almost have 
 I know that part probably half their money comes from these people that are saying uh Put my ad in your paper and I'll pay you or whatever 
 but uh there's been some magazines I've looked at 
 and it's a real turn off to see every other page some kind of ad 
 Yeah 
 VOGUE is heavily into that 
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 it's almost 
 you could go into a store and get bombarded the same way 
 but uh Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 exactly
 Exactly 
 yeah 
 they're really getting into that 
 so 
 But pretty much like I said the magazines I've had BETTER HOMES AND GARDEN 
 and now I need a switch 
 and I'm going back to GOURMET COOKING because um I've had the magazine before back in nineteen uh eighty-six 
 and I thought Well I'll give it a try again because you get tired of one magazine 
 and you need to try a change
 Uh yes 
 I do 
 and most of the time I tear them out
 A lot of times uh you know if I got a chance to sit down at my typewriter I'll go ahead and type out recipes 
 but what I usually do is I'll try it out in the magazine first and without tearing it out and then give it a 
 Yeah 
 and then if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection 
 but uh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Sure 
 sure
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's what I just went through uh
 we just recently moved from Minnesota to Wisconsin
 I went through all this 
 I had this huge stack of HOUSE BEAUTIFUL
 I had COLONIAL TIMES 
 I had GOURMET
 yeah
 It was hard 
 but I ended up uh reducing them down to like fifteen magazines out of uh hundreds 
 And I just said Okay there's one picture in there that 
 it really doesn't you know 
 it's got to have more than that
 it's got to have some good ideas
 it's got to have everything 
 So I just kind of went through 
 and I find that most of the magazines I really like is around Christmas time because
