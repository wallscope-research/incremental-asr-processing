 Okay 
 what kind of books do you like to read for enjoyment
 Uh-huh 
 What kind of business is it
 Uh-huh
 Well that sounds fun 
 What kind of business is it
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Uh-huh
 Well that's interesting
 A what
 Oh really
 Well that sounds interesting 
 My mom always wants me to open a health food store
 but I'm not really into it 
 I don't know that much about it 
 so anyway but well that's interesting 
 personally I like mostly um 
 if I had a book of my choice I go to the library a lot 
 and it seems like I always I never go to the fiction section 
 that to me is just ridiculous 
 it's like life is to interesting to read fiction 
 but I always get books like um 
 I like to quilt 
 well I'm not into quilting 
 but I check a lot of books out to learn how 
 I just haven't done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do with a book 
 but I like to um can and do food preservation 
 and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff 
 and I like to check books out like that 
 and I always come away with 
 I'm a Christian 
 and I enjoy reading books about um 
 I have a real heart for people involved in cults
 and so I have a real you know heart for them 
 and I'm going to bring my Mormon neighbors some Amish bread today 
 and that's just where my heart is 
 so I read a lot of books on that 
 and you know Christian books written by people you know to help you out and stuff 
 and I read the Bible 
 I don't read the Bible as much as I should 
 but I think I would always think that no matter what I did 
 but I do enjoy reading that 
 and so pretty much we have different interests I think in reading 
 <> and I have a neighbor with a big motorbike
 and he likes to run down the street with it
 and you can probably hear him 
 But um I don't know 
 so Do you enjoy reading anything like that Um
 Uh-huh
 Thirty or younger Is that what you said
 Oh ten years younger 
 oh that's funny
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Yeah 
 Maureen Solomon I a friend of mine has a book by her right now called FOODS THAT HEAL
 They eat a lot of it 
 you know you can take your vitamins 
 and she was telling me to take zinc 
 so anyway I've been taking enough zinc you know to kill a horse probably
 I hope it doesn't hurt me 
 but anyway I did read one chapter of that 
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I haven't
 Uh-huh
 The quantities 
 and 
 What's the name of it again
 LIFE EXTENSIONS
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Really
 I know there's not any food that you can get 
 and it's grown on good soil hardly anymore 
 and I know my husband's uncle owns some acreage in Eastland Texas which is in West Texas 
 owns 
 and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly you know
 and uh we get black-eyed peas off of it and stuff 
 but I know that you know the further we go from Adam the worse the food is for you 
 but God still somehow makes us all be able to still live 
 I think it's a miracle we're all still alive after so many generations 
 well the last couple of processed foods 
 you know but I don't know 
 I like to 
 my 
 I like to be able to eat really healthy 
 you know and I guess I'm going to have to wait for the millennium I think though because I don't think we're going to restore the earth to 
 you know I think Jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be
 but uh in the meantime we pray over our food because I'm always looking down my plate 
 and I think man this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment
 but I do take some vitamins on the side 
 and I do like reading books like that I have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth 
 and we're going to restore the earth 
 I just don't see that 
 I think to think that is almost 
 it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the 
 you know what I'm saying
 It's 
 and I think God's in charge 
 and God's going to restore it when he wants to
 so sometimes I get bogged down you know in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking 
 but you know there's a balance in it sometimes I read stuff like that 
 and then I just chunk off like water off your back some of it 
 you know and try and do what I can do out of it that's practical
 but anyway uh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Because it's what
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 <> Uh-huh 
 Um
 Really
 Really 
 You know I bet that's why we have some friends that eat only 
 I just took this Amish bread out of the oven 
 man it's going to be good 
 I had a starter that friend of mine made 
 anyway uh I had a friend that read a book on that 
 and um I've 
 all my relatives my m- 
 you know you probably read BACK TO EDEN or something 
 I don't know 
 we read a lot 
 I know people have read all those books 
 but the um 
 they drilled a well I don't know how many feet 
 but it's three or four times deeper than it needed to be
 and so their water comes out 
 they live in Grand Prairie 
 but it's 
 they live kind of in the planes go right over from D F W 
 so it's not real developed 
 and so they have probably half an acre 
 and yeah 
 and they drilled this well 
 and the water comes out at thirty-two degrees
 so it's kinds of neat 
 Would that be healthier to do that to drill your own fresh water well like that
