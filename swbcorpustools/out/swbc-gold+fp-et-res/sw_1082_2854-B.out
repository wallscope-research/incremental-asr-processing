 Oh really
 Huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 what age child are you thinking in terms of
 No 
 for yourselves 
 Oh okay
 So you're starting from the baseline 
 I see 
 Right 
 I have one son
 Well he's now eighteen And you know has completed a couple of years of university
 I 
 right 
 and so that 
 but I was working full-time uh when he was born 
 But I was very lucky because I was a college professor
 And so I was able to you know 
 and it was walking distance from my apartment 
 So I went up there 
 and I sort of left him with a neighbor
 And I left him in a carry cot when he was very little 
 And I said you know he doesn't need anything except you know look at him if he cries 
 But you know don't pick him up and this sort of stuff 
 Because I was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half
 And I was able to you know get his schedule just uh cooperated
 And 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 I'm in Maryland
 but I was out of the country when uh my son was little 
 but the thing is if you have this flextime and that you might be able to do something similar to what I did Which is you know be there short times 
 and then later on when he was you know 
 this 
 we're talking about uh I went back to work or taught some classes like a week after he was born
 And so 
 Yeah 
 And so that's when I was saying you know don't pick him up and stuff 
 But then later what I did was I brought a woman into the house
 And she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff
 And then I also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing
 And you know in a sense she carried him around a lot too much Uh you know for my taste
 It was constantly no I don't want him to explore anything 
 uh he might hurt himself 
 I think it worked out very very well 
 Because what he learned to do by the time he was two or so he would sit next to the desk where I was grading papers or writing lesson plans
 And he had asked for a paper and you know sort of scribble 
 and then he realized that there were quiet times 
 and there were active times
 Oh
 Did you say Romania or Armenia
 Oh okay 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Oh good
 Oh great
 Oh that's silly 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh in my opinion it's even than 
 your kids need you 
 No 
 I was in the Middle East
 Right 
 right
 I 
 yeah 
 No 
 I was just going to say I guess uh my sensitivities are much more with the you know to be at home 
 Because actually I had my grandmother with me from the time she was ninety-two until she died at ninety-seven
 And that was recently after my son was going off 
 And yes 
 in a sense I went to work 
 and she was at home alone some of the time 
 but still you know it was much better than being shipped to a daycare center You know which is much my feelings on kids and the elderly 
 I think we're too much towards it's somebody problem you know 
 I want to work 
 Shove them in some school for twelve hours a day
 Yeah
 Right 
 right
 And that's sad Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 No 
 I think that certainly there is a role uh for this type of help
 and as long as one can supervise it and you know make it work into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or uh giving it you know the whole job to somebody else to take care of
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Actually there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood 
 Is 
 there are several mothers who stay home
 And they take you know 
 it's probably not completely legal 
 Uh I 
 maybe it's legal up to one or two additional kids
 But and they take care of another child 
 and I could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this
 And that's another possibility 
 and you know you might want to stay home one year 
 and some other lady might want to stay home for a few years 
 and 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 No 
 Well actually there was a daycare center uh where my son did go for a year 
 I think from when he was two to three
 But then he actually started kindergarten at age three
 And so and you know it wasn't like prekindergarten 
 it was real kindergarten
 Yeah 
 So he was ready to go to school at that point
 But yeah 
 they do have such facilities 
 But for the most part uh with the extended family you know you can usually find somebody Which is much like our neighbor you know sharing responsibility 
 and also there aren't that many women who work 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 No 
 no 
 And I didn't mean Israel 
 So you assumed right 
 Well no 
 because at first thought when you know I said that not many people work I'm thinking oh well she's going to you know because certainly in Israel the women do work
