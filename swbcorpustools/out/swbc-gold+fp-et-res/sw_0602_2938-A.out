 All right 
 Do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there
 The uh 
 Oh you mean for like smog and stuff
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh 
 What do you think of uh the greenhouse effect that's going on
 Yeah
 that's causing the hole in the ozone
 Uh-huh 
 it is scary though isn't it
 Right
 Well all right 
 North Carolina 
 That's up there by Kentucky isn't it
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Okay 
 Well Kentucky's next to Virginia I'm pretty sure 
 Well I'm from Kentucky 
 I should know 
 but I don't 
 I'm sorry 
 But Kentucky we use to have just real cold cold winters
 and we'd have three and four feet of snow 
 Course here in Texas they don't have snow 
 they don't know what snow is 
 They freak out when there's snow on the ground 
 Oh Amarillo
 Well that's close to here
 How long have you been in Raleigh
 Well how old are you
 Okay 
 Well we're the same age
 Yeah 
 I forget my age all the time 
 so that's okay 
 I think it's just something that goes with the territory
 But to me Texas see and Kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school 
 Okay
 In Texas I'm serious if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain I swear they close everything down 
 I just laugh
 I do 
 they get 
 and traffic slows down to nothing
 Oh well no northe- 
 I'm from the north 
 that's why I said in Kentucky we 
 I don't know 
 you just get used to the weather 
 and of course the people down in south they're not used to cold weather and stuff 
 and uh it just 
 I don't know 
 I just laugh 
 every time they have snow on the ground everything's closed up 
 And you know you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road 
 But uh 
 No 
 not really 
 not to see it 
 Now of course you know T I is here Oscar Mayer
 and there is a few factories 
 but I don't see much pollution going on
 Uh-huh
 Well see they have um what is it a test or something like that they call it
 And uh that's supposed to cut down on it 
 Yeah 
 school buses and the commercial buses 
 yeah
 Well they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is
 And uh it gets bad
 Uh-huh
 Well that's a good idea
 Well uh the you know pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes 
 When I was pregnant with my first little boy I had read it 
 because I was walking back and forth toc- 
 well not back and forth 
 I was walking home from uh the college I was going to in Kentucky 
 And I was having to walk along the highway 
 It was just one day a week 
 But it was in 
 I have no sense of smell 
 so I couldn't smell this 
 but it would make me sick 
 and I'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway
 But 
 yeah 
 it's 
 yeah 
 all the exhaust Uh 
 well that was four years ago too 
 it's probably a lot worse now
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Do you uh smoke
 yeah 
 it's kind of l- 
 Yeah 
 because you do smoke one a day
 Um Uh
 For the air pollution
 Huh 
 But they 
 I don't hear much about it down here 
 Course Texas we don't have a bunch of pollution 
 But too we've got that air coming in off the coast
 And you know it'd blow it up north
 So maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here
 But no 
 it would seem like it would be the same way on the California coastline wouldn't it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 But they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially
 I think they do that for most everybody
 especially it's usually for the young children and older old people 
 It is
 Oh
 Oh well this is pretty wooded area down here 
 so 
 in a lot of parts 
 yeah 
 I know Texas is supposed to be flat 
 but you know down by the Denison Dam there's a lot of uh 
 They do
 They live close then
 In Durant Oklahoma
 You go where Uh 
 you go to visit them
 Oh
 Yeah 
 well down by Lake Texoma there's a bunch of wooded area 
 This 
 but Kentucky's beautiful 
 They've got trees 
 and trees are supposed to you know purify 
 You know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff
 It's a philodendron
 It's supposed to filter the air for you in your home
 I had one 
 My husband bought it for me when my daughter was born four months ago
 Yeah 
 I do
 Yeah 
 I do
 Yeah 
 I did 
 I couldn't make myself quit
 I did cut down a lot 
 I've got one vice 
 and smoking is it
 I don't drink 
 and I try not to cuss 
 and I do very little 
 and smoking I got in the habit of it when I was about thirteen
 Yeah 
 we're down here at the Bible belt aren't we 
 Uh I wasn't saved until I got down here 
 and people down here are just 
 there's so many Christians 
 and it's so different from Kentucky 
 but 
 Um I worked at T I for a while 
 but then my brother-in-law works there 
 and he got me into it
 How'd you get into it
 Well it's fun 
 I like talking to new people
 And well a couple of times I've been interrupted by my little girl 
 I've had to hang up and stuff
 But I enjoy it 
 I talked to people from well what Carolina now up in uh Boston and New York 
 well Boston is New York isn't it 
 No
 Boston Massachusetts 
 But I've talked to people in New York 
 but I've talked to a lot of people in Texas 
 I guess it's because T Is down here
 With Boston I love their accent 
 I do 
 I love the Boston accent 
 I met a girl from Boston one time 
 My husband was in the service 
 so we went from Kentucky to Louisiana down here to Texas 
 and his family's down here 
 We're out of the service now
 Yeah 
 he got out of his unit right after Panama 
 he went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that
 And uh he
