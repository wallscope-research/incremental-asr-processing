 Okay 
 where are you from
 Oh okay
 because uh I talked to a professor in uh what was it North Carolina who got the T I system 
 and he gave to all his students 
 So my daughter's even talked to 
 and I've talked to several people from North Carolina 
 I was just curious
 Have you too 
 Yeah 
 I talked to the professor 
 and I asked him about it 
 and Oh he says I think I'm the guy that actually uh gave it to all my students
 So that's why so many people are from this college 
 Go ahead 
 you first Eve 
 Food
 Oh great
 Yeah 
 We have them too 
 and I'm trying to think which is the best uh that I prefer 
 Uh my wife uh doesn't like to have all that work on the very day that you're doing it uh 
 and we haven't catered out very much uh 
 I always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be 
 the man always gets that chore 
 and you have to make it perfect 
 Uh I've made shish kabob which I like 
 It's fairly easy and fast
 Uh where- 
 I guess I'm thinking of the easy thing to do for having uh uh dinner
 I do cook 
 but not 
 I'm mostly the easy cooker 
 You know the breakfasts and the steaks uh
 Although I would like to experiment with uh the meals my mother made you know So to speak 
 and I haven't gotten around to that yet uh
 Well she was Polish 
 and uh she would make very economical meals 
 We were very poor
 Different rice and ham and things that uh 
 she would throw things together and galunkies and all that 
 And uh I would like to try that one day 
 And she would make spaghetti with pork chops and special meat balls and everything 
 And my wife of course thinks I'm crazy which I may be too 
 but 
 Yeah
 But dinner parties are a lot of work uh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well that 
 shish kabob is uh just because it only takes a few minutes to cook you know
 you get it ready 
 you have to do a lot of work beforehand I agree and buy special stuff 
 But uh so far as getting out there and putting it on it only takes a few minutes uh
 But anyway I'm thinking of the easy way rather than my guests I guess 
 but uh 
 Right 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Oh yeah
 Right
 You'd get the odor of it yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yes
 Oh great 
 Oh yes 
 we probably ought to try this 
 But it probably will never taste as good as we remembered
 I guess it gets better and better as we remember it back as we get older you know 
 But we probably should try it uh to do that 
 The recipes are really interesting you know 
 We're probably going to lose them 
 and we'll probably forget all about them you know
 Since we're trying to make everything so sim- 
 here I am talk about trying to make everything easy you know
 I uh 
 you talked about Thanksgiving there are interesting meals at different times 
 Uh something s- 
 my wife's from Texas 
 so uh I remember we were first married 
 and we were living in New Jersey 
 And uh we were going over to my mother's house for Christmas you know to have a meal
 And we were on the way over 
 we were just married that very year 
 and she said Oh I'm looking forward to a nice turkey 
 I said Turkey
 I said We don't have turkey at Christmas 
 I said We only have turkey on Thanksgiving 
 I said We're going to have a ham
 She said What
 I said Yeah 
 I said No turkey is only for Thanksgiving 
 And because she had turkey a lot you know
 And uh that was surprising in the east uh 
 we always had ham you know
 A- 
 and that's one thing als- 
 that's another recipe I guess we could talk about 
 Now the hams just kind of you know go take it out of a can or uh uh a package sliced uh 
 the cans were cooked for hours and hours and were just wonderful you know
 I'd like to try that too
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 I saw them
 That's good 
 No 
 I know about Sam's 
 My wife I think goes 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Oh I haven't heard of that yeah
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 I'll have to ask her about that Uh because we have a delivery guy that comes around that sells 
 I'm trying to think of his name of it 
 Uh uh I don't know uh 
 I see a can here a box here of Gourmet Choice 
 Uh he delivers uh 
 What is the name of this thing 
 I got a box distributor marked on it 
 it doesn't say <> Gourmet Choices 
 But he 
 but it's a company that has uh you know a truck that comes around 
 and they recently had hams 
 They have steaks and uh actually pirogies and all that stuff that uh 
 I wish I could tell you the name of the company 
 but I don't know what it is 
 But uh they recently had a ham that was supposed to be 
 it was boneless
 and we tried it 
 It was real nice 
 and it was fully cooked and everything 
 We had it for breakfast a long time 
 It was really great
 Yeah
 I would like to try the old recipe though of cooking it 
 and I keep saying this uh to do the different things that we did 
 But I would like to put one in the oven you know the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours and see if 
 because I don't think in my married life which is uh twenty-six years now we've never done that you know
 And I remember that when I was a kid uh to have the ham cooking Uh rather than that we just 
 ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally you know
 And that's it you know
 In the old days hams were the meal 
 and I don't think we really have it as a main meal
 Right
 That's an interesting point 
 how have you changed your meals now 
 Have you 
 into that uh 
 looking at those things
 Uh-huh 
 Parents that's unusual
 Oh yeah
 That's amazing
 Yeah
 Well that's amazing
 they'd go 
 that they have started 
 Usually it's the younger people doing it 
 Yeah
 I 
 uh my wife's mother is the only grandparent left 
 and uh she has high cholesterol 
 Of course I have too but not like hers
 And I always get after her about salt and everything else 
 And she just will she's going to eat the same way she ate you know her whole life 
 And she just tells more or less tells me to shut up you know
 And uh I like to 
 I'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way
 Uh
 uh it's not the 
 I listen to uh Larry Newarth on the weekend 
 He's a fitness expert 
 and uh he talks about you know the chicken and the rice and everything else 
 and uh throwing away peanut butter and all you know the things not to eat you know ever 
 I think the peanut butter and mayonnaise he would throw away for ever 
 And then he's got me into making eggs without the yolk
 You know try that sometime
 My wife says she can't stand it 
 But uh when I make scrambled eggs now talking about a recipe 
 I 
 say if I have four eggs not for me 
 but if I'm making four eggs uh even for my daughter I'll take out all the yolks but one
 and it's fine 
 you don't miss it uh
 In fact when I make eggs for myself if I fry them throw them in there I will almost hard fry them so I can not eat the yolk at all
 And you don't really miss it 
 You get the flavor of the yolk 
 but uh you don't eat it at all you know 
 You don't 
 they're hard 
 You get like uh a bite at the most 
 And so uh for cholesterol I'm trying that 
 And it has worked 
 My cholesterol gone down twenty points 
 So although 
 I haven't gotten on the butter or not cholesterol + ] margarine and all that 
 I don't know whether any of that is true you know <> Whether the margarines or butter
