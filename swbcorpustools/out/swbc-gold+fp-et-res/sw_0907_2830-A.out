 
 Yeah 
 I've been sitting here alternately reading and watching television 
 he was waiting for what again
 That's what this was 
 yeah 
 well let me go a head and push one 
 okay
 Okay 
 Well basically I like comedy shows Uh MURPHY BROWN uh DESIGNING WOMEN 
 Yeah 
 what do you like
 Oh okay 
 That's okay 
 we'll been married eleven years 
 and um we went through that after about five years of marriage 
 my old T V that I had from college when we got married finally went out 
 and we made it almost about eighteen months without a television
 Yeah 
 but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize um gee I needed that you know 
 and then you get to remote control the stereo phonic whatever all of those things
 oh yeah 
 and then you never use the V C R 
 and now we have two of them 
 and now it's like we're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we wouldn't use it 
 Yeah 
 it's cause your never home you know 
 you're working 
 you're at school
 Well I don't know T V shows 
 what can I tell you um 
 basically junk that's on television 
 That's my opinion 
 yeah 
 um I like things like I just mentioned 
 have you ever seen MURPHY BROWN or anything like that
 You don't think so 
 oh that's the one with Candice Bergen in it um
 Yeah 
 that would do it
 Right 
 nobody does yeah then 
 uh-huh
 I know
 And the uh 
 well I don't 
 you're probably at least ten years younger then I am 
 but I could tell you in school that uh the only thing that ever saw in the dorm was uh the one soap opera ALL MY CHILDREN
 And until then I never paid attention to soap operas
 And to this day twenty years later I'm in my thirties 
 I'm not that old 
 but I'm going jeez I can't believe that thing's still on television 
 Yeah 
 they you know 
 about the only other kinds of things I like um 
 I like to watch a lot of news um 
 don't you miss that with not having a television so far
 How long has it been since you've had one
 Oh my God 
 Yeah 
 you've got about another six months 
 and then you'll get one 
 By then 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 my husband is an only child too 
 and he did miss it 
 that's kind of why we got back after eighteen months
 and I'm trying to think about the only other show I watch
 Yeah
 I like COSBY 
 L A LAW is probably 
 I've seen CHEERS 
 more then that I hate to admit 
 but uh 
 CHEERS 
 Yeah 
 I thought it was good 
 I've actually been to that bar in Boston 
 you know it's a pretty funny show
 Yeah
 It's just a you know over priced downtown Boston yuppie you know tourist attraction 
 I'm trying to think what else is on television 
 I know it's like 
 Yeah 
 who didn't 
 Isn't that sad
 Uh-huh 
 Oh no actually I like pro basket ball as opposed to 
 I watch pro football 
 but I like the N B A play-offs back when like the Pistons were in them 
 and now 
 where are you calling from
 Sherman Texas oh
 I'm in Dallas 
 I was just saying where am I calling you from you know 
 well then I don't know if you like the Mavericks or not 
 they haven't been that good this year 
 Um we're supposed to talk about television 
 let's see 
 you don't have a T V
 Yeah 
 I'm talking to you from Dallas 
 uh-huh
 My voice you mean
 Oh no 
 that's just because I've moved around 
 and uh I'm originally from Pennsylvania 
 so 
 Uh actually I'm a big Chicago Bears' fan
 Real big 
 and uh um I always watch them no matter who's on 
 of course you like them too right
 Do you
 Oh okay
 Yeah 
 there you go 
 and um I'm trying to think what else I like to watch on television sports wise 
 I like tennis 
 so I haven't played in years 
 but um I just like to watch you know two players really go at it
 It gets boring after a while 
 but I don't 
 go ahead
 OPRAH 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 on the tracks 
 yeah 
 is sh- 
 Maybe cause she got chubby again or something
 was her show big when you where in school since you haven't been out that long
 Was her show big when you where in college since you haven't been that long
 Was it 
 Yeah 
 I saw reruns of it
 I saw tapes of her 
 yeah 
 Gee I know 
 isn't that terrible
 I know 
 I guess with that money who cares 
 I don't know
 Let's see what else is on television 
 Oh if you don't have a V C R we just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it
 Yeah 
 cause you know if you like movies like we do you do it once in awhile 
 and then you know you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it 
 and then it usually comes on television within two years You know 
 Yeah 
 really that's television 
 I don't know 
 in general on this project we're suppose to talk about 
 so 
 That's okay
 don't 
 I always 
 Yeah 
 Oh that's okay 
 I had one lady one time 
 they called in 
 I just signed up 
 my husband had been on this project um 
 and she called in 
 and we don't have children and it was all about um sending your kids to college and why you would advise them 
 And she was from Boston 
 and I shouldn't talk about this but she was pretend she was a television show 
 and she was very snooty 
 and uh her kids were going to places like Amherst and B U 
 and I said I didn't know what that was 
 she went oh 
 and I thought um 
 so I know
 it's like don't worry about it 
 you know everybody's at least seen television During the war did you laugh when they had that man on 
 uh what was his name Wolf Blitzer
 That guy that was a reporter for C N N
 His name is Wolf Blitzer 
 Did you see him when he was doing the coverage of the Gulf
 Uh no 
 that was the other guy from C B S 
 oh what was his name uh
 I can't remember his name
 Yeah 
 but just th- 
 they made jokes about him like on the CARSON SHOW and all of that
 Jay Leno
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 he's funny
 Yeah 
 SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE has changed a lot if you haven't seen it in about a year
 I haven't seen it in a couple of months 
 but 
 Uh yeah 
 actually I think it has 
 they finally like 
 and some of those people 
 they really have funny characters on there
 Yeah 
 they have one character on there 
 they just call it Pat 
 and you don't know if it's a man or a woman 
 And they say well they're trying to deduce what he or she is
 so to see if it's a female they say well do you carry a purse 
 and Pat says no 
 I carry a fanny pack 
 So you still don't know because a fanny pack is man 
 or now days you know 
 Yeah 
 it's weird 
 Yeah 
 yeah it is pretty funny 
 they do some crazy things
 Yeah 
 WAYNE'S WORLD hey man 
 And what's that other one where they do the um skits 
 well you've must have seen it recently
 You probably have some friends that have television 
 I said you probably have some friends that have television 
 You know you're not totally out of the loop
 yeah
 Yeah 
 you can do without one 
 but after awhile it will start um you know 
 you just kind of all of sudden 
 cause you're going well jeez 
 you hear about something that somebody else talked about
 and you just end up doing it 
 but if you haven't been married that long you know you're doing other things 
 Is that on tape 
 there you go 
 yeah
 Oh my 
 what else is on 
 I don't know 
 what did they watch in college when you where in 
 where did you go to school
 Oh that's a good school
 Yeah 
 I know about that 
 They don't have a southern accent up there though
 You must be native Texan
 Well your from Indiana yeah
 *[[your should be you're]] Oh real southern 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Deep one you have a deep one 
 yeah 
 It is um 
 at Purdue 
 I went to high school in Chicago I'm trying to think what Purdue kids watch
 Uh-huh 
 Okay
 I think other then accept on a commercial or on news coverage or something like entertainment tonight I've never seen M T V
 That's kind of what I've heard 
 I mean that's 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 No 
 we don't 
 and I don't even have cable 
 I don't think it's worth ten to thirty bucks a month to pay somebody uh to you know give me a hundred and fifty um channel access to something I'm never going to 
 my neighbor her husband sits in front of the television all of time 
 and they've only been married five years have a cute one year old kids 
 I swear to God he works from eight
