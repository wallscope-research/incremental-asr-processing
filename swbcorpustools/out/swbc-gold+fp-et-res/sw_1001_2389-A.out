 Okay 
 Oh I think that a woman's role has come a long way 
 We have gone more into the business aspect like I say of I don't know working more 
 and I think we've even gone into more the labor aspect of it also With the pay and everything you know
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And a lot of times you can't 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 my mom she's a housewife 
 and well there is twelve kids in my family 
 so my mom never could really work you know because she was kind of pregnant from day one 
 She never really had a chance to work
 She worked before she got married 
 but uh uh she doesn't believe in 
 she's very old fashioned 
 She doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and also like my mom thinks 
 she's kind of right with it 
 when both partners of the marriage work she feels that that's taking more away 
 that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work You know like for the men that don't have jobs 
 you know she feels if there is women out there just because they want to do it she said you know they could stay at home
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 What do you think about that 
 do you think that {F uh 
 } what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Or they won't be as good as they could be
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Exactly
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh my
 Bless you 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I agree
 Uh-huh
 And they just enjoyed the income the extra 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Exactly
 Oh I know 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Exactly
 Uh-huh
 See yeah 
 see now my parents there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college
 And so far there is only two of us that have gone 
 and my older brother has paid his entire way 
 and I'm on my 
 I have six weeks left 
 and you know I'll graduate 
 and I paid my entire way 
 and that's the way it'll go down the line 
 and like I don't have a car because I'm paying for college 
 and if I want a car 
 my parents always said if we wanted a car we paid for the car and we paid for our own insurance 
 and I think that's right 
 because 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Like I've had my you know 
 like I know kids up here that have their own cars 
 and money is just given to them 
 like they still get their allowance 
 they are twenty years old and they still get an allowance 
 Well I have held a summer job you know since you know I was in the eleventh grade 
 and I have had to take care of my own money 
 have my own checking account 
 I pay for my own life insurance 
 and I know a lot of kids that don't even know 
 I tell them I pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor you know
 Well if they do they don't know it you know 
 Uh-huh
 Oh I know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh
 Actually I think abortion is going to take a turn where there is not going to be as many 
 because I think contraceptives are going to be more popular 
 I realize that they are popular now 
 but I think I really think people are going to start using more contraceptives 
 and with the abortion I don't think there is going to be as many abortions but I don't know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion
 I think it will be freedom of choice
 Uh-huh
 Exactly yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics I think it will definitely be freedom of choice Uh-huh
 I do 
 I'm Catholic 
 and we are not supposed to you know say that that's okay but I really feel that it's freedom of choice
 I do
 Uh-huh
 And different circumstances call for different things
