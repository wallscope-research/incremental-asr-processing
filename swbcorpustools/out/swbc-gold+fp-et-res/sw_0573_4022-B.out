 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it kind of seems to me that everyone's offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when it's just such a bad time for it
 Yeah 
 The ninety-seven cents a week 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 mostly it's not actually a cut 
 it's just a cut in the amount withheld you know
 Um yeah 
 I don't see this changing my lifestyle a whole lot
 Huh-uh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 you know in retrospect um was it Mondale or Dukakis that said you know I'll tell you right now I'm going to raise taxes
 It was Dukakis 
 yeah
 I have a lot of respect for him 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Oh yeah 
 Yeah 
 it's 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 I think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where 
 it would help unemployment greatly
 And it 
 Yeah 
 infra structure is in 
 we have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty years in the cold war
 Uh-huh 
 Um yeah 
 I agree totally 
 Um it just seems you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen 
 Um I'm in college right now 
 and 
 Oh really 
 where do you go
 Right 
 I go to Georgia Tech um 
 And in 
 what 
 I had you know the required political science class a couple of years ago 
 And one of the things we discussed was you know how the budget situation just got so out of hand
 And essentially what happened was 
 I think it was like in the um tax year of eighty-one um 
 Ronald Reagan basically said you know I'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and created this ludicrous budget that he knew um that the Congress would not in their right mind pass
 and the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war you know you know bye-bye removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and you know created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit
 And you just 
 it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well yeah 
 um what really bothers me is it just seems like if anyone were to say you know well I'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're going to have to do some unpopular things he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected
 it's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where people just want to have you know whatever will make them feel good right now you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 It 
 I don't know 
 I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week
 I just don't think it was a well thought out incentive
