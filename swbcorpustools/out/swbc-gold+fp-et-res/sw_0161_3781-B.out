 Well I suppose we both have credit cards
 Yeah
 Well I do use them
 Uh I have a few favorites that I use more than others 
 and uh I try to keep my balances fairly reasonable 
 I could probably pay them off any month if I wanted to
 Uh but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when you start using more than a few
 and uh they all can build up
 Uh I think they're handy 
 I just get uh 
 I don't carry a lot of cash with me
 and uh I hate writing checks when you go shopping
 Well do you use credit cards
 Uh-huh
 Grandmother 
 huh
 Uh-huh
 That's good
 Oh That's wonderful
 Well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you're savings is bringing 
 It's really I guess ridiculous to let them keep building
 But I know some people can get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand
 Uh-huh
 Uh- yeah
 Well that's good 
 right now I'm kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate
 It seems that some of them have gotten higher
 and uh I saw on T V they had a program on uh credit cards 
 and they're supposed to 
 I don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country 
 And I didn't write it down at the time 
 and then I went and looked to see what my visa was 
 and I think it's eighteen percent or something
 so think I want to find something that has a lower rate
 No 
 I haven't
 Is that the one from Sears
 Okay
 Okay 
 Uh-huh
 Oh they give you money back for using your credit card
 Oh
 I didn't know that
 Um Well you know Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards
 I worked at Sears for over ten years 
 and uh it was only a Sears card that they would take until I guess they decided to join the club and come up with another credit card that was accepted 
 so you know now they'll take the Discover 
 but I still don't know if Sears will take Visa or Mastercard
 But uh I never did apply for a Discover card 
 I just figure with the Visa and American Express I probably have an 
 I can do enough damage with those two
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I've got some that you know I haven't even used at all uh past few years 
 I probably wouldn't be able to use them
 But uh I do like my Dillard's 
 I have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop
 And I do use Dillard's probably more than any of the other department stores
 But 
 Well 
 No 
 not too much more about credit cards 
 Okay 
 well 
 Good talking to you Beth
 Good luck
 You too
 Bye
