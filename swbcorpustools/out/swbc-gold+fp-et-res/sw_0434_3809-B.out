 That 
 Right 
 Well they've entered the work force more uh you know since World War Two is when they started
 And uh I think that that is you know very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women
 Right
 Yeah 
 the 
 you see more of them uh leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too
 You know I have a club that I belong to on Tuesday that 
 you know one of the girls travels quite extensively 
 and she says well my children have two parents 
 You know why not 
 So I think that's a change 
 and I think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing
 Right
 No
 that I think will change in the near future also
 It's been changing 
 it's been evolving 
 but there's still an inequality in the work forces or jobs 
 It's you know 
 And you hear some people say you know 
 well he's a man 
 he needs that salary
 Right
 And going 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah 
 I think it will be 
 I well 
 another thing I read too the other day 
 this is not just for working women 
 but how much they're out there I guess is 
 the car designers uh are starting to design cars with women in mind Uh because in the past the male bought the cars 
 but now they're showing that fifty-five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases And that they are looking for uh different things in the car 
 The man is looking in the engine 
 and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel Uh can her makeup come off the upholstery 
 And if they're out there buying that many cars then there's that many out that are self sufficient and you know mobile and working
 Right
 Yeah 
 we all do
 I just happen to be off today
 I work too
 I'm a nurse
 And I work at Medical Treatment Center uh which is at uh Jupiter and Arapaho
 No
 I don't know 
 I'm kind of out of things
 You've come a long way baby
 Right
