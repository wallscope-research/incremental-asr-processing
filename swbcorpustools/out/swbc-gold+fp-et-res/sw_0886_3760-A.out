 Okay uh I guess we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time
 Uh I basically read books
 It is 
 I do 
 Sometimes when everybody's gone to bed my kids are in bed and my husband in bed 
 so I will just stay up and finish a book that I am 
 I have about three books that I am going on 
 And I will work on one for a little bit you know and then the next one 
 But that's just kind of 
 Not always 
 just sometimes
 Uh just really different ones 
 Uh I have one that I was reading on uh raising your children and then another one on an autobiography and another one on uh uh uh like a crime story 
 A true crime story
 Yeah 
 But this 
 it was a true one 
 It was just a little different though 
 Reading that one last night
 Yeah 
 like my husband
 Yeah 
 You must uh work for T I
 Yeah 
 my husband does too
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 really
 Oh really
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 What kinds of things do you fix
 Oh 
 And you have a shop
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you can fix just about everything and anything
 Well that is great
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 That is pretty much like my husband 
 he is pretty uh mobile in that area too 
 he works on the cars 
 He rarely takes them in
 and uh he works on irons and all T Vs and stuff too 
 We rarely have to take those things in too
 Oh yeah 
 Yeah 
 definitely
 Uh Not really 
 during Christmas I work on you know like uh holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things
 but uh not really 
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh I belong to this organization uh if you have preschool children
 and uh every once and a while they will have a craft uh section for the moms
 and those are really neat 
 and we learn to do the uh transfer pictures on the sweatshirts transfer photos
 and uh those are really neat 
 So we learn different crafts like that uh 
 Yeah
 No 
 I cook dinner 
 I don't consider it a hobby 
 But uh you know I 
 no 
 I am not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately
 I like to bake off and on 
 And usually once a week I will bake something 
 but it's not anything elaborate you know 
 At least I don't think it is
 So 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 Well good 
 You have a computer at home
 Oh good 
 Yeah
 Oh really 
 Wow 
 Then you are busy 
 Uh-huh 
 that is very good
 Well you know one of the books that I was reading 
 and I stopped because it was so 
 it's 
 the book is so detailed
 and you have to 
 sometimes I have to go back and read the page over again cause I didn't quite get it all 
 And uh it is so detailed
