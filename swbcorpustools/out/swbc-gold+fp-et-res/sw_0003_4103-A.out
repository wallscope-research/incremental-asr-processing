 Uh the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and monthly budget 
 The only thing I do now is uh put the data into Quicken 
 I don't know if you are familiar with that
 Uh-huh
 Um I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then well uh uh not bother to total it
 and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic 
 So it really helps with that
 Uh-huh
 Well actually we haven't had to Uh until just recently 
 I guess we've got a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way 
 so we needed to start doing more of that just for uh you know saving for college and things like that 
 We try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Um Sounds good 
 Yeah 
 I guess we're just at the point uh 
 my wife worked until we had a family 
 and then you know now we're just going on the one income 
 so it's a lot more interesting trying to uh 
 find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to uh do it 
 You know kind of enforce the savings
 But uh it will be interesting to see 
 Um
 Um
 That sounds good 
 But uh uh I was just curious what uh part of the country 
 Oh okay
 Uh Cincinnati actually 
 I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that 
 I don't know how many people are uh getting involved in this 
 but uh well that's interesting 
 uh uh actually uh I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading TELECOM DIGEST 
 or was there another
 Oh okay 
 Yeah 
 that is how I got it as well 
 but uh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It would be interesting to see how the data base 
 so well I guess we're talking about the experiment
 Uh probably need to try to get back on the topic 
 but uh it's hard to talk about finances without getting to uh dollar figures I guess you know 
 we could talk about some of the long range goals 
 and 
 Uh well I think either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point
 uh I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that 
 It seems like every year my employer just gives back you know a little bit your tuition reimbursement
 they use to reimburse one hundred percent 
 and uh now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class 
 and uh it's a real shame from what we had before uh because we're
