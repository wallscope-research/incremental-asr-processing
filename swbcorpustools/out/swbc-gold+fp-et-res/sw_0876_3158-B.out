 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh wow 
 that's the next project that I'd like to learn to do 
 I do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery 
 and I'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch 
 I was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt
 It gets boring
 Uh-huh
 Well it reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging I think
 But I do a lot of it in the car 
 We 
 Yeah 
 we commute from Plano to Dallas
 so I have nearly an hour both ways that I can really get a lot of work done 
 and I found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car
 I don't know that I could even think about quilting 
 You have to have a pretty good frame don't you to do any kind of quilting work
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh I bet
 But it's such a lost art
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 I bet
 There's so many things I wish I had learned to do with my mother 
 She had crocheted a full bedspread 
 It's kind of a hobnail looking thing 
 And when I look at it now she's been dead for a long time I think oh why didn't I learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that people just don't know how to do
 No
 Uh-huh 
 Haven't tried that either
 I want to learn to crochet 
 I 
 Really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 It's funny when you were talking about sewing I love to do anything by hand with a needle
 But I'm totally intimidated if I sit down at a sewing machine 
 I never learned 
 and I get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me
 But I just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well it's hard to find the time 
 I wouldn't if I didn't have this car time ability probably because at night if I sit down I'm doing something with the kids or just not sitting down at all 
 Uh-huh
 Well it 
 I'm at the age where bifocals or trifocals would be necessary 
 It's so I find myself putting glasses on to watch T V and then taking them off to do needlework 
 and I get frustrated doing that 
 so Just give it up
 Ooh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I'm the same way 
 If I see something I can copy it 
 but I certainly can't create 
 I admire people that have that in their minds already
 Uh-huh
 Well sometimes even with that I think you have to have some
