 I'm Jay in Dallas
 That keeps you plenty of exercise 
 Well uh I have 
 I walked and run um almost every morning 
 I've sort of stopped here with the weather change 
 but uh it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning
 Oh that would 
 that's fantastic exercise
 Um
 All right
 I'd rather get a bicycle 
 but I had an exercise bike in the house but didn't seem to use it enough 
 so somebody sold it in a garage sale 
 uh but I'd like to get a bike and just uh do biking outside
 Yeah
 It keeps going 
 because I'm fifty-five 
 and uh it just gets worse 
 You still want to eat 
 uh but you just 
 I think you feel better too if you get on some program like that 
 but uh 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh
 I know some of it is so tough
 and uh especially when somebody's uh planning lunch for you and they know what's good for you 
 I think when we do it ourselves 
 we take the easy way sometimes
 So 
 So anyway 
 thank you for calling
 All right
 Bye-bye
