 Uh-huh 
 Well I'll tell you I used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on than I do now
 uh I do the easy stuff now 
 I change oil 
 uh and then what some people would consider a little more difficult I'll change spark plugs 
 and I'll change you know points and you know do air filters that kind of stuff
 But uh I can't do as much as I used to 
 um I used to do a whole lot more but not any more 
 they're just too weird to work on now
 Well that's part of it
 yeah 
 part of it is like you said I don't have time
 Uh-huh
 Well um on this car I've got now no 
 but I had a van before 
 and it was only two years old 
 and it had transmission go out on it
 But fortunately that was covered under the warranty
 Um
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 sometimes it makes you wonder
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Did you take it to a dealership
 Uh-huh
 Oh I see
 Uh-huh
 Oh I see
 Right
 Oh gosh
 It's going to run for a while yet
 Uh I work for T I
 I work in the networking area
 Do you work for T I
 No 
 okay
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah

 Oh yeah 
 I'm planning on it 
 Oh it can't be any worse than last year 
 that's for sure
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 that's true
 Yeah 
 I'm going to try and plan on it
 All right well I enjoyed the conversation
 All right thank you 
 Bye-bye
