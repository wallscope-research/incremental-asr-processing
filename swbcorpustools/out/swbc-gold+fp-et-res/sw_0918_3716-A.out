 We could talk about my favorite subject 
 Food 
 Uh I don't cook a lot actually 
 I have just started baking 
 so uh I am kind of interested in cakes and uh muffins and stuff like that 
 but I can't seem to get them exactly right 
 So I am just trying to perfect some things
 I tried to make an applesauce cake Which I will never ever try to make again
 It was horrible 
 I don't know if the cake was horrible or if I made it horrible
 Uh
 Oh 
 Hey 
 Uh-huh
 Uh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 They request it 
 I have not gotten any requests yet 
 Last year I had a Christmas party at uh my office 
 and I uh made the tuna fish sandwiches 
 And uh I think everyone knows how to make tuna fish 
 so I thought that would be easy for me to make 
 and I can not go wrong with that 
 and so I made it 
 and uh I used celery seed in my 
 Do you use celery seed in your tuna fish
 And I just thought it was so strange 
 because I thought that that was what celery seed was for 
 Was for tuna fish 
 but everyone really really loved the tuna fish 
 and they just couldn't get over the fact that I used celery in it 
 and it just surprised me 
 Celery and onion and 
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 Yeah
 Just like uh really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed 
 and I use like uh Miracle Whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise because I really don't like the Helman's Mayonnaise 
 But if you use salad dressing with uh you know kind of I guess a tart taste Then it comes out real good 
 But uh it was the first time I have ever found out that nobody else used celery seed 
 I feel so silly 
 but 
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 I would put that too 
 I just did not have those things
 Like I don't think I had eggs that night or something 
 but I would have put eggs 
 I would have put eggs in there also
 Uh strange
 Celery seed
 Do you use a regular mayonnaise or The Miracle Whip 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I do that also
 Just to put a little zing in it
 Uh-huh
 <> I love barbecue 
 Anything barbecued I will eat
 Uh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I like to make that too 
 I make that once in a while
 It is not really once you have all the ingredients
 it is just the layering really And not breaking uh the uh pasta
 That is the hardest part probably
 But uh 
 Uh
 Do you make cheesecake
 Uh-huh
 Uh
 Uh-huh
 Uh 
 And just put the strawberries
