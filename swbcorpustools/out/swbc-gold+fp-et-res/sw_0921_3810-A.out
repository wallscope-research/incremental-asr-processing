 Why don't you tell me about your choir
 Uh-huh
 Great
 Uh I play the piano
 and uh I have a four year old who has started to play the piano 
 He does that uh musically listens 
 and then he can play which is kind of interesting
 I think it's because he's always heard music in our home since he was a baby
 Uh my husband and my other son who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here in the community at Music Man
 Yeah 
 and that's lots of fun
 Uh basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions 
 It was the Plano Repertory Theatre
 And so they went and tried out 
 and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man 
 and my son played one of the children in a band
 So yeah 
 it was really fun 
 and uh my son plays the clarinet in his band at school 
 and my daughter takes piano lessons too
 But uh we just really like music 
 I especially like it as an outlet when the T V goes off 
 we get the T V off and just have some nice quiet music
 Uh-huh
 Uh I have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki Which is an auditory type learning experience 
 You listen to the music and then learn to play it by hearing the intervals and things like that
 I teach uh like what is traditionally taught you know 
 you look at the note on the page 
 and you play what's on the piano 
 but he can't learn like that 
 He's a delayed child 
 I guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things
 uh so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it uh with his right hand 
 we went wow
 we better have him s- do something You know educationally
 So that was really fun
 My husband and I love to go to the musicals downtown though
 So my husband and I love to go to the musicals when they come into town into Dallas
 Um
 Oh I think that's great
 That's really hard I think especially if you start them 
 and then they get pretty good 
 and then they get close ten you know eleven or something 
 they go I don't want to do this anymore 
 and you're like God I really want you to do it
 You know
 So sometimes it's hard to know exactly when 
 but I don't know 
 if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it
 Uh-huh
 That's like me
 Well it can get expensive
 that's for sure
 my friend is very generous in letting us have my children uh do the Suzuki method without paying a lot out
 Yeah 
 so it's been good for our family
 I don't have any Suzuki students Uh
 Something happening to me at Christmas time that verified to me that I will al-
