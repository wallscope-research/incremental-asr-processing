 Yeah
 All right 
 Yeah 
 I'm kind of into it 
 I'm uh kind of a sailor
 I'm up in Minneapolis now 
 but I was in Florida 
 so uh yeah 
 I was kind of into it for a while there
 Yeah 
 for the most part 
 Yeah
 I had a little sail
 No 
 What part of Texas you from
 Okay 
 whereabouts is that
 Okay 
 all right
 Is that right
 Wow 
 that's pretty wild
 Okay 
 so you got some lakes around you can do that on
 You do skiing and stuff 
 or 
 Yeah 
 All right
 Yeah
 All right
 Yeah 
 that sounds good 
 Yeah 
 uh our 
 the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now
 Yeah
 not too many no 
 But uh no 
 I just got back from a weekend 
 We went and uh had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing 
 It was pretty nice 
 but uh no uh I had a boat last summer that I took out a catamaran that I did a lot of sailing on and stuff
 That's a lot of fun 
 but uh my parents are pretty big sailors too 
 they're kind of into it
 Oh yeah 
 I guess uh fishing's a pretty big thing huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 All right 
 So where about in Texas is that 
 Is that centrally located 
 or 
 Uh no 
 what major city is nearby
 Okay 
 and that's south or north of there or something
 Yeah 
 Okay
 Oh okay 
 all right 
 Well that sounds pretty good 
 Does uh 
 I guess the weather 
 does that stay pretty constant there 
 or 
 Yeah
 Okay 
 well that's pretty temperate 
 Yeah 
 that's not too bad 
 But uh yeah 
 have you done uh any other boating then 
 or 
 Yeah
 Oh that's great 
 Yeah 
 I 
 Oh that's fantastic 
 Yeah 
 I used to uh kind of be that way myself when I lived in uh north western Florida in the panhandle 
 I used to sail about every day 
 I'd go to work 
 Yeah 
 it's a lot of fun 
 It's uh 
 especially if you get a pretty fast boat 
 like those catamarans are pretty fast
 You can actually 
 Well actually I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life 
 Uh my family's pretty into it
 and uh I took sailing lessons when I was about six 
 and then uh 
 Yeah 
 it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know uh just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and the physics behind it
 So it's not too bad 
 it's pretty easy to get the hang of I think 
 and uh generally everybody I've known has kind of gotten into it 
 but some people are more motorboaters you know which is fine
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 lot of people don't see the excitement in sailing 
 but then again they may never have tried anything like uh catamaran
 and uh that's when you really start getting into speed You know 
 some catamarans you can actually pull people behind the skiers 
 they get so fast you know
 Yeah 
 they get pretty quick 
 but 
 uh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I haven't personally done that 
 but uh the races 
 I work with a guy right now that uh races catamarans in the summertime
 and uh he's pretty gassed about it 
 He's got a good uh 
 Well uh he's from Detroit
 so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes I think and does his sailing Uh 
 for me I go back to Orlando uh in about a month and so down there basically just go to the coast 
 We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast 
 and there's a lot of places there you can go you know 
 uh so that's a good thing
 yeah so what do you do for a job
 Oh really
 Okay 
 is that for T I 
 or 
 Okay 
 Are they primarily electronic then
 Okay
 Well that 
 Right
 Oh okay
 Great 
 Yeah 
 how do you like it down there in Texas
 Yeah
 Oh no doubt
 Okay 
 I've never been to Texas 
 I've been to Oklahoma 
 but uh that's about as far as 
 Yeah 
 Okay 
 well that's good because I didn't like Oklahoma that well
