 Oh yeah 
 Ever since I was a young and uh used to watch the old uh Apollo missions going off in uh classroom T Vs
 Uh I suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching those go off
 Uh very exciting
 The uh uh 
 I've always uh wanted very much uh to uh be somehow involved in all that And uh to uh meet and to see it actually happen 
 Of course I've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday
 But uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately
 Uh computer programmer 
 Unfortunately that can be done from the ground 
 Yeah 
 Made the wrong career choice to get up into space 
 The uh uh 
 I used to think when I was younger that uh by this time we'd have lots more stuff in space than we do now
 Uh frustrating at times
 I don't know what you think about all that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 Well the uh uh 
 I've always uh felt that uh uh one of the long-term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up
 Uh because that's a uh you know singularly renewable resource that doesn't require uh uh any particularly nasty environment impact
 And you can just get as much power as you need up there
 It's just a matter of how big you build it
 Uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that I think we should be doing 
 So the side effects of doing that which I think would be good you know very very good for everyone in the long run uh is some of the other things I'd like to see happen would happen also 
 so I'm 
 Yeah 
 right
 Right 
 Uh *[[slash error]] Right 
 The only problem is of course that uh that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there
 And they want to do the research 
 and uh they're all you know nor- 
 the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to Mars Which would produce some useful scientific research and so forth 
 but the same money could probably be far better spent on uh uh lunar bases and solar power satellite research and you know so forth
 it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor to get politician votes instead of for you know 
 we should eventually send people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so
 We should do it for the return we get for it
 And uh unfortunately that's not what I thinks happened 
 *[[listen]] I would settle for the glitz if the side effects were useful like the uh 
 but uh 
 the downside of that is after you do one of those people say well we did it
 now we're done 
 No need to play around with this space stuff anymore 
 That's what happened with Apollo 
 Uh *[[slash error]] But uh I'd give almost anything to get into space 
 *[[sd]] But uh I'd give almost anything to get into space
