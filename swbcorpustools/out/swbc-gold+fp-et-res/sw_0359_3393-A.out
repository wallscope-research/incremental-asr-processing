 That's a long time Uh
 Uh-huh
 Andrews
 Well for the past week or two it's been cold and wet
 but before that for most of the year it's been hot and dry
 Um September really was 
 I'm not sure about October 
 I think for about twelve months through September the average temperature has been higher than normal each month Um lots of ninety degree days during the summer
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh if you had it early
 Yeah 
 I think we usually have a frost in October
 Uh but you know We really need the rain that we've been getting 
 and it has not today 
 but the last few days it's been pouring most of the day
 Flooding anywhere 
 I have not heard of any problems of it flooding anywhere 
 that's occurred certainly at times in the past 
 but uh no 
 I've not heard of any particular problems this time
 Yes
 Yes 
 yeah 
 we had summer lasting long 
 then it became winter like uh today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day
 Yeah
 
 I don't know 
 Yeah 
 our leaves are all on the ground now 
 I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors
 Oh yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 we did for a time
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Been that this year for the trees for the leaves
 Um
 Yeah 
 that's because it can't tolerate a freeze this early 
 Is that right
 If it would came later it would be all right
 Um
