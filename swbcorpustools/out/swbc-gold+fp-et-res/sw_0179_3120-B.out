 Okay
 Well did you go to college
 And where did you go
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I went to the University of Minnesota
 I am 
 uh-huh 
 Where do you live now
 Well I'm in Texas 
 I'm in Austin
 Uh-huh
 I'm familiar with Plano 
 I visited once or twice
 Oh I love it
 I love it 
 I really do
 That's correct 
 I have two daughters 
 but my oldest will be a sophomore
 She has her heart set on U T
 And uh you know having gone to the University of Minnesota I know what a big university is like 
 And uh one thing that I did this summer which I thought might benefit both my daughters is my youngest daughter got involved in band 
 and Baylor has a band camp
 So she went for a week 
 and it was overnight 
 and they lived in the dorms 
 And I thought this would expose both of them to what it's you know like on a a smaller college campus 
 And uh my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school 
 So uh I still think the exposure was good
 The reason I ask if you went to college is I thought well you know 
 what were your selection criteria 
 Did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford 
 or you know there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision
 Oh wow
 Oh definitely
 Uh-huh
 Oh how exciting
 Uh-huh
 Oh That worked out very well for you
 Well then he should come to U T
 Uh-huh
 Large classes
 Oh I went from a large high school to a large university 
 and I definitely felt like I was a number 
 Uh it is a different feeling
 But that was my only option
 I just really couldn't look at anything else 
 That was the one and only thing I could really afford other than you know a junior college which I didn't want to do 
 So that's how you know my decision was made 
 But uh 
 Yes
 what does 
 he hopes to be a writer
 Huh
 Oh she has uh you know interests that are just you know going in all directions
 Uh what she talks about a lot is theater which I think is 
 okay Bethany let's be real 
 Uh she really is pretty unfocussed at this point 
 And I don't know 
 she's taken a lot of French 
 and she may end up doing something with that
 And I am a single mom 
 so I've been 
 and I made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married 
 So I'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake 
 And I'm you know showing them if you're strong in math and science kiddos this is one area where women can make some decent money You know 
 I'm kind of really putting the practical application you know and saying yet do something that you enjoy
 By all means go get that piece of paper you know 
 Do you just have one son
 I see 
 Well it sounds like he's got some really you know good strong ideas of what he wants to do
