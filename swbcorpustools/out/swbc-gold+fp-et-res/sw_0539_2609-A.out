 Well do you think uh 
 I wonder 
 the assumption is that it is a problem uh 
 and I've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem though I have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem 
 uh but it's not clear to me that it is
 Um it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions 
 But if those who don't vote if you made them vote 
 and it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way you know in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote it's not clear to me that it is really a problem um
 I assume that those who don't vote 
 if you look at the break down of those who don't vote they tend to be you know 
 poor blacks for example vote very little and things like that 
 and I assume that they would vote differently if they were voting than your average voter 
 But I don't know if that's the case
 In fact I've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't
 Uh I guess not 
 I vote religiously 
 I really do 
 Um I guess I'm a fan of democracy 
 and uh wish I could vote on more things frankly
 But it's funny because here in California things are getting uh increasingly democratically oriented in the sense of people being able to vote for things 
 we have these state initiatives now
 The first really you know wide spread one was uh Proposition Thirteen which was a uh tax revolt against property taxes 
 Uh and you know now we're 
 and that was whatever ten years ago 
 and now we're up to Proposition a Hundred and fifty or something like that 
 we've just 
 there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were being asked to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals 
 and you had to vote for you know yes or no on each of them 
 and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them 
 and it was incredibly complicated and difficult 
 And a lot of people revolted against that 
 they said we don't want to have to decide all these things
 you know that's why we hire people uh you know to make these decisions for us
 Yeah
 I do t- 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I wouldn't mind having oh more votes than I get to have frankly 
 Anyone who doesn't vote it's fine with me as long as I can have their vote
 That would make me happy though 
 Maybe not in a deep philosophical sense but in a selfish sense it probably would 
 I don't know 
 it's interesting uh some countries voting is obligatory
 Uh it is in Australia for example
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I don't know how I feel about that 
 Well Australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the United States
 And it's not for me to say that they're not
 Um they feel 
 here you have the right to vote 
 and they simply define it as a duty there 
 You know just as we have a duty to pay taxes you know 
 is that democratic 
 we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country 
 we have the duty to pay taxes
 And in that country it's a duty to pay taxes 
 and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent 
 And it's not clear to me that that's so much less democratic 
 Um I don't know 
 but part of me rebels against that
 but then I'm an American
 Yeah 
 And some people don't vote 
 there is 
 like three or four percent of Australians don't vote 
 and I think they're eligible for a fine 
 I don't know if they actually are fined or what happens 
 but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I was sort of s- 
 Well I 
 that's how I feel 
 if you vote and your guy looses well you least tried 
 and you can say something 
 but if you don't vote part of me and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like well if you didn't vote you get what's coming to you you know
 And certainly that's true in the overall 
 no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole 
 I sort of feel that way especially when they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for or something like that 
 *[[listen: two utts]] And you know I say well you know voting for the lesser of two evils is still important
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it's funny because technically you do 
 you have the right to do a write in candidate 
 But of course that's not really a vote 
 Um
 Yes 
 it really doesn't 
 and so it's a complicated situation 
 but I would like to see 
 I don't know 
 I'm thinking of actually moving to Australia 
 and perhaps I'll call you back and let you know how the Australian system works
 [ not because of the vo- + I'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting but just because of a job opportunity
 And uh I 
 No 
 I'm not 
 uh so I'm really quite curious how that would work to have both you know 
 and I believe in a certain uh 
 Soviet bloc countries you are obliged to vote too 
 In fact it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for up until fairly recently 
 and that's what I think of when I think of you're obliged to vote 
 But when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country with its two party system um 
 I don't know 
 I kind of 
 part of me is wary 
 and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty um
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Well that's a thought 
 or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have 
 I don't know 
 The right to write your 
 Yeah 
 see that's an example of a right not a 
 actually 
 that's considered a privilege not a right
 Yeah 
 but technically most people 
 technically it's a privilege 
 but most people think of it as a right 
 in other words if the government denies you a drivers license people get very upset 
 But actually it's a privilege which is allowed to be revoked
 And fortunately voting isn't that
 well except if you're a felon 
 if you're a felon it is taken away from you
 they will take away your right to vote under certain circumstances
 Um so gosh 
 so we don't have a great solution yet do we 
 But I don't know if you've uh read any of uh the early uh republic documents uh when they were arguing through constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people
 Um oh I think it was Hamilton who wrote number ten or something where he was arguing for a republican not in the sense of the Republican party now versus a democratic uh government and arguing successfully why the United States should be a republic not a democracy Which indeed it really is a republic not a democracy 
 Where he defines democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues 
 In other words you vote for representatives
 And the whole idea was um presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy
 Because just as you can have a tyranny of a single um you know bad ruler or something you can have a tyranny of the majority
 And uh he makes a very uh passionate good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process 
 because anytime you have a majority um they can change the law in a fully democratic process 
 and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case Um 
 oh you know a candi- 
 if there's some minority that people don't like because of you know racial hatred or something like that the majority can just simply vote against them
 And cases like that he argues need to be constrained 
 and actually I agree except that I don't trust the people who are appointed to vote 
 Yeah 
 well I feel that wa- 
 Yeah 
 well their job is to be reelected by in large 
 and so they work on that job 
 And there's also an antigovernment mood in the country you know where government is misspending your dollars 
 and they're all fools 
 and you know throw the bastards out 
 that kind of thing
 And there's a notion that somehow if someone isn't as much as a government person they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange 
 because if I'm hiring a plumber I want a real plumber 
 I want someone trained in
