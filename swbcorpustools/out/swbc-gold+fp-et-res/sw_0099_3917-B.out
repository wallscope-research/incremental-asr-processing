 Oh sure 
 Uh well I uh went to school at Madison for two years 
 and they are really big on women's rights and equal treatment
 And so I've seen a lot of like rallies and things like that 
 But uh I'm not that liberated 
 I mean my mom is kind of old-fashioned you know 
 So you know you pick up some traits from her and stuff 
 But uh I think it's interesting and better for women to see that there's more of them doing men's fields 
 I like to see that 
 And I don't like to see women you know like waiting on men hand and foot 
 but you know I believe in like sharing and doing things for each other
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Oh me too 
 I hope that happens to me someday 
 I don't mind doing stuff 
 Uh I have a boyfriend 
 and I got to make him dinner and stuff 
 but you know he'll help me do the dishes 
 I don't want to you know expect to help to clean up then after 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 So 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Oh yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh me too
 Yeah 
 I like to see that 
 I think it's uh really neat to see and all that educated minority uh person who really knows what they're talking about 
 And it's just too bad that some people you know still look down on them just because of their color You know
 Especially black women
 So 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Right 
 same here 
 Yeah
 Right 
 Same here 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Exactly 
 I see more men uh like participating in like the family things with children Like you know helping to take care of them more and uh uh doing the jobs equally you know
 Oh
 I'm not that big on politics 
 I'm not that educated on it 
 I'm 
 Oh yeah 
 I agree with that
 Oh I don't know 
 Yeah 
 I know who you're talking about 
 Yeah 
 At least she was strong to like try it and you know 
 So that's good 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
