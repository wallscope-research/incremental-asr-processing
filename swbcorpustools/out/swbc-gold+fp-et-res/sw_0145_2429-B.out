 Well uh lately since I have children I've cut down on having dinner parties 
 but when I do I try to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare ahead of time 
 uh I have one recipe for uh a really good um type of a meatball 
 It's called burgundy meatball 
 and it's made with red wine and 
 um
 it's really good 
 and you can make it ahead of time and then um make the sauce when you're ready um to serve it
 That's one of my favorite things to serve
 Sure
 Oh really 
 Well I guess being from that part of the country
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well how do you cook crawfish 
 in fact I just came back from the grocery store 
 and being in Texas we don't have too many you know people that eat crawfish
 but they had live crawfish on sale
 Uh-huh
 Don't buy them that way 
 Uh-huh
 Okay 
 Well I'll remember that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh um when you serve it do you shell them and then serve em too
 Um-hum
 Sure
 Still have see that *[[slash error]] Ooh 
 *[[slash error should be 'ba']] Um-hum
 Does it taste a lot like shrimp
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Sure
 Yeah 
 We have a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks all the time 
 And 
 Yeah 
 that's what I wish I had 
 but in our family I am the one who who cooks 
 And I really enjoy it 
 it's gotten a little more difficult with kids 
 But I really do enjoy cooking 
 And um we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot 
 And before I had my second child we sort of had a contest going where you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me 
 and we 
 was really a lot of fun
 and 
 Yeah
 it did
 we tried to be fancier or more courses than the other
 or 
 Uh it was a lot of fun you know 
 it something unique you know 
 and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food Or um sometimes it would be um oh Oh I don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know 
 It was a lot of fun
 That's right 
 it was fun 
 and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time Uh Just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying
 I'm 
 It does 
 except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just to uh make sure that they didn't have to do it again
 make hot dogs or some potato chips
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's nice
 it can be fun if you have the time 
 But you know a lot of times it's too much of a rush really be able to 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 um it's in the other room 
 I don't know if we have enough time for it 
 it's real easy 
 one of the unique things in this it's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um whatever seasonings 
 you can just light 
 so salt and pepper Um and chopped up water chestnuts which is something different um
 makes them a little bit crunchy 
 you need to chop em up real fine
 But um it makes them crunchy 
 and that adds something new to it 
 And then the sauce is just made with um bouillion cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour
 So it's not a thick rich type of a sauce 
 it's more of a 
 when you use corn starch in gravy like you know when you have um Chinese food That kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that They use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies 
 *[[ Shouldn't this be 2 slash units I'm confused by the capital letter on "They" ]] And it gives it a bit of a different consistency
 The meatballs um after you form them fry them in a pan until they're uh browned on all sides 
 and then drain off all the grease 
 Uh then what I usually do is I freeze them 
 And then when you're ready to serve them then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce And heat it 
 probably you have to heat it up for a good oh 
 if they're frozen you know it may take a half for them to thaw out 
 But then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself 
 Let them simmer in the sauce itself
 and it's real good
 Right
 And then freeze them
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 you'll meet friends 
 invite the boss over and friends at work 
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Oh
 really
 Well I think we've covered the subject 
 I got some interesting information about crawfish 
 I was in fact 
 It's good cause I was curious about that today when I saw those for sale
 Oh I will 
 I'm sure my husband will be surprised 'cause we were talking about them the other day before
