 I guess by what you said you don't feel you're uh privacy has been invaded anytime recently
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh no 
 I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means 
 Uh you know I would 
 there's a lot of times though uh you get those calls you know when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or whatnot 
 and you know next thing you know uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that 
 and it's real hard to tell them you know that you're not interested 
 Or you do tell them you're not interested 
 and they still keep asking you you know and keep badgering you about it 
 and that aggravates me 
 But I don't know that you could call that invading my privacy 
 because you know if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look you know I want my name unlisted or want my you know 
 It doesn't
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Good grief 
 Well let me ask you about this 
 Here's something that uh has been kind of concerning me lately 
 My fiance received a bill from a Lord and Taylor company
 Uh you know they're a department store
 She received a bill from them uh that she had visited some sto- 
 and I think it was there in Florida 
 maybe it was in Miami 
 That uh she had visited a store there 
 and uh they had this bill uh that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise uh over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise
 Uh and the date that she supposedly made this purchase she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving
 Uh and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number
 Uh and I've heard recently uh uh that this is a common occurrence where people are using s- you know 
 they use Joe Blow's social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someone's credit
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well y- 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well we got it cleared up eventually 
 What happened uh
