 Well I haven't had an awful lot of uh incidents regarding child care 
 When my two year old was in New Orleans she got bit on the cheek 
 uh but uh that's about uh the extent of it
 but when 
 I really am concerned that uh so many of these child care places are coming under uh uh you know investigation for uh you know child molestation
 and I'm saying to myself well you know you dump your little turnip off to uh you know this child care place 
 and they don't pay very much 
 and why would they be interested in your little turnip unless you know one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest you know 
 And uh that's a terrible kind of thing 
 and I don't think my children have ever been subject to that 
 but my wife didn't work 
 and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it
 Huh
 Huh
 Oh well that's interesting
 Oh my God
 Well you must have just one hero ace professional job to support something like that
 Oh well yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Well not all of us 
 You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for 
 I'm an engineer
 And 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Five hundred dollars a week For two kids 
 That's incredible
 Oh oh 
 Well 
 W- 
 Yeah 
 You know 
 they could 
 somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare 
 and you know that's a good starting wage 
 but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care 
 Huh
 we used <> to pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit 
 But mine are twenty-two twenty-three and twenty-seven 
 so you know that 
 I guess baby-sitters now are up at what five dollars an hour
 Oh my
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
