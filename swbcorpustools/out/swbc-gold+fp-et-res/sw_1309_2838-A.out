 Yes 
 Right
 Yes 
 Right
 Yeah
 Right
 They do 
 {C and} [you + boy you] can get them on either side 
 {C and} just like you say 
 {F uh} {D well} [[I think + [I + I guess] I'd have to place myself {F uh} probably seven or eight 
 {C because} 
 {C or} not 
 [[w- + w-] + ] onto no control 
 {E I'm sorry} {E excuse me} that 
 {F uh} two or three 
 I was going the wrong direction 
 {F Uh} {C because of} we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child because they had a gun in the house 
 {C and} the father kept the bullets in a separate place 
 {C but} the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to 
 {F uh} he knew where [booth + both] places were loaded the gun 
 {C and} they were playing cowboys and Indians 
 {C and} he shot the other little boy right between the eyes
 {D So} {F uh} 
 I mean it 
 it destroyed two families {F uh} in just that instant 
 [{C and} + {C and}] [I + a lot of people] say that they need it for protection {F uh} 
 having worked at one time in Baltimore 
 {C or} 
 I don't know if you're in the big city
 are you 
 Dallas
 That's a big city 
 {F Uh} then {D you know} that {F uh} {F uh} 
 if you live anywhere real close that {F uh} 
 the safety is {F uh} 
 some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and you know 
 {C But} {F uh} {F uh} we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up 
 {F Uh} I {F uh} 
 once {F uh} {F uh} knew a fellow that had had been a policeman 
 {C and} he said that if you pull a gun on a robber he's going to assume that you know how to use it well 
 {C and} he's going to {D you know} try to shoot first
 {F Uh} {D so} {D you know} if he's got one 
 {F Uh} {C and} if not 
 {F uh} then usually they {F uh} 
 if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you 
 {E I mean} {D you know} [they + they] 
 he said that [it + it] was better not to have 
 especially myself now I'm a widow 
 {C and} {F uh} 
 [[I + {C so} I'm] +] when my handicapped son [is + is] not at home I'm by myself 
 {C but} {F uh} there's 
 I still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's really {F uh} playing Russian Roulette if you do 
 {F Uh} 
 That's right
 That's right
 Right
 That's right
 Right
 That's right
 I know 
 No
 No 
 that's true 
 [[That + That's] + that's] right 
 that's right
 Right
 {D Well} yeah 
 that's how I feel too 
 I know {D well} 
 [e- + even] here where I work {F uh} we have [a + a] gun club 
 {C And} of course those people are very avid 
 [They + {D you know} they] say there should be no ban 
 that it's not 
 {C but} I can't see why any {F uh} o- on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun
 {F Uh} {D you know} when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide 
 {C but} there are a few guns that {F uh} just are not {F uh} sport 
 {C or} {E I mean} 
 I don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either 
 {D So} {F uh} [I + I] think they should have at least some control over over those things 
 {F Uh} {C and} when you were speaking about how they can check up {D you know} on credit cards 
 {D well} [I + I] understand about the privacy act {C and} everything 
 {C but} why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not 
 That to me would not be an unreasonable thing
 {C And} if they do 
 course the argument with the people in the gun club {F uh} is that {F uh} {D well} the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway
 {C And so} it's not going to be that they're buying them 
 Course some of them do
 {C So} it it is a hard question 
 Right 
 oh yeah
 That's right
 Okay 
 {D well} thanks for talking
 Bye-bye now
