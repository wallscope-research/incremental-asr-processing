 Oh I like it 
 actually I have more than one foreign automobile 
 And uh I find the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters 
 I was trying to build a shed 
 and they give you these measurements like forty-two and three eighths inches 
 and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths uh 
 Well no 
 What we did was wind up using 
 and you just go down 
 and you get out so many inches 
 and we just marked a little bit less than that uh which is somewhat awkward 
 but had it been millimeters you could have done 
 I think what's interesting 
 the way engineering people do is they 
 they in essence have gotten around it by listing uh decimal inches
 are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that 
 Well are you involved in any other uh metric type things like 
 I think it's interesting you know when you go out there 
 and you're looking for a wrench 
 and you want the next size larger 
 I inherited some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds
 Well now that one's fairly easy because that's probably slightly under half an inch 
 But some of them like twenty-seven 
 and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that uh don't translate
 Yeah 
 and you've got to go over there and try it 
 and I suppose you know I need a larger one 
 I need a smaller one 
 obviously you can look at it and say well anyway 
 I think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't 
 I don't know 
 do you drink adult beverages
 have you noticed um that um a lot of 
 Yes
 like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange
 What's a fifth of whiskey 
 It was a marketing ploy
 Yeah 
 But the idea was is that with five fifths um uh they could sell five 
 and um it was simply a ploy to get people you know to buy more for 
 uh I find that interesting
 But it's like you know the soda and this kind of things coming in one liter bottles 
 and um I think it's kind of generational 
 Although I must admit that I'm not conversant in saying you know that's three centimeters away or Yeah 
 
 Yeah 
 it's hard to think though
 It's like a mill you know 
 uh um well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill bond wire on semiconductor devices 
 And well what's a mill 
 and 
 Yeah
 Don't you find that interesting Uh that they're doing that uh in any field 
 why pieces 
 could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't
 Oh okay
 The bolts were English then
 Now that's strange
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Essentially they do that though 
 because if you look at General Motors the size 
 and of course Ford and Chrysler 
 if they all went metric 
 but in a sense um you know it's like when you're milling something uh you simply set your uh equipment 
 or you got your calipers there 
 and you measure you know 
 you mic it to see if it's accurate 
 and 
 No
 Yeah
 Yeah
 You get you a pair of metric pliers right 
 And you beat on it 
 and a metric hammer 
 Oh I don't think so 
 uh I think they've now just taken the attitude that well if it 
 because there a lot of things uh um like sports you know 
 It's a hundred meter
 uh uh but automobile races 
 if it 
 I don't think they'd ever 
 it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred 
 They're not going to 
 Yeah 
 and I don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality uh 
 it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold 
 How many ounces of gold you know
 I was trying to figure up gold content on something 
 It has uh gold plated uh header 
 and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce
 Yeah 
 Now that makes you know 
 Well and then there's a metric ton 
 and then there's a ton 
 But what's a metric ton
 I don't know
 Yeah 
 but then the medicine 
 and some of these other things 
 and the chemistry in those kinds of areas 
 milliliter 
 Yeah 
 but when you go to order a drink um you know say I don't know it's uh 
 I don't know 
 but you know when you go to the store and you're trying to figure you know well this box is twelve ounces 
 and this one's uh uh three pounds um 
 and you 
 That's right 
 and I don't know 
 I think the Federal government is going to more or less leave it alone 
 I think there are more pressing problems
 Yes
 Yeah 
 but are the tools that uh 
 if you're cutting 
 are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for set up 
 Huh
 So you've got thousands of dollars or so 
 I mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools
 Yes
 But I was thinking about though that when you actually get to the milling equipment though when it starts turning 
 Yeah
 But when you simply drilling a hole a real simple thing like gee 
 I need a hole there
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 but the thing is then you've got to with screws 
 and that's the other issue Uh 
 the pitch and
