 Well I think they're kind of ambivalent really 
 Uh I just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know
 half the time we don't know who to support
 That and you know maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with uh countries like that that depend on us so much without you know running their country for them 
 but 
 It's got to be tough 
 but uh uh you still have to you know let them know how you feel
 Yeah 
 it worries me that uh the economy of so many countries in South America and Central America depend on something that damages people you know like cocaine from Columbia 
 and uh you know of course I'm sure we have some enemies down there who wouldn't care what happened to us 
 but that's a tough deal 
 and it 
 I don't think that 
 maybe it's you know I'm reflecting how I feel about it 
 but I have a feeling that we really don't understand basically the competing factions in lot of those countries 
 and they've been hammering for the last you know ten centuries 
 and it's still going on 
 and uh we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how some times
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 um well I'm blank on it
 I can see his face forget his name 
 Yeah 
 kind of nationalized it for himself
 Yeah
 Dictator 
 Yeah
 And it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing 
 you know unstable 
 Well I think it's long overdue
 uh I just you know 
 there's so much difference in the economies of the two countries you know I have a problem uh with whether it's going to work or not you know 
 uh it seems like there's 
 and I 
 this may be unfair to Mexico 
 but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in foreign policy a lot of the times
 Yeah
 Yeah
 yeah
 I think their version of the good old boy network going that 
 uh you know has a lot
