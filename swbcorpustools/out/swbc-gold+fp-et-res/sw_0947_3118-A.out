 Okay 
 do you want to start
 Uh-huh
 Now do you agree that they should all be unanimous
 Or even in uh like they said you know lesser you know trials you know lesser convictions do you think that they should be all unanimous still
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous 
 if one is determined you know that he feels that he's you know going against the other eleven they all stay until everyone agrees 
 So I don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting you know just gives in
 And they have to stay in until they all agree
 yeah 
 I don't know 
 I'm not sure if they go to twelve new people or what they do exactly 
 but I do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before [ he can either + you know either he or she can either go free or to jail either one
 Uh-huh
 that's just it 
 I don't understand 
 You're supposed to you know go in you know like if you've never heard of the people before or anything 
 but I don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are totally impartial to it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I agree 
 I don't think it should be left up to the judge alone 
 Not only you know that they have to stay in there 
 but hey 
 how many times have you heard of judges being bought over
 You know so I think in the end the judge has the presiding you know uh vote 
 I don't know if it's the way it is in real life 
 but I've seen it on T V where the juries go one way 
 and the judge totally finds it obnoxious 
 and he completely you know goes the other way
 Now I'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh oh my God 
 If there were more than twelve can you imagine how long they'd be sitting 
 I think it's as fair as it can possibly get 
 but I just think it's really har- you know 
 some cases go on for years you know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I don't know how it could be more fair 
 Course I don't know 
 maybe they should be asking someone that's been on trial before
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I know 
 I don't know that much about it either 
 I don't know 
 I guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail you know how they can make it more fair for them or not 
 but then again maybe they should be there 
 so that is fair
 I don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh I think we can hang up anytime 
 No 
 I don't
 what else to say 
 so 
 It was nice talking to you too 
 Bye
