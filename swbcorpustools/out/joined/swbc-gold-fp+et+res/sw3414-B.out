Yes Uh-huh I see Yeah they do it started out several years ago when they put these collection sites they near a WalMart near a football stadium and the like and they just couldn't believe how many people were going out of their way to fill these things up These huge dumpsters were being filled up in a in a matter of a week So they knew that there was something going on here So they started looking into programs and what we have now it they changed the whole way that they do garbage in Plano Instead of collecting plastic bags of garbage two days a week they make a collection on Monday for yard waste and the yard waste has to be put in a special bag that's a decomposable paper sack it's a pretty good size It's maybe the size of two or three grocery bags And we put that out by the street and they collect those on Monday And then on Wednesday we put out two containers that they gave us One container's a huge green monstrous thing that a a special truck comes by and hooks onto the side of it and flips the container into the back of the garbage truck So and that's where you put your regular garbage and trash And then also that same day you put out a small tub it's maybe two feet high and three feet by two feet wide and you put just throw in your aluminum and your milk jugs and newspaper and then the Exactly they have a big truck that has like te- not ten maybe five big doors on the side of it and they throw the different stuff in the different doors Yeah it is And apparently it's you know it it went off pretty much without a hitch The trucks the special five door trucks were a little tough in getting because of something to do with the Persian Gulf war that the trucks were being the engines or something were being shipped over there for something or other But it does work pretty well yes uh-huh I noticed something interesting last time I guess two Wednesdays ago when they were picking up I happened to be out there in the morning when they were picking up the that tub stuff and the man who was doing the separating when he was done emptying the tub he took a little electronic reader device off of his belt and he read the bar code that was on the side of the tub So they must be collecting information about who does it and how often Yeah Uh-huh I I don't know but I think that's a really interesting question Yeah that that seems farfetched only because it it there's no law that says you have to buy a newspaper or pop cans or milk jugs So there there's it's possible that there is a person in Plano that doesn't buy any of those three things and therefore wouldn't have Right No they won't take vegetable cans Just just the aluminum pop cans Yeah Yeah what they're doing with that I would Someday I'm sure we'll find out Uh-huh So tell me your feelings on recycling Is it do you think this is a good thing or silly Yes Yes Yeah Dump them off Yeah and that is interesting Right Yeah Well the Pl- yeah the Plano newspaper each each day in fact has a a little list of all the recycling centers for all the different things They publish it every single day Yeah and phone numbers and and that kind of stuff
