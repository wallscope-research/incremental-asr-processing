Okay Excuse me Yeah I'm from Indiana Uh-huh Yeah Yeah well I know like what you just said Purdue had to had to their best player this year you know averaged twenty points a game they had to make him sit the bench And actually kicked him off the team because his grades even though they passed Big Ten standings and they passed you know N C double A they weren't they did not pass Purdue requirements And so Yeah And see so he was treated like all the rest of students you know And so their very best player they probably lost over half their games because you know by twenty points which is what he averaged and so you know he had to sit you know he was kicked off the team And then they've got three players top you know recruiting class this year that they're going to have to be well the the prep school they go to before they can play because they aren't smart enough You know it's just sad because I mean Purdue even though they're one of the few schools that really stress academics they're suffering you know and Yeah Like Yeah That's what happened to this guy I mean he was he didn't go to class and so they just said you know you can't make the grades you're going to have to see you later Yeah I don't either It's Yeah yeah it is fun to watch some real disciplined teams play in in college And I saw Princeton I think it was or Harvard play this year They're like all white and their starting guard had S A T scores of fifteen hundred And it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams because it was like they played so much smarter and more disciplined I don't know if they won very many games But I don't know their style of play was so much different from from the teams that just run and gun Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah I'm kind of racist I guess when I say I like to see the white guys do well you know Instead of the run and gun all the time should be two slash units Yeah Yeah In fac- There's just so much pressure on the schools I think to win though you know Yeah And you know it's like if they don't win they don't get any money so and the school suffers which is kind of bad but that's just how it always is Yeah Yeah Really Yeah It really is I know there's a lot of pressure on schools to have a winning program To get the best athletes so they can keep their seats full Purdue Yeah So Uh-huh Are you from Dallas area Yeah I guess football is the big sport down here isn't it Yeah You heard of Have you heard of Damon Bailey The I U white guard that plays Well last year when he was in high school they drew a crowd of like forty-one thousand for the state finals when he played Yeah so that's I mean that's pretty big Like he's from Indiana and he plays for Indiana now And Indiana him to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there The Pacers don't really draw that big of a crowd You know the high school games I mean that seems to be the big attraction and college Yeah seems like you could set the score at a hundred and then give them five minutes to play then it'd be the same result Because they they start they shoot so much and then the last what five minutes they decide who's going to be the winner I guess Tarpley is he one Tarpley Yeah Uh-huh
