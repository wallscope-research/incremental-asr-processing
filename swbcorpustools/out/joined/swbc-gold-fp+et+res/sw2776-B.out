Okay Huh-uh Yeah what did you do when you did exercise regularly Huh-uh Huh-uh Yeah right now I try when it's nice out it's been raining a lot this spring but I try to I have a bicycle and I like to cycle a lot And my husband and I we have entered a few rallies that's pretty popular in Texas I don't know if it's up north but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally and thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles which that's a lot of fun so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that And T I where I work has a fitness center so a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill and they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine that are fun to ride and workout on So I try to I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis I used to get into it and get out of it based on my schedule so I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now but it's a big commitment We don't have any kids yet so that's a lot of part of it Huh-uh Yeah Yeah Huh-uh That's why they really stress at T I they really stress staying in shape like stay in fit overall fitness you know no smoking and all that But it's hard to find an actual exercise regimen that work for you you know because like I know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them on the bikes and I don't know if that would work for me because I don't know I wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain But it's really hard to find something that works and you know to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever I think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever Yeah Huh-uh Right Huh-uh Yeah I've been learning a lot lately about I've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper I don't know if you're familiar with him he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really He's he's kind of he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing he was talking about the three things you could that cause aging smoking are inactivity mistranscribed listen and what was the other one I think was yeah obesity If you can control those three areas then are you going to live longer you know cause those are risk factors so anyway it's kind of a tip Really Huh-uh Huh-uh Huh-uh Dr Price Huh-uh That's really interesting Huh-uh Yeah Huh-uh And what's the name of this book again I'll have to remember that That will be very interesting My husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon so he's really interested in the heart And he's in fact he's a well heart too he's he's done a lot of research on like how your heart reacts to exercise Sorry he made me laugh so anyway Yeah Huh-uh If you get a chance read Dr Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol That's a real good he talks about that Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that Huh-uh Huh-uh You have a good ratio of good to bad Cholesterol Yeah really That's good Yeah
