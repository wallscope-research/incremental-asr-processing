I pay a good deal of taxes I guess because I I make a fair amount of money and the taxes that I pay I guess as a as a general statement I feel I I guess I get my money's worth for I'm not sure though whether I feel I guess I am sure that I feel that in general though the allocation of the taxes in certain areas i- isn't correct Well I I lately I guess or at least for the last twenty years or so I've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost defense items at least in the last ten years have been there's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there and I'm not really sure that that we've gotten our money's worth there regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm Desert Shield situations I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi- military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is I've found that you know there's an extraordinary amount of waste I take that as a as a given in any military operation and yeah and I gue- I I should imagine that that that what the what the problem why I I'm I'm a little concerned about today is that this rather quick and and easy I don't know I shouldn't say easy rather quick victory in the in in the Mideast over the Iraqis might lead us into a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe I'm I I don't know what other foe that would be but I I'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area Yeah but it it it would that be well let's see two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent I I should imagine that that would be to keep it at a level those levels I guess that that were originally appropriated w- was when the Soviet threat I guess was perceived as being a greater one I don't think there's very much of a threat there today I do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in the territories in their territory over there and who's controlling them but I I don't know what amount of what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic I guess from doing anything that would be irrational Right Yeah Yeah what is the name of that Yes yes Yeah well I'm what I'm I guess it concerned about talking about the taxes in general and that that was an area that I I perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for in the area of defense or perhaps we have paid too much there I don't know it just seems to me that over the years now the and and it's it's a cliche I I but I see it myself I see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways I I I don't know I kn- I'm familiar with some some upbeat school areas so I don't totally agree with the the great with the with the great ex- expenditure of effort and time there but I guess overall because I guess I'm not associated with what ghetto schools and and and rural school systems are like I I should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure Uh-huh They they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system or is it all funded out of local taxes Yeah Sounds like the way the federal and state system works now Yeah do you mean a a complete reversal Because I guess they can't raise that money in those those poorer districts Yeah Yes I see what you're saying I I I do I I guess I am a s- a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education I mean by that I mean I'm a product myself I have a a a a background of being getting my college education through the G I Bill What but when I look at it to me it doesn't really make any difference It was a marvelous opportunity that I couldn't have done I don't think I would have gone on unless I had that financial easement made possible And I I don't really care what it takes to qualify whether you're an an ex- whether you're a veteran or whether you I don't even know if you have to perform community service or unless or or you promise to even do something in the future I think that the that that the subsidy itself or I guess the enactment of that form of legislation would give many people who I I think I think I perceive the fact at least what I read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their out of their budget I know in the state of Florida just today the the legislature adjourned and they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the in the state land grant colleges which which isn't I mean to me it doesn't sound like a mo- lot of money but I guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year They went from eleven to fifteen hundred and for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty-five per cent I don't know what that would be But that I guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to was expending so much money on defense that that the program now is a program now is fees that that fund these things I guess that's trickled down to the states and the states now establish don't have enough money so they they must charge fees I I'm not too sure of that reasoning But I guess to get back to the main topic I don't know whether I pay too much taxes I I I travel extensively in Europe and see enormous people p- pay a great deal in taxes they tell me when I sit and talk to people there they tell me they they some states they pay in Germany or in in England in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to six- fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes But but I'm not too sure when I put my property tax in my car tax my income tax and these myriad of now it costs me money to leave the country some sort of a tax to leave the country some sort of an airport departure tax a tax a sales tax which is getting to quite high levels I'm not sure that I'm not up fairly close to that You really think so But I mean w- what's what's happened here is is is I feel that that in the last ten years my taxes have gone up they haven't gone down I pay ex- quite a bit more taxes and and and but that's been a Republican government for the last ten years Well I Yeah Okay I guess I just push something here Push one again right Just hang up Okay Don good talking with you Bye-bye
