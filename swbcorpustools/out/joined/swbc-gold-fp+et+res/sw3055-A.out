And I guess the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party if we wanted to do something like that or share recipes or something Are you one who gives dinner parties very often No nor am I They are a lot of work that is for sure Yes Yeah Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah Right yes Uh-huh that's great You sound like my mother who has been well I bake pies too but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family and she has the same the same technique I mean I guess after many years of doing it you just kind of do it second nature  She enjoyed it Well there is a woman in our choir who is nearly famous for her apple pies and we had a a an auction one time at the church excuse me and one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars Well I think I I have had it once and it has been a few years ago but I do recall that it was quite good so Yeah So that is her specialty I like to bake also I do not bake so much now that my children are grown but I do enjoy baking and I guess I always liked making cookies and bars and things like that that was more my specialty I suppose And they seem to last longer than pies around here pies would go practically in a day's time Yes Right And Well it is interesting that yesterday I had lunch with a friend and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend for friends of hers For one of her acquaintances one of her old friends I guess had been in town and they invited two other couples over and so there were seven of them that I said "well what did you have" and she said what she had just Mexican food but you know she had guacamole and I cannot remember all she had But she also had made flan which is actually Spanish I think Have you ever made that or had it It's it's I had used to work with a gentleman who was from Cuba who would make it it's just a wonderful dessert It's like an egg custard in a caramelized sugar with on top of it And it's it's quite actually not very difficult to make but it's very very high in cholesterol I am sure with all the eggs that are in it But she said that she and her husband had traveled in Spain a couple years ago And and flan is almost a basic with every meal that you get there Yeah uh-huh It's just very customary to get flan So if you ever run into that you will sort of be aware of what that is all about But I would never have thought of making that as part of a a Mexican dinner but you know sopapillas I guess would be another kind of a dessert if you decided to do something like that But flan is something you can make ahead and have just you know have ready but Well I would have been thinking I would like to have a dinner party sometime soon but I tell you it th- I my it's one of those things where it does require some real planning and it's you know you don't just make the dinner you have the house to clean and you know the whole business that goes with it Yeah Probably a good way to do it the house needs cleaning I guess I had better have a dinner party Oh Uh-huh Oh Good heavens  wow That is such a nice thing it's I you know until well we have my husband and I have been married twenty six years and until last year I had never had another person clean my house and then I got so involved and so busy I said "this is one luxury I am going to let myself have every now and then" And so I had a woman come in once a month and you know it was not just very often but for me it was wonderful Well it is and it is buys you time to do other things like have a dinner party I guess So it is just a real gift of time as far as I am concerned but well I Uh-huh I have heard about that but I have never tried it No well I should say I have heard of one that has vinegar in it I do not know that it has egg in it uh-huh Do you have it right on the top of you head You do not have it yeah I would Uh-huh Right quite large yeah Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah what is it about the the vinegar that makes the crust better  Interesting Yeah yeah boy that that's the real secret th- it makes me think of years ago when I was visiting my mother-in-law in Michigan she lived very near an apple orchard and we just had we could take as many apples as we wanted from it Accor- you know according to the owners and so I decided to bake about four pies ahead you know and freeze them well talk about working with big amounts of pie crust and having it be tough Those were the toughest apple crust or apple pie crust I have ever ever made It was terrible I I could have used that recipe it sounds like Where about Well we lived in Plymouth for four years Yeah In fact I we were there from seventy three to seventy seven and I was I worked for the little the weekly newspaper there the the Plymouth what was it called CRIER And my husband is from the upper peninsula so he was born and raised up there That is where my mother-in-law still lives so Are you originally from Michigan or Uh-huh I will be darn
