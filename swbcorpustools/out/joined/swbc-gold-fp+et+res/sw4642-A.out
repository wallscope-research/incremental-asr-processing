I try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair Actually that is really a sore spot with me I I think perhaps the automotive industry is improving but like ten years ago reliability of automobiles at least U S automobiles was pretty dismal and not only that but the repair capability of service departments and dealerships was equally dismal and it seemed that the only way I could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea But I Pardon Well at that time actually I had a Volkswagen Rabbit and it was it was a real lemon subsequently I got a Buick Century and it wasn't as bad But last year I bought a Honda Accord and I take it in once every seventy-five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance and that is it And it's wonderful    So wha- what do you have All the more reason to have a a Honda D- so you bought a Pontiac Now thi- wha- how old is the car    So apparently it was the same one that was on there Apparently just re- re- probably filled the the brake fluid up and that was it So what's the solution to that I guess find a reputable service  Uh-huh Right Well that's wonderful You're lucky really
