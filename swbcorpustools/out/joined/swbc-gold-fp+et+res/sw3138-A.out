Okay I guess we're going to discuss food and cooking Do you enjoy cooking I'm kind of that way too When I have I I enjoy cooking when I have time I don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday It gets kind of boring How big is the family you cook for Uh-huh We have four so and two of them are teenage boys so Are they Yeah Yeah Yeah we have that problem too But also now it's just the amount that they eat It's just absolutely incredible Yeah Does he Yeah That's true do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal Favorite recipes that you've come across or Uh-huh Out on the grill Uh-huh Ooh Uh-huh How yeah that's sound good I love that My husband really likes seafood and I think that no matter what I do I don't serve enough of it really to to suit him I didn't grow up eating that much seafood and so I don't know it's just kind of not natural to me but I like it And I don't know one of his favorite things is well it's called seafood stew and it's really it's really like a s- soup that that you serve over rice And it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it And No no That's kind of Louisiana I think if you do that Yeah I don't either But no this is just re- it is really good and and one thing that's good is it makes the a large amount And so I've usually we eat one and I freeze two containers of it Then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice But neither of my kids will eat it You know so then they eat a pizza or Yeah it really does One thing I've run across <> recently though a friend gave me a recipe that I really like for chicken enchiladas Have you made them Does he Uh-huh Yeah Well are these are done with a flour tortilla Is that what he uses Yeah Isn't that something Yeah I was going to say my kids both eat it I guess that's one thing that I particularly like But I think it's good for you know for for company too and I've made it a few times and you can make a lot at one time when I needed to make something to to give somebody You know like you know to take over to somebody's house or something else It it's nice when it makes a lot because you can feed your own family and then Uh-huh What what does it have in it Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Sure Sometimes those are the best ones Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that sounds good Uh-huh yeah Those are good aren't they <> Uh-huh  That sounds good Right You cook the rice before you put it in Yeah I bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really kind of gives it a tang that would be good I guess I would now use the the new mayonnaise free Yeah That's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many new things like that because like I told my husband this summer I love to eat you know chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that and and you know basically it certainly a l- low calorie you know good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing You know and now it's it's it's okay and you can even I used to just put a tiny bit in Well now I'm just putting more and more in Yeah and it's only it used to be like a hun- hundred calories per tablespoon and now it's like twelve Oh I just think that's the best thing to have happened I'm just so excited about that Anyway <> Yeah Yes Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah That's when they As our family would say a pig out That's good one of my boys that that's twelve is has high cholesterol Have you ever found out about your kids and my other one does not So year or so ago he found out and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down And did He was able to get it down It's I think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol He's never eaten any eggs He's never had anything but skim milk and you know I've never bought butter and things like that But he just left for the doctor again and it's it's kind of back up so he needs to be careful again So we've really been talking about the foods you know for him to to be sure to eat and so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days And all that kind of stuff does really help Well I think we've probably talked long enough and <>
