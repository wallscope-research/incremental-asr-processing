Okay well personally I don't have any children I'm twenty-two and I'm doing my Master's at N C State so children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now So what what how do you spend the time with your children  Okay and did Yeah What what are you doing okay Do do they play like like does the eight year old play baseball Okay and and in in his league do they have like a pitcher or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what Okay okay Yeah I I used to play soccer when I was that age up in New York so Yeah and how about how about like on the weekends Do you do sports or do you go out Do you go how about like for do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off In the summer or like in the Easter time like around now And where do you go Have have you been out of the country okay well first they always say get to know your country first before you leave I mean I I lived in places like when I lived in Washington Washington D C I never went to the Washington Memorial and then when I went back to visit I went to the Washington Memorial Right Right Well it's it's a beautiful city But the problem is like first time I went out of here and they took me to Las Vegas and that was the most boring place on earth Yeah Did did like did you go to Disneyland okay So but now I don't know but but let's see when I was eleven I went also to the Caribbean That that was fun That was slash error two utts and then after that I my sister lives in Turkey so when I was like fourteen fifteen I went I went to Turkey And this Christmas I went to Turkey But basically it's a for the past couple of years I since my parents are are well I'm from Argentina and my parents live down there So all the traveling I do is alone And we were never much of a very family thing you know made like go skiing in Vermont or something That was that was a lot of fun But what happens is we used to fight a lot so there's never much of a family family thing You know one of those hell family vacations Yeah Yeah Well my dad all he all he wanted to do was get money for us so he could buy us material things And and to me you know it's like now I'm twenty-two but I still feel you know it's like yeah we never threw a football or something and the way I was brought up and he wants me now he like he you know like he wants to be best friends now and it's very hard for me because you know it's like you grow up to be twenty years old and it's always the same man and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old and he wants to be best friends but you know it's like I can only express myself so much because you know everything that he taught me you know that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say I'm sorry you know It's like you know I love you and let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it you know and so that's that whole thing that he'll say when like like I've seen my uncle and his family you know does everything together and you know his kids are you know when his little girl was five years old and everything they they would go to the beach and she could go to sleep at two in the morning you know and I was brought up the same way it doesn't matter what age you have just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up you know but his what he does is when he gets home he separates his work from his house Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah but it's just it's just something that you know my theory is you know when when you have kids and all you you want to do well what I'll do is you know like I mean you might have problems but it's not your kids' problems you know and you got to try to be with them as much as you can and to you know like thing is is that you know like if if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying I got a problem you know and and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time you know first of all you're coming to me and let's see how we can get rid of the problem you know and that's that's very that's very hard to do because once you're best friends with your parents then I think everything go a lot better Yeah Yeah my my father was raising four ki- well three kids before he had me so it was you know you're trying to support four kids and it's pretty hard you know and I I told him listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids He says yeah but then I wouldn't have you I go yeah but then you would have a lot of money Yeah But you know like four I mean fou- four children is expensive especially when you consider like especially for me which I'm paying out of state tuition I'm paying you know three thousand no what is it two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester And you know people say you know it's expensive to think it's college but if if everybody would be a little bit responsible you know it's like what does it what does it cost It costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose Now they go to a state college and they live at home you know and well it costs two hundred dollars for books but you know seven hundred dollars a semester a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead you know like I mean it's like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college you know excuse me Well I I'm doing computer science computer engineering Yeah and and now I'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home because since I'm an international student they want to send me back to Argentina Well my dad wants me to go back So No No because if you go back there then you can never get out Like you don't have any money to to get out So and I was thinking you know like Oh my God you know I go back there and then and I get married there and now I have kids there and then I'll never leave the place you know Yeah I know and that's that's what happened to my brother He came to school up here and then when he went down there he was just so bad off you know from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain So Yeah I've been calling a lot of companies There some of them are interested Well at least for a year and a half I can work so All right same here Bye-bye
