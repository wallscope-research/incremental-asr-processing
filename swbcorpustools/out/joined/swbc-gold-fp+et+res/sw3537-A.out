Okay what do you think about the self insurance business Uh-huh Well I I understand what you're saying and there's probably some truth to that I think that generally I don't welcome added government responsibilities However when a anybody can't police their own profession it eventually leads to that and I think the costs and the the way the medical profession has every year I being in my own business in the last six years every year there's been at least minimum twenty-five percent increase in health insurance costs and I think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance as as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter I think they're asking for it I I think the medical profession is just just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over <> and Well I I think a lot of it is I I don't disagree totally with that but my wife this last summer when we were on vacation tore up her knee and it was lig- ligaments in her knee as it turned out she came back that we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened and she got home and the leading orthopedic man who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come I mean he knows knee problems okay I mean if anyone does this guy knows it Well she goes in he says well I think this is what it is but you better go to the hospital and have one of these M R I things A thousand dollars for this magnetic resonance imaging type thing And my wife said well do I need that And he says well you know it it'll help me diagnose this I mean you know I I suggest you go have this thing Insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital Now a thousand dollars for thirty-five minutes I mean doctors routinely send people in for anything Now for years they didn't have this and they solved these problems and you know I said to her well look you know if you feel you got to go go but I I think a thousand dollars these guys I don't know what it is but there's no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day And even if they cost a hundred two hundred five hundred thousand dollars at roughly a thousand dollars every half hour that's ridiculous I I don't care what anyone says You know the costs are not it's a picture It shouldn't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that you know reasonableness But they aren't reasonable Fifty a hundred dollars They don't have to pay them back in three months time You know Well I think that should be that that's a another problem but that's part of our legalese problem And that the government eventually will address too just you know because it's out of control I I agree with you You know I was on a jury or I I didn't make the jury but there was a deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant Like it was three days after it was born and he was the one that delivered it And they got four attorneys one guy out of Houston he introduced himself as snake so-and-so and he says well anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars and I says yeah I got problems with I mean you know five million bucks isn't going to bring this kid back you know I mean as sorrowful as it is you know if the doctor is wrong you know he should be pulled from his license but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it you know it it doesn't make logical sense to me but that's
