Well the thing is is that I since I'm in school I don't like basically have a monthly budget because I'm living off my dad but the thing is is that I have to keep it under control because for example you know it's like the the beginning of the semester when you go to pay for everything everything is pretty rough but he controls that part but then whenever you know it's like once the semester starts I'm the one who has to control how much spending there is And the only thing that I I basically spend my money on is just food and so Well the thing is is that I live in a dorm So what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts And then the tuition is also the same thing So the thing is is basically that I spend like maybe thirty-five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries and that's about it But the thing also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then I have to moderate that because it's like I can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars you know three times a week So I mean it's for for us you know it's like I I can spend I can spend that money but it's not it's not what I want to spend it on you know No Because they don't allow me to work since I'm a foreign student And so they the government doesn't allow me to work Uh-huh Well the thing is is that I ba- I basically know how much I have right And so the thing is is that I I can tell like I I get all my money out of the teller And besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have to call you know international Argentina Yeah And so the bas- one of the problems is that I spend too much money on phone bills Well that's they they want me to call down there every so often I mean I told my dad li- Dad listen if you want to save money I won't call so often you know he goes we want to keep in touch so I doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you No Because it is more expensive that way Any any basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of And because it's considered a luxury in other countries Right Since it's his money anyway you know No I got money to pay that too So it's basically you know it's like it's not too much money and it's not too little money so I won't have to you know rush a letter to him or something because he really wants me to concentrate on my studies I'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering With those degrees Well I can I can work up here up to a year And hopefully get a job after that computer communications and data transmissions Right Yeah you know anywhere from local area networks metropolitan area networks you know all that and so well you have a family right And does does your wife work okay Yeah Okay Yeah And so and you have a monthly budget Right So you don't have any problem in overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that Yeah yeah Well then see that's that's one of the points which I don't see like I I don't give a lot of gifts during Christmas and I you know I don't wa- I don't like to give any at all because the thing is is that you know it's like if I want something I'll I'll ask somebody you know like like for Chr- for Christmas my roommate goes what do you want And I said I want a backpack You kno- no I told him yo- if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack Right because I I needed a backpack So he gave me a backpack and I I knew he needed an alarm clock So I bought him an alarm clock So the thing was that that Right but right but the thing is especially remember when I was down in Argentina it was to me it was ridiculous because you know you have to once a year you go out and you spend all this money on all these people and some you don't care about you know it's like Yeah And so but the thing is is that Yeah Yeah Well for example we had spring break now and I went skiing and I spent around like maybe two hundred dollars So but you know its like Yeah yeah Because it's like you know say you know it's like we were saying let's go eat out before spring break I go let's not go eat out before spring break Let's see how much money we have afterwards And if I felt like I spent way to much then I won't go out you know and so like my roommate went home I went skiing in over the Carolina Mountains which aren't anything but but it was you know it was I guess it was worth it You know it was a nice place Yeah yeah Yeah especially if you live on campus and you don't have a car you just go crazy So well let's see how long have we been talking here six minutes and a half Okay Yeah All right Well nice talking to you All right Bye-bye
