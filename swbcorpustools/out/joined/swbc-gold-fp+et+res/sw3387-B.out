The the first one is we need people in there that that understand numbers The numbers that are being thrown around when when we're talking in trillions of dollars which is an astronomical sum and and the people that are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means The elected people Yes Uh-huh Our our our Senate and Congress and and people that that deal everyday and and what's going to be done with those monies and don't really understand what that is or how a budget even works we need to elect people that are more or Well let's let's make them have a degree in economy or economics Well Yeah But but people that that know the value of a dollar that understand the value of a dollar and wh- in in in the the lobbyists needs them to be eliminated from Congress They don't make pragmatic decisions They make a decision based on consti- constituency instead of a decision based on what they really believe you know th- or they tack on this pork bellies and and do things that that are good for their area to pass something that is that is not good for the country I I definitely would Yeah Get rid of them Totally I I think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that and be registered with what they ever contribute But they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them That that's a conflict of interest as far as I'm concerned When you are talking again billions and trillions of dollars you're you're jeopardizing the future of the country for today That I I think to bring it in line you are going to have to have a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line You can't ease into it It took years and years to build up the momentum that's there now I I forget the figures on the interest rate but it's something like hundreds of thousands of dollars a second in interest Part of the problem is we don't loan from ourselves We we buy from intimate international banking That's why we have interest And and I I I really feel that that that is part of the problem that we we've let things get so out of control that that we don't want to put the brakes on them By by having a a a budget that is is feasible that is reasonable of course Sure And then add on to it You take the gross national income and you say our budget is X number of percent of this gross national income One thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax Across-the-board everyone no matter what pays a ten percent income tax  That's right Right No deductions You pay a ten percent income tax That's what you pay if you make forty million dollars then you're going to pay four million I- if you make forty dollars you're going to pay four dollars And and that's it I don't know that it would or wouldn't
