Well how about you are you an exercise fanatic Me either Do you Yeah Wonderful Uh-huh Way what is this That's the way to do it I'm kind of like you I've never really gotten into it it's just a it's just a chore you know and I finally decided one semester I'm in college and I'm taking night classes and I still don't have any of my P E classes and so one semester I thought okay that's what I'm going to do and that will get me where I'll have to do it you know and they were offering a a walking class where you you know you have to walk you know that like for every mile you walk and every so many minutes you get you get points you know and then you have to go in once a week and log your points so it's not like you can do the class like anytime you want you know and at the end of the semester you go back in and your like your final exam is a three mile walk And if you walk it in this many minutes you get an A this many minutes you get a B and I thought this will be an easy class and you know and I did it and I did it for a long time like about the middle of the semester I ended up having to have surgery on my foot and this has been a couple of years ago and you know I had I did that and I just ended up having to drop the class you know by the time the final came around I wasn't even where I could wear a shoe yet let alone walk three miles you know But that was the only time I have ever been able to like start an exercise program and really stick to it because then I had to I had to go every week and log in what I had walked and my teacher looked at it every week you know But other than that I just you know I kind of get in the mood every once in awhile say okay I'm going to start going to aerobics now you know and I'll go for like two weeks and go this is for the birds this is too much work Uh-huh Uh-huh Wow Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah But that's you're amazed at how much that adds up I was on Nutri Systems for a while and that is one of the things that they really stressed doing you know when you come to your Nutri System meeting don't park in the parking place outside the front door park at the other end you know I mean and they stretched stressed things like that too You know during when you're sitting watching T V at night during every commercial get up off the couch go to the living room and get a glass of water go to the bedroom and make the bed go do something but get up during every commercial And things like that And you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up you know just gives you a little more activity so especially when you're like us and don't really want to do it anyway Yeah Well I can't use that as an excuse because I didn't do it before I had mine either I've never been I just I'm more into you know sitting than I am so but you know I have found that with I have a two year old and I have found really though I'm kind of the opposite I'm more active now with him than I was before because now you know he'll "I want to go outside" and I'll go outside with him and we'll walk up and down the street and we'll go to the park and I'll run around with him and stuff like that that so I'm getting more you know more exercise that way than I ever did before I had him you know so I think I think that has helped a little bit I don't know Just chasing  him around the house you know will be plenty for you Right right You've kind of gotten out of that little stage there lucky you you're getting into even more interesting stages Uh-huh yeah yeah Same thing it repeats the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen How interesting I can hardly wait Yeah Right That that walkabout's a good program It really is you know when they first started it I I got all the information of course but just like everything else I was real gung ho with a friend of mine "Oh we're going to do this we're going to do this" and we did do it for a long time and then I started school you know and like two nights a week I was going to school and then the other two nights a week my husband worked so I had to pick Ryan up you know there's always an excuse you know to not do it so Yeah I'm sure I'm sure Yeah here to here here Yeah yeah to the mall to the movies to the friends to the Sounds like fun Well it was really good to talk to you Take care talk to you later
