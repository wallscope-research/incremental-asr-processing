Primarily with our local newspaper and T V I listen to the radio but not not like I did when I was working I am recently retired to that means I have a lot of time to watch the news on T V How do you gain your news <> Okay I see Well that's that is one of the handicaps with both T V and and radio If you're not available on the hour or half hour then you lose out on an awful lot Well what is your newspaper That is the WASHINGTON POST is that correct I have read that when we were in that area and it is a splendid newspaper So what more do we need to discuss tonight That seems like a very short one Well I can discuss a lot of the news that we have but I feel that that's not part of our responsibility So thank you for calling All right Good-bye
