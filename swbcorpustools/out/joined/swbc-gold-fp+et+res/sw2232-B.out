Well let me preface it I'm a I was a staff officer in Vietnam in sixty-nine and seventy and I'm in active reserve now so I'm probably not going to have the you think I would have it's I was an interesting in that I think that he gave the American people some a sense of the fact that that wars are really run by politicians I> It I are you old enough to remember the war Yeah Well December seventy-two was when we bombed North Vietnam and then they released the prisoners in early seventy-three in that in that time frame I think the the significant thing is is today did did you did you see Barbara Walters interview with Schwartzkopf Well wha- what's your perspective on it Yes Well well the difficulty I have is that are we our neighbor's keepers And this is what I find particularly difficult in that if we see injustice and weather it's in a you know Chicago   or + typo weather> whether or  + or  Dallas I I think if we see it you know we see John Wiley Price hollering injustice I think that's wrong Now the question is is was there injustice in Vietnam or was there injust in Iraq Kuwait typo injustice the difficult I point is is to where do we step in and and I think that we that's that's the part I have difficulty and the the other part is that the the when when your when your when your looking at Vietnam and you say well is fifty-eight thousand lives worth it 3 typos your> you're And I don't know that anything is worth fifty-eight thousand lives Well the other issue is is is how do you allow how how do you allow injustice Just like the the policeman in in Los Angeles how could how could could you stand there and watch them beat that guy If your brother or your sister were being beaten by the authorities do we step in Well In some cases we would and I I think that's what makes it so difficult Yeah But but the other the other difficulty is is that it's just if if you take the to to feed my sheep and the question is who are my sheep and the idea do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry Yes they did but I think the biggest difficulty is is that when your at an economy like South Vietnam well the then reality the the poor farmer the poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes your> you're and the question is who was he going to pay it to the communists are the all alleged democrats democratic formed government and I I think that's I think I think that's a little was a difficult part there and and I we didn't understand the culture We couldn't we had we had a a young lady that was fourteen that worked on our in the unit I was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old and and the people looked like children I mean you couldn't imagine that one would would would conceal a bomb and and do these kind of things I think socially it really destroyed a lot of the people that that went over and saw these people You just couldn't believe that they would that they would be mean and and and and drop bombs and kill people and then we would turn around and and nay palm them you know typo napalm if and I think there was a lot of a lot of tearing of emotions and I think that if anything that when he was saying the idea that we learned we l- we learned a lot from Vietnam now it was it was in general bad but and I don't know the problem is now I'm I'm concerned a little bit that now that the gulf war is on that we're going I think it was a good war and it was okay to go beat up on people and I think that I think we need to a little more justice at home I'm not sure how we get that wonder if there's a connection there but Well the difficulty is is if you look in the old test meat and in the numbers of places that the Lord went out and just simply struck down old test meat = Old Testament and that was part of the problem when they went into the promise land  should be promised land that they that they they didn't destroy everybody And and that that you know and you I think that's one of those things when we get to heaven we're going to ask God Why did you do it that way Yeah Well and I I and even if the even at the local level when somebody's assaulted what do you do turn the other cheek Yeah
