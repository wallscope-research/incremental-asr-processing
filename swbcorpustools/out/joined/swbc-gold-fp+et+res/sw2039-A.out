yes Yes very much As a matter of fact I prefer public television And I have particularly enjoy the English comedies and the English mysteries Yes Vociferously Yes Well unfortunately for us at least here in the United States we the only access we have to that of course is public television I'm I'm not a great television watcher in any respect but the watching what I do watch is usually news and whatever is on public television Any kind of I also am very fond of great performances in that regard But No no no as a matter of fact Turner Broadcasting has been broadcasting all of the James Bond movies every night this week so I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies this week Well they're showing LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment and it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven So No no that's true I was just thinking that today he did well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in his early movies Whereas Sean Connery has maintained the how would you ruddy look but needs slash yes Well you know he was when was it last year or year before last he was voted the sexiest actor in movies or something I mean the man is sixty-two years old But but otherwise you know we with P B S and so forth And I I particularly enjoy I don't know whether you've had a chance to watch it on P B S but the series YES MINISTER That was about a the Interior Minister it was a comedy the Interior Minister of in England with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I know Well I I I'm not much of a television watcher I I read as I said and quite a bit I read about two or three novels a week in addition to all the technical stuff What what do you do What kind of work do you do At T I I see Uh-huh Well the last two people who have called both worked for T I and I just wondered I think that's something we all ca- No no I work for G T E In Maryland yes I guess not How did I hear about it Well I work you know they are gathering a data base for voice processing And that's my field of work also So I I know the people at T I who are doing this and I heard about it so I called them and asked if I could participate And You know send in the forms et cetera and so forth We could go back to television shows Yes I have Well no That's you could interpret it that way I I think what they are trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably after the what was is it the King James Version when the committee did it wrote the translation that so much was lost in the translation particularly since most of the translations were in Greek Well for example In Greek there are seven different words for love Okay so you can have there's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one word for you know love of your father and that sort of thing So in as to those types of interpretations really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now and what it's at So that's you know you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true but there's too much historical fact involved just from the the histories that are were developed around that time that are available To deny that at least the majority of it is true So you know it depends on how you look at it You can look at it you know if you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true then you can very much look at it that way Yeah well Well you can interpret that the what the T V show in the same way that you can interpret the Bible So But as as far as that goes I we at least agree on what we enjoy But I don't know if there is there is a time limit on this so I think so too Let's just it's been very pleasant talking to you and have a good evening Good night
