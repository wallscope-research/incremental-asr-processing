So what do you think Yeah really So they have n- I didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas that's great because they don't have it in Florida In New York they have it I mean you know like I say I'm in New York and we have a state tax as well So that just cuts even more Right I I think that I I mean I wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place You know y- you don't see it going to any place where it belongs I think  if it were to be if it were to be if it were to be + hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the ro- seems to me that the "hold on" should be a separate slash unit marked 'ad' and shouldn't continue into B15 If if it were to be  spent in the right way I think I wouldn't be so upset about it see B13 note but given that it that it's not spent properly I think it's a major problem Uh-huh <> Well that's certainly true Well what is it they were just talking about sort of middle income you know how how middle income people what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction and after but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something I think tha- so they want to you know try an- I think they're trying I think tha- I think that most of the politicians understand this They just don't they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing Right Uh-huh I agree I agree Right exactly and then and then I'm I'm just not sure if I see you know if I see it going like I say to the right places I mean it'd be it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older You know but I'm not convinced that's a- tha- that Social Security is doing as well as it should  and you know and and and and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty-five to ninety percent of them who don't need it But I mean the real people who really need it you know should be getting it but instead I think it's going to the wrong places You think so I know and that scares the hell out of me Yeah Yeah I don't I don't well becau- because they're the ones who make the laws seems like a slash unit to me So who's going to yell at them you know should be an independent slash unit See B39 utt3 it'd be nice if we sort of as one band together and and and an performed a citizens arrest I guess To see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but I don't know if we can do that or not Uh-huh I agree I agree But yeah like like you said I wonder you know if if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process and I wonder if it'll ever be a change process I sort of I sort of get discouraged when I think about all the things that I think are wrong You know all those things that really could be changed that aren't you know that that aren't And tax is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list So I don't kno- I I I have no idea what to do about it Yeah Right We don't I mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another Right I've never quite understood that I've never you know even though I I've never been sort of politically minded but it's never been clear to me as to sort of you know how Congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas when clearly their constituency doe- doesn't back them up on anything you know And often times that will happen Right Right They do forget it's true coul- because everybody think of what happens is whenever the politici- whenever th- the one who made that supposed mistake turns around and his his or her opponent can say well look they did this And they can turn around and say well my opponent did this So it becomes a general battle of the w- sort of the election of the lesser of two evils I think so I don't know I just I'm unhappy with it but And well I'm I'm sort of semifortunate right now I'm a graduate student so I don't make that much and what I make isn't taxed very highly because I'm still in school But  it's my my my wife has a real job and you know when I get her job you know we we look at her paycheck I'm just floored when I see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep Especially around bonus time Bonus she no my my wife does My wi- I don- no graduate students don't get bonuses We're lucky to get paychecks the way I figure My my wife is taxed on her bonus as well and that's a that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually I mean her bonus isn't that much but they tax it as I I guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something So she gets destroyed on her bonus check So she works with  in in in sales So a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses Yes well yeah she's not entirely sales so it isn't it isn't as lucrative as one would hope but it it keeps us supported temporarily until I can get a real salary and then get taxed more So I don't know I d- I guess I guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it and hope that it gets better Same here tough topic so I beli- I I I do agree with you most most wholeheartedly It's been a pleasure talking with you Thanks for call You too Bye-bye
