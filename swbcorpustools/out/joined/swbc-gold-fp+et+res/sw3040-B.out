yeah I I think so I I'm I think I'm I think I'm a little out of the ordinary in that that I I I think I'm more worried about the deficit the national deficit than than a lot of other people are and think that we need to we need to either raise our taxes or or cutback on something and I don't know what to cutback on to to get to get that to get that settled And and and I know I'm a real a real out of it in terms of taxes so I'm no- I'm think that the we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that for Texas and and Yeah I think so Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah Yeah yeah Yeah now I'm I we'd when we moved to R- Richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the for the schools And and realizing that that that that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to to go for that because we supported the Yeah Yeah Yeah I think that's right Yeah I I don't I don't know about that I I I see Okay No Yeah well that that that would be true That would be true But  Yeah and and even if it is isn't going to provide you with any any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your your home to a business for instance you know Yeah Yeah And Yeah and the other thing is that when it when it's the public transportation is established that early on then then the business business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that Whereas in in in Dallas here we've we've got those patterns were well established before before we really tried to tried to do the DART And for instance all the all the the office buildings and stuff that are out here in in north Dallas as opposed to downtown to try to to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the the metroplex to to both those centers of of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area You know like New York does yeah Yeah Yeah Right right Yeah yeah Yeah Yeah right Yep Yeah Yeah Yeah A little bit much yeah Yep Yep the c- Yeah I th- I think so I think that will probably do it so Good enough Bye
