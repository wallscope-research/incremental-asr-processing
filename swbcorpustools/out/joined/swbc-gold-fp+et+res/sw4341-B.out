Well I think that in some cases it is warranted And I don't I think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not I mean I mean I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer or Well for some things I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood I mean you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again And I don't think that that rehabilitation is effective But then you know I think that that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment You know just like for example you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them and I don't think that would really warrant capital punishment it is to a certain extent but I think I don't know because I think in s- and it just would depend upon the circumstances and and the extent of the abuse and and if another alternative was available Well I think that would be kind of drastic punishment And But one thing I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance sh- should be investigated But like I said if if someone is is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society But And a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison Well I know in North Carolina we do have capital punishment And I'm in I'm from South Carolina
