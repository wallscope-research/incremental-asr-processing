So are you a freshwater or Freshwater Uh-huh Most of my fishing has been in the saltwater mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish and I have caught one or two small sharks and yes Put them back No no no I love shark steak but the ones I caught were never large enough to really do anything Is there a limit I have no idea I know I my home is in Pensacola Florida so it's they do a lot of shark fishing in that you know in the gulf and there's a certain period of time during the year they have all along the gulf coast from I guess from Galveston to Mayport they have shark tournaments and you know there's part either as part of or separate from the bill fishing tournaments they usually have so I have not done much freshwater fishing for you know lake lake fishing for bass and so forth but maybe some what they call brim and those sorts of things but nothing I think I've been trout fishing once I've never fly fished Have you fly fished I've tried it once yes a friend of mine no I could never get the hang of it Uh-huh I usually ended snagging my fishing partners or the trees along the bank Yes Almost got an owl once But no no no no I used when I was working in Florida I used to do a lot of surf fishing mostly for relaxation you know there are people who fish and then there are people who catch Well I'm a fisher That's right I've never caught that much but and occasionally we'd go out on a you know full day trip you know three or four other people and do either again bottom fishing or or for grouper or I used to catch you know I've caught a few worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth What about you you a Uh-huh yes The last time I went bass fishing I was with my daughter a friend of hers and well a friend of mine and his daughter We I was the only one who did not catch a single fish my daughter caught fish his daughter caught fish he caught fish I did not even I did not even I have been I was out on a party boat a few years ago and we we were grouper fishing or you know actually we were snapper fishing Everyone on the boat was catching snapper snappers except guess who I ca- I That's right I would go from one side of the boat to the other and the the party boat captain could not understand you know he even even he started baiting my hook and holding holding the the fishing rod Right and it was it was really really really bad I as I said I am a fisher I'm not a catcher But I enjoy it though I don't really get out as much as I as I would like too And they do of course you know here in we're only just a few not a few minutes we're you know forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in Maryland and they do a lot of fishing there Of course what I used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or or oy- for oysters And that I was able to do when I could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom That right Uh-huh Uh-huh  Uh-huh Uh-huh Well we used to I guess the weirdest thing I've ever caught is in some of the inlets and the rivers around Delaware They have a fish that's called an oyster cracker I don't know if you've ever heard of it and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually use their teeth to open oysters Uh-huh and this is the ugliest fish I have ever seen and I mean and they come in all si- you know I've I've caught them from you know three or four inches long up to I guess the largest one I ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things just terrible No no They just they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them Uh-huh Well the first time I went surf fishing was in and I threw my line out and the first thing I caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot and a half or two feet long and scared me to death I had never seen anything and then I was fi- fished for another half hour or forty-five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth and then I felt something relatively heavy and I thought really here I'm really going to get one And I
