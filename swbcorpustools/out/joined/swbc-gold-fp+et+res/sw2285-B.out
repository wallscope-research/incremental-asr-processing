Uh-huh Uh-huh Right yeah well when we lived in San Antonio I grew up around San Antonio and it's always been a very large city and increasingly growing It's has kind of the split population there's a lot of retired military individuals that live there and then there's a very large Hispanic population there And the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is Hispanic gang crime in the city and that has been the worse thing that we've seen happening the majority of the actual gang crimes like the pat- the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies rape and car crime There's a very large or very high percentage of car theft And San An- San Antonio's not far from the border to Mexico so a lot of the cars go to you know shops and they take them apart and a lot of them go over the border especially like Mercedes A lot of those those in the the Z the Z cars the Datsun cars end up over the border and very much so very much so in fact for a while there they had downtown if you were to come to a stop light they had a rash of where people were when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up So now ever since then when you drive into the city most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car until they get down there and once you've reached the the river walk area which is the tourist area it's usually pretty safe during the day if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys and you know or alone If you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the river patrol cops it's very nice But at at evening again you they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice but you don't want to get off the beaten track there's a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight And so you don't want to get caught in the parking garage alone Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh It's just so sad you know it is just really so sad you know it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more in San Antonio I don't know what the answer is Education I think is a lot of it so many of the kids are drop outs there's a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives They they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels I think education helps a little bit there then again I don't know really what steps there are that they Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh that's good that sounds like they've got a lot going on there Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah I don't know how you combat that I I don't know where you start or with a lot of these kids so many of them all they see is just the gangs and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh And I don't know how you combat that I rea- I don't know what the answer is to that problem you know Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah And what do those kids do they get it at school and come home what do they do then I I feel I feel for them I don't know how to make it better for them or you know because it they can't remove themselves they can't just leave and say okay well it's not acceptable I'm leaving the big city Mom and I'm I'm going off you know when they're ten they have to live in it and Uh-huh Right I think so and Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah Yeah Uh-huh no in San Antonio it was like every day it was just a matter of who was shot that night Uh-huh yeah but But there's a lot of them it's very prevalent a lot of the crime is very prevalent Uh-huh very much When we moved here to Monterrey it was a big change because it's such a small community we're just above Carmel and there's hardly most everybody seems pretty well employed around here and those that aren't there's Celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive which is mostly migrant workers and there's a lot of crime there migrant Hispanic farm workers people that are down and out and they all seem to congregate in Celinas not so much here in Monterrey So it's it's pretty quiet You know we walk the streets at night and people run in the park and you know you're just have your normal smarts about you then you really don't have to worry or Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh I didn't know that about Burlington I'll have to keep that in mind
