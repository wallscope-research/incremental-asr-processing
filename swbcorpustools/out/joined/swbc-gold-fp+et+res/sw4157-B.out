Um I lived I lived in Sweden for two years And in Sweden they have socialized medicine And so I saw some of the good and also I saw some of the bad that results from such a program Uh some of the some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care So it's a very it's a very uh comfortable I mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that you know there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life Um the bad was more apparent I think at least for me because I think it affected people's lives on in a way that you could see One one thing that I noticed is it's very very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden Because it's treated as a disease Now I don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine but uh if you're if you're alcoholic then you're treated as if you're on disability long-term disability and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that Also um another thing that that I noticed that was very strange I was uh I would go down all these uh uh I remember this one row of houses and they were uh row houses or townhouses all connected together so it was like lower middle-class housing Well it would be lower middle-class housing here It's probably middle-class housing there Um and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these and there was a doctor that lived in one of these The one guy was a doctor and one was a taxi driver and so their their incomes were about the same Whereas here there is a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward And that that didn't exist in Sweden And uh overall I gue- their their health care suffered fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower and it was it was less professional and it was treated more like a like a taxi driver type job then a then a doctor type job Right You don't think it's abnormal Oh I see You're not saying it's right you're just saying it's common Yes
