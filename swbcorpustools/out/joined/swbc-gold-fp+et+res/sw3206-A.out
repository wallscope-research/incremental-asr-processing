Yeah are you there Okay Do you know the question for today And what is your feeling Do you think this is vital important Okay Do you I It I have worked in some campaigns and it's the most discouraging thing in the world I'm originally from Oklahoma and up there if they miss three elections then they have to reregister And I have often wondered if if maybe that would help the situation I don't know Well can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people that's all right Well I'm I'm not sur- the only thing is if they don't vote they have no right to complain It is I don't know why we are so complacent but I'm going to vote each time Right or wrong I'm going to cast a ballot and then if I'm unhappy with it I have the right to express my opinion So there was something else I was going to and I'm like you I've just lost a train of thought that I had But they have been more little more s- effective in Oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it No three You have to lo- you have to skip three And of course those can be they can be a long time apart but Of course what do you think and this is not one of our questions but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting Okay I'm sure all over the State of Texas now you have three weeks to go for absentee balloting And you don't have to h- be sick out of town or anything They there is no excuse Anyone can go and vote Do you But that is an excuse and that would I could live with But this idea of anyone wel- I ju- I am so bitterly opposed to this If you're busy that has always been a legitimate excuse If you are incapacitated ill health but to have the expense of let's see They have five six people at my polling place They can come from all over the city and I don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this Yes I know But is there is every list checked as thoroughly as a you know We back in when I lived
