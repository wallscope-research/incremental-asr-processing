Do you think that there's any way that or do you think there's too much crime now I mean I guess any crime is too much but It's out of control Really I would not of okay I would not have guessed that in Seattle Yeah You know Yeah I wonder I mean I wonder what what really is the answer I mean it seems like our our the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system Yeah But but the problem is is that we we only have but so much room and we we try to put aside in the warehouse and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes and So it's I get the feeling that a lot of people have I'm not convinced that I have see I mean my mom taught English as a second language and and she was dealing mostly with people that were were in on drug crimes and Yes In a in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia And the problem she had was not with the inmates at all The the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison I mean It was it was I mean they they put her I mean I didn't obviously I didn't see the classroom and hopefully never will but they they put her at the end of a hallway there were no other classes going on at the time and they refused to let her wear a body al- a body alarm Which and I don't know exactly what that is but I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and and really annoy a lot of people But you know No she didn't She didn't she she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates and then later on the the administration kept getting worse and she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't she didn't feel quite as comfortable around But well she had decided that it was when we came back to the States she decided that it was too she didn't feel that public schools were s- were safe so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison But Yeah But but the point that was that it you know you said that perhaps people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible and and I'm I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in that run the system have given up on it  But getting I mean well see I always have problems because because I can never decide whether or not I'm I'm supposed to be a conservative or or a liberal but But I keep I keep thinking that there's got to be some way that that a lot of this is circumstances I mean I can't help but wonder if if I grew up without a father on the streets and with like little or no money wouldn't wouldn't I be in prison at this point I mean I don't know We've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't get onto the program I don't I don't remember the the gentleman's name but the the the mayor of Baltimore is a is a Rhodes Scholar and what he Well what he wants to do is take all the money that he gets for drug enforcement and use it for drug education And basically just just attack the problem at the demand side Stop trying to attack supply because which which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't I mean Switzerland tried the the grand experiment and you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park and
