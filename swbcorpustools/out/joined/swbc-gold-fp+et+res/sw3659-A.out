Set You you got the topic right Okay well where in Dallas are you okay So you do re- do recycling there Uh-huh Uh-huh Are they going to later do you know Uh-huh  Well I'm I'm in Dallas proper in the city of Dallas and I know they do have you know a pilot program going on but it's not here So they're not picking up anything So I mean we we collect everything We've got all these boxes in our garage for you know green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything Well there's there's a couple places Unfortunately we can't find a place that will take everything there's a lot of places to take like the plastic shopping bags like most of the grocery stores And there's a Wal-Mart nearby that takes almost everything I can't remember what it is they don't take And the library will take glass So we end up you know on the weekend we pack it all in the car and and as we go places we wait we can drop the glass off you know Drop things off one at a time but and it's kind of disappointing I mean I would even be happy if they just had one you know one place where you could do everything You know it would still be more convenient than what we have now  Where is that Oh I'm pretty far north I'm not I'm I'm I'm just I'm north of Addison actually So I'm I'm really I'm s- I'm in Dallas but only technically Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I've seen those Yeah Yeah Well you get something  We used to do that but again that's another stop and it doesn't take plastic bags and and all that sort of thing but I think that you know I heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is and so hopefully they'll do it soon That would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week and where I grew up we only had one a week and that was certainly sufficient So if they just do one of them will be trash and the alternate time would be recyclables that would be great So Uh-huh Oh  Right Yeah Do you have to sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that that sort of thing or do they take the whole thing okay Uh-huh Let me guess you work at T I right So do I Yeah  Yeah Yeah Well and they take cans now too Which is great Well our department used to collect the cans anyway for the Christmas tree project And In fact we got this past year we got all of our money for the Christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year And it worked out really well Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Because we would get it
