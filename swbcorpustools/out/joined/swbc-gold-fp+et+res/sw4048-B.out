pretty good pretty good So we're talking about drug testing in the work place listen Yeah we have random drug testing at in my business but I've never been never had to do it Yeah yeah they started that about a year ago and I think it's mostly for the the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff But they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking drinking beer and stuff at lunch time at least that's Pardon Yeah yeah they they they'll check for alcohol No once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you're sort of stuck into checking for the whole the whole thing Yeah it's a I'm in the oil business Yeah Yeah I work in the office so it's pretty pretty safe environment Uh-huh uh-huh Well that sounds like kind of an important job to be straight on Yeah yeah well I I I agree I think that you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in in high risk industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff You know if it's as long as it's not abused you know random you know as long as it's random and and the individual's rights are are protected I don't have that big a problem with it Well see this is it this is where I start having my problems with my company I work for a private company and and the policy is something like see if I can re- state this correctly now If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling But if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired So it you know it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos Yeah really it's one of those things that you read once and then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget about it Yeah Yeah yeah our company's a little tougher on the second chance I mean if if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to you know go out of the way I think a little bit more to to help you get help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job But when you're not when you're a private company the rules don't always apply Well it's it's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment and you know it's not I guess I ha- haven't run into anybody that's that's had a problem that's that's been a problem so I gue- you know I guess it works much like well shoot like any lottery I mean everybody's got an equal chance to get picked So I'd rather have that than you know say well this week the As and Bs are going to be in and next week Cs and Ds are going to come in Yeah right right Yeah Well especially around you know equipment machinery and stuff You know I've I've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case I don't remember to tell you the truth I don't think they do well they must I mean gee whiz That just shows you how much I've been paying attention because I I really don't know I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask Well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far there was a company in Houston that they did an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of it was not only drugs
