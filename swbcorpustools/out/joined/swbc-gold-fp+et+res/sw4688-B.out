Uh-huh That sounds about right Uh-huh Right  Well it's kind of difficult for me Because right now like most teachers I'm laid off and so I spend most you know I substitute a lot So it's a lot it's very hard on a nonfixed income because I don't know how many days I'm going to be called in and whether I am or not to try to keep track of finances And but I know how much I have to bring in a month And that's about it That's about as far as we go And then anything extra is you know more or less split up between all of us And just thrown in the kitty more or less for a rainy day no I'm a single mother I have three children So right now we're on we get f- you know aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it And my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support So right now I know what I'm getting from the state and I have to balance more or less what I get from the state with my bills and you know try to work as many days as possible Any time they call me in But I still have to figure out If I work too many days then I lose all my state aid and if I don't work enough days then I don't get enough to meet the bills and it's like a juggling act every single month Like this week I've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation So you know the four days before they only have a four day week and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in They don't like to be absent before a vacation But we're shopping around as far as well I'm shopping around as far as trying to get that's why I'm doing this to get some extra money And getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts My kids are in Boy Scouts so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me So it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit But you know we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul I guess we're in the situation that a lot of am- middle-class Americans are in my Lord Really Uh-huh Oh Sure Right Uh-huh Definitely yes we do And we try to you know I keep track of every penny And more or less enter it in Every single day I'm at the computer And it's like okay what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month What hasn't come in yet you know
