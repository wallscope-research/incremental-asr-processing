Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I think I agree with that very much I do you Do you think a lot of people when they are listening to a trial put themselves in a position like that and say I would never do something like that and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done Uh-huh I never have either Is there a reason why you have never Uh-huh My husband works as a police man so I always assumed that that was why I was never called Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh do they have such a thing now as a six man jury Somebody told me the other day that there is what they call a six man jury and I had never heard of such thing and I wondered if it was true I never had either but I just wondered another question was should a criminal case should the jury be unanimous on their decision and that I wasn't sure on either whether it should be unanimous or not That would mean they all would have to decide one way or the other Uh-huh Yeah yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Bring some of these things out Uh-huh apparently there are I I I since my husband worked as a policeman I can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of I have I still have a little bit of a problem with that but I would suppose there are circumstances you're in the wrong place at the right time or know the wrong person at the right time Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh uh-huh They still found him guilty When people said he was at work Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah for heaven's sake So there's nine years of that man's life gone Uh-huh No huh-uh Yeah I guess that's where a lot of the problem lies we're we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people the one's that are on trial And And we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to because I bet they still say our system is the best in the world Yeah it's the best one that exists I guess I think a lot of people are I think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country Uh-huh Yeah That bad I wouldn't like it but I don't know if I'd go that far Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah well I think pride in our country and our flag is so important It's important in so many facets of our lives And I I feel like if they don't people don't like what our flag stands for they're welcome to go some place else There's nobody holding them here Right They'd soon be back I'm sure Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I don't know about the judge making the decision if that's do you think that's good you know like if a jury Uh-huh Make a recommendation Do they sometimes make a recommendation That's what I was thinking they they sometimes do And they recommend Yeah And then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen Yeah Uh-huh Well I think that's where a lot of people think boy they're getting put away for a long time but actually their chance course when a lot of times when they come up for parole they're denied It depends on you know what they're what they'd been guilty of and a lot of different things I guess Uh-huh A lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do And there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh I always thought there was there was wrong it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody It seemed like there sometimes there's not a good the balance isn't right It doesn't make sense Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah Yeah right So let's put up with it I guess Improve it if we can if we ever get a chance So Well it's been nice talking to you Jack and I hope you have a real good day and week I hope not You too Bye-bye
