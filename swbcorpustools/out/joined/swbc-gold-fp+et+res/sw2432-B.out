Well I just got back from taking my little girl to her Brownie meeting and then we had this whole can a bag filled full of cans and they've been recycling at their school Well she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow But they were filled with beer cans and I hated to take a big old sack I mean one time I mean like a lawn bag full of them Like I no we'll just taking them up there and put them in the bins anyway They had tickets at their school that they recycle either newspapers or cans and I think that's all <> Okay and they're taking the money that they earn to plant trees Yeah and they've got their bins that stay there and they've decorated real cute you know with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff So they're getting into it I don't know what they get for the tickets though <> What do you get for the tickets if you bring stuff the class that gets the most tickets gets a party It's not bad yeah Uh-huh So in each of the dorms you have a place for that That's really good For the dorm and who decides what you do with it And what do they do with it Uh-huh Well I graduated from college in nineteen seventy-two And we were just not aware that this was a problem that we ever would need to recycle Of course you just threw it away So a little different And I wanted to do this thing that you can get through Target to recycle I had my school do it but my principal said since we're doing this thing called Operation Desert Shield we're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all that The whole school you know it was just this big project she didn't want to get into that And I could do it in the center and I just never got around to it But it's like a club you know about that A little boy that had died of leukemia I think and he had started this save the environment club And his mother is carrying this on And you can get the information to set it up you know and join you don't have to join it as a group or anything I don't guess But you could start your own anyway Get a pamphlet Do you all have Target stores up there No That's a department store Kind of like K Mart except it's a little better than what K Mart sells I think So you're not pick- you're not having it picked up at your houses or anything  Now in some of the towns around us they're already picking up the newspapers Well they're doing that here too now that I think about it <> Once every so many weeks and you have to pull out all the slicks and you have to wrap them up with string And I think that's all they're picking up But you know like in Minnesota they've got their bins where you put plastics and your bottles Yeah because my brother-in-law lives in Minnesota and they're are just nice plastic bins and you fill them up and put them out with your other trash and they pick them up Do you all have can banks No <> I sus- a big old bin and you just feed your cans slowly into the slot and your money comes out you know every once in a while for however much poundage you've got And if you keep feeding it until the light goes off And you get instant cash But they had one that I was putting my stuff in and I went to take some today and it was gone I don't know But I located another one today on the way to work But they don't give you for the other Uh-huh Well they're certain places you know where down there you can take your leaded cans But I don't know where they are They publish it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it I don't know I'm trying but I just can't recycle everything I'm not that dedicated But Me too If they would I know we're saving our grocery bags now Yeah they're taking those up You can take them to the stores <> like Kroger's doing it And I think Skaggs Do you have those up there And we they're taking our milk cartons and our plastic coke bottles there too So That's pretty good isn't it It sounds like it you'd think you would be You mean where you sack your own groceries  And I don't want to go with those canvas bags right now I'm sorry I'm not that European But you know they do that like I went to Europe nineteen seventy-three And you know they go all the time It's like they would go almost every day to the store And they had their little bags way back then and fill it up And they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators That's why They couldn't put anything in it hardly But Well what are you going to do when you get out of college Well that's why I did what I did I went into teaching Here in Texas it's a real mess right now definitely There's no Let's see we've had the funding we've run out of money We've frozen the money Right And they had until the fifteenth of April to come up some formula that would be more equitable to different districts according to finances because the poor districts were getting less money so not as good an education Right And now they're trying to take some money away from the richer districts like the one that I'm in in Dallas and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable And if they can't come up with something by the fifteenth then the state's supposed to decide the courts I think they're maybe going to give us a state income tax Do you have one I'm not looking forward to it but something's got to be done Well it's going to hit us And I don't know did- doesn't seem like it work to take it away when we're using it But maybe I know we're not using it so wisely We have too many administrators in some of these big districts But other than that Well can you think of anything else we need to talk about Me either Anything else What about people from Pennsylvania What do they think about Texans Uh-huh Have you thought about that Probably a lot more civilized more refined than a lot of the people would be down here I would hope so I mean you've been together a little bit longer than we have No Well I've never well let's see I think I have too been to Pennsylvania Gettysburg Yeah we went up there Now that I think about it On one of our long trips we take off on Shboom <> What are you saying Holly <> my little girl is in the second grade told me to tell you that Shboom means good-bye in the Israeli language <> is what you say it is Holly In Israel in Israel <> See she's got this little girl from Israel in her classroom that she's befriended So she's into this Huh-uh You know we've had a lot of the Jewish people
