a lot of companies now are are using drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to to root out the the either elementary or intermediate or advanced drug users And I know the the government is you know gives drug tests an- to all new entrants all new appli- applicants coming into government And and I quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it I I'm I guess I'm not a good civil libertarian And and I I feel as though that you know that if you you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background Of course we're we're being involved in my organization we we have deep background checks and and so but but sometimes you know drug use can can escape that And I have absolutely no compunction about using any and all means to to you know work out figure out who has a drug program or who has a drug problem and and putting that guy into into therapy to whatever it is to to you know break this activity Of course if he's fallen in love with drugs and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful then maybe there is no hope What's your feeling Uh-huh Well I think the dr- the laws on the first morphine laws were were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that Yeah Well the thing of it is the the tha- tha- that that is in in many respects you know just just I think an over simplification I I think there th- th- th- there's so much criminal activity that people go into to to support drug habits Yeah You know they they support drug habits with with you know with things like you know burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that yeah I I I must admit that Yeah Yeah I I must admit that the production costs of of these drugs are are zippo compared to the street market costs and and the costs to society yeah But I I I I think that that the that you know the being in law enforcement you know th- th- th- they I I probably have a kind of a draconian Philistine attitude toward it And but but the I I really feel as though the interdiction effort is is as soon as you you get rid of one goon that's that's that's involved in drugs and tha- Yeah and then another another one will jump up But we we see Yeah A- a- as soon as we wind up you know for well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand but but people want to get get stoned and I I don't see that Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh
