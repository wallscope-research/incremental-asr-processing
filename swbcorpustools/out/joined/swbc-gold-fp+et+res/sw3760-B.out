Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that is pretty impressive to have three books going yeah And what what kind of books do you read yeah do you like those detective stories well that is interesting Actually I like to read also but usually fall into one or two categories either true science fiction or fantasy on the one hand or highly technical Yeah Yeah kind of one or the other I do Yes Yeah and I am a computer scientist But I have a lot of other hobbies Well yeah I am kind of I guess what you would call it a project person Yeah and I love like I have a shop and when things break around the house I always try to fix them myself and so hobby it's its' funny from the one stand point it is work But it is a hobby too that I enjoy to do To find broken Well essentially anything you find in a house a stove or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or chipped tile on the floor I mean just anything Well it it is not anything elaborate It is just a work bench and a gazillion tools But enough that again for anything in the house I could probably Right And in the car I guess the car too And so I think I probably would consider that a hobby Although sometimes it gets to be excessive Yeah I Right Yeah I think it it not only can it be fun but it can certainly help your finances So do you have any art how do I say it creative or artistic hobbies yeah well that's good Yeah Well I don't necessarily either I can plink out a song or two on a piano and I can I don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art I guess graphic arts is that what they call it I can't do any of that but sweat shirts is certainly impressive Uh-huh yeah yeah Uh-huh I see Well that is neat I guess you could consider that a hobby Do you do you cook for a hobby or do you That's not something you I understand that Yeah Right Yeah But I think that still borders on hobby Probably the other thing I do which I am sure will sound horrible to you but is I program for fun on the computer So I have little projects little computer projects going on that I consider hobbies But drive my wife crazy I do yes In fact there is actually several of them here right now Not all of them being mine Yeah I wonder if you can construe raising children as being a hobby Uh-huh
