Well I think we need to do more I mean I know I need to do more They have programs around where you can reach the they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up But I have a hard time of being able of separating you know having a place separating my trash and get all the cans from the paper and you know I just haven't gotten that dedicated yet So Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah well I don't I don't get the paper every day but you know I get it on I try to buy you know the early edition for the coupons you know the Sunday edition So But then I just you know bundle it up and put it on the front you know the front walk ev- you know every Monday or every other Monday and have them pick that up but that's the extent of what I've done I'd like to be able to do more The problem is with a lot of it is you have to go you know it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it you know it's not always convenient to do it Yeah I'm not exactly sure where the you know the can thing is but you know sometimes it's just so seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them Uh-huh Uh-huh Do those can crushers work good Uh-huh Yeah because those things I think would just snap you know Oh I'd have to check into something like that because I mean we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here you know but you know occasionally we have some around but you know for other kind of cans just to it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that don't they Yeah so I don't know I don't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that but I need to look into it more you know it's you know it sometimes even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper you know they won't take paper that's shiny Yeah so does my husband yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I don't know what you know I haven't I'm sure they're probably doing that here some Uh-huh I think it's necessary I I like it you know it makes I think it's good that you see these you know like boxes cereal they're now starting to make them you know the packages out of recycled paper and And I've bought you know I've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper and I think they're just fine Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I think we're getting becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more So No no the office Yeah it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere Yeah <> Girls put that away Now Yeah I just wish it was a little more conv- convenient to do you know seems like you're so busy anyway and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about So I think if you know the cities locally you know they'd get more programs going so that you could do that it'd make it a lot easier So Yeah yeah get the kids interested in it too Yeah Uh-huh That's right That's right who does You know people don't have room for that kind of stuff No and in Texas they're just get things like that they just get bugs in them So So you don't That's right so I'm pretty lazy about it right now Everything goes into one thing and goes out to the You know pick it up So Uh-huh Well I need to get get better at it So Yeah that's right that's right That's true That's right Huh Well thank you for calling I Okay take care Bye-bye
