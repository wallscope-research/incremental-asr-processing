gee I don't I mean I I guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust you know they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that So I believe them but I'm not a chemist I don't really know I grew up in Los Angeles and have felt like I was victimized by air pollution I understand it very well and in fact I was a private pilot there and I can remember very etched etched clearly in my mind flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down and and really being unbelieving at what looked like a it just looked liked peanut butter Thick and brown and so on This was quite a few years ago This was in the nineteen sixties People say that it is somewhat better Right  So did it burn coal Yeah  Yeah Yeah I don't I don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals maybe just take good care of our cars and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing apart from that I I don't know what we can do as individuals What do you think we can do Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah I guess I'm I'm to the point where I'm cynical enough that I really don't believe anything will happen unless unless there's something economically justifiable about it And in the case of air pollution it simply might turn out at some point down the road to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems and everything else that we'll spend the money that's necessary to to get rid of the source of it Yeah People also have to realize they can't have their cake and eat it So if you don't want to burn coal for power how about nucle- nuclear energy Well we don't want that either How about investing in the sun Well nobody wants to pay twenty-five cents a kilowatt hour I don't think I probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it yes yes yes Yes certainly yes Yeah There's not really a lot here in Raleigh once in a while we'll get some I think it kind of washes down from from your area Linda That's what they that's what they Yeah Yeah yeah that's what they say but it's it's not it's not very usual and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah Yeah Right I think we've given them about seven minutes according to my watch and I enjoyed the conversation Bye
