Okay do do you have a home or apartment Okay do you have to do a lot of upkeep Uh-huh Okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah uh-huh Well that's nice I wish I could say that Ours is pretty small too but it it takes about an hour with the two of us working to you know do the bushes and all of that sort of thing the worst part is controlling the weeds Which I hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and because like we have a dog and and you know he's going to be out in the yard and who knows who he eats out there But we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway what else I get to put out all the Christmas lights out there and all that sort of thing No okay Well if they if they go up like one year we did the edge of the house all the way up on the roof and I I went up on the roof once and I'll never do it again I decided I was afraid So this year he got lazy so I said fine I'll put some on the bushes And that's about it that's all it gets Uh-huh Uh-huh wow no Yeah Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh  no But you still have to pay for it though even though they're not going to do it is it real expensive gosh my goodness Yeah Well do do they do other things for you all Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh  But you knew when you moved in you'd have to pay that didn't you Oh Yeah I don't know either That's interesting Uh-huh Now do at a do things like plant bushes and trees okay So there is like no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that Uh-huh Yeah when we moved into our house I just hated the bushes they had I I ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back And put new ones out front But that was a lot of work Took me a long time Uh-huh Yeah and then then we put in a sprinkler system and We won't go through that again I will pay someone to do it it took so long Because my husband was you know digging the trenches because he didn't want to get a trencher you know there is a machine that will do it Because you know there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it And I guess that costs you an absolute fortune By hand Yeah but it works great now that we've got it Yeah it's nice Yeah well we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble you know you have to keep the the area moist around the house or it makes it worse so we had an incentive there to do that
