Well ourselves we have I guess never had to look for child care Our kids are now fourteen and eighteen But and so you know you go back those many years and we didn't do it very much We I guess we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at two family income at the time And our kids were older But I've had to deal with you know friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing so it my involvement hasn't been direct but still have been you know certainly exposed to criteria people are using How about yourself Right Right Right Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I I kind of think that you know some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care But even you know here I guess we have in one sense two forms of child care There's where individuals will in one primarily babysit children in their own home And that will be groups of anywhere <> from one or two to maybe seven or eight children And then otherwise there will be the majority are co-operative day-cares people form a co-op and parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours Frequently they will hire staff to be at the day-care and the emphasis is primarily someplace for the children to be But at the same time there's some fairly good training programs and and some of them formal two year programs so that you know there is some definite creative play good social interaction that kind of thing Yeah Yeah You know we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here and I guess you know it are it's typically whether it's been child care in a home or in a larger situation where actually it's more of an institution And you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children and it's not and it's more of a group home rather than actually day-care s- type of facility
