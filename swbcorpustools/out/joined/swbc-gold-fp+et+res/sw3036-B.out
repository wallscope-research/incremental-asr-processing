Well I could pick country music answered as if to a qw As I've gotten older I've started listening more to the words of music and to the softer melodies Not originally Georgia If you had to pick one what would you choose Well I understand what you're saying I think if you would listen to it a little you would discover that it has a lot of roots from the both from the classics and from some of the rock and roll of the era that that we both lived through <> Well there's some joy in it also But mostly it it just tells a story about life I don't know I'm not all that familiar with her work Well I kind of like I like groups like the Statler Brothers And <> the Judds certainly Reba McIntire is a little too country for me That's true yes That's certainly where her roots are Very much so That's true Well it's just difficult for me to believe that anybody's ever going to make a a record of the rap songs of the eighties Yeah <> That's true Yeah <> Right Of course Well the big key is that I think you've already stated that all music is rooted in the classics and it has grown from there Well listen I have to run I hate to cut 2 slash units  this short You bet Bye-bye
