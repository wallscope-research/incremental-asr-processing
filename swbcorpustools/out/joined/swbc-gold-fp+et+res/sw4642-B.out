Uh-huh Yeah So do you have a car Do you have a car Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah We used to have a Honda Accord and they're good They're really good cars Every time I get taken to an auto repair place you know every time I go I get taken Bad you know Woman goes in and they go all right we got a sucker Let's ge- see how much money we can get out of her you know That's what happens every time so I have a Pontiac Six Thousand Yeah But our Honda just got old and just wore out It was let's see eleven years old and it just just out of it so No huh-uh My hu- ex-husband's this is just happened a couple of weeks ago He's my ex-husband but just a few months ago when he was my husband his father gave us this car and everything is wrong with it I mean the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks you know eighty-seven And he just doesn't take care of things and but I was awarded the car so There is a man in my church that is a mechanic and I can trust him So he is trying to get you know things fixed on it But it's just you know leak leak leak everywhere But you know I hate to go into a a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not you know and charge me twice as much The last time I took it into a repair shop the man told me I needed a master cylinder So I said okay And he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars and then about a month later a man was looking at my car and he asked me you know not a man not a repair man but just a friend and I was telling him that I just a new master cylinder put on and he looked at and he said that's not a new master cylinder and I didn't even know what one was And he showed it to me and it was old rusty just awful It was no more new than nothing more than likely That was it probably It was ve- I was so irritated And that's happened to me more than once or twice Jus- just just about every time I've went in somewhere And and you ju- can hardly find one you know The guy that's doing most of my my car now goes to my church and that's the only reason you know I go to him because I know him and I know he will tell me the truth Because he doesn't even charge me for for doing it so he's not going <> to you know take me I just pay for the parts and he does it so Yeah Yeah I am so I don't know I don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car they're usually the worst one of all We took our Honda to the Honda dealership and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car Yeah And so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars we you know they told us we just had to have one and we bought one We didn't no more need no new engine give me break you know So it was it was not good and
