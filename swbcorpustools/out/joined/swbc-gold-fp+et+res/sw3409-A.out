I think I'm down to one Well no I was pulling your leg I I well the way I'd like to try and use it is you you you make your purchases at at prime buying time and then you pay that off and don't use it until it's paid off That's that's my ideal way Emergencies come along and I and I use it like my car had a major problem and seven hundred dollars and things just come up and you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to Uh-huh  Yeah Yeah Well I I know I was up in there and a lot of credit cards and I was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble so we just disposed of them paid them off and got out of it I just Yeah Yeah yeah Well now we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there Our our only credit card is Sears so and I have that for automotive purposes Yeah Yeah it's it's just too easy basically just get yourself in trouble with those I see Yeah I wouldn't mind you know getting back into one if they would you know you start out at a low limit and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit and and if I can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred and I can never go over that or something like that then that's fine but they eventually get's up there to five thousand ten thousand whatever fifty thousand forget it I don't want that Yeah So I don't know just writing checks is just as easy I guess Yeah well really what what can you Other than you use them or you don't use them You like them or you don't like them So I guess they don't care if we end it early So hopefully you have a good Thanksgiving That's coming up and And then maybe we'll talk again Yeah Texas is the big one Okay then Well bye now
