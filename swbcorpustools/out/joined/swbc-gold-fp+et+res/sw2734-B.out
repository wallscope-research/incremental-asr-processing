yes yeah They just started it again too just late or within the past few years You know for quite some time just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty yes Well they find it is more deterrent Well if you You know compare the figures I think that's where they're they're coming from The there yes They are That was before the they adopted the death law again But I I myself am in favor of it particularly for well I think Texas has a good good law crimes murders related with drugs or killing a policemen Uh-huh Uh-huh Well why stop at children Why not go to adults too Uh-huh Uh-huh Yep Well I don't either but but there is something to be said about <> or j- just for the sake of argument I'm taking the a con I'm I'm against it you know yourself how many times have you heard where a citizen was wrongfully arrested and served time at a penitentiary just recently this black man served nine years was it for robbery Uh-huh That's it Uh-huh Well right now our laws are so liberal that even with the death penalty in effect I don't think that they're going to use it too frequently unfortunately I like you say yes let's have it put them all give them all a shot get rid of them Why should they be sit- sitting in prison getting their college degree Uh-huh Yes very true I I agree with you there slash error Uh-huh Well I myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that I it it's that's an awful lot to to expect of a person to to kill somebody is what it amounts to It true Very true But they they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason Yeah well slash error Uh-huh <> Yeah exactly Well anyhow I guess we both agree that that it is it should be in effect that's true Well now any just believe in just about any state in the union a death or yeah death verdict is an automatic appeal And yes I'm inclined to agree with you I think so there should be a limit as to the number of appeals well n- Not just for dealing in drugs It There are certain circumstances and I don't remember what they are yes Uh-huh yes yes I I believe it's any capital crime related to drugs I think that's the way it's worded I do believe that's in I wouldn't swear to it myself But I thought it I thought it was in effect Uh-huh Uh-huh it does I have four sons myself and the youngest is twenty-eight so they are all pretty well grown up and they all went through it you know going through high school and everything and knock wood that they have not well I won't say they didn't try it I wouldn't know but they I doubt very much that they're they're using it now In fact I'm sure they don't  Yes Uh-huh Yeah That's usually the way it is It it's just try it out with their peers And none of them even smoke They don't they never strangely enough their mother and I both smoked when they were growing up Now my my my wife my ex-wife she quit well when she was pregnant with the last one and she never started up again And I just quit about fourteen months and two weeks ago Yes it is I and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by  Well Well when I was still smoking I I felt that way If I was in a public restaurant seated at table with non smokers I would try to pick a s- a a my seat where the smoke would blow away from them Or I'd hold the cigarette under the table And but now I'm on the shoe's on the other foot I'm aware of other people smoking now  Yes Uh-huh uh-huh Well the there's a trick I use They used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment And every time I wanted one I have to go outside and just take one One at a time And that that 's gets to be a deterrent
