Well th- the question was talking about the juries and one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having that especially for repeat offenders that maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again so that a judge I think would be the most appropriate person to to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day slash error slash error Right slash error should be 'aa' Right <> Uh-huh Yeah See I agree with you one thing I heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have a a mock court I mean it's supposed to be all legal and everything you go and you present your case the other side presents their case and you're done with it It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V and but it's not that we have such it didn't backlog or all of the the cases that are all ready pending so I that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way Yes Yes Now Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure slash error yes slash error should be aa and and I wasn't I didn't mean that I I didn't mean that no Because I mean gee whiz if I was didn't have that right you know not to have a jury that yes I would feel you're right that my civil rights had been violated But I meant for some when both parties agreed that yes we're going to have a judge here We're not going to have a jury you know let's get it over with Sort of like car accidents you know Yeah slash error slash error Right slash error should be 'aa' right Uh-huh Right Giving a different sentence Uh-huh The take Right Well I I i- we're at liberty to to talk and and meander as long as it's all on the same theme Uh-huh slash error slash error slash error slash error Right slash error should be 'aa' Right slash error Uh-huh slash error should be 'b' Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Yeah bu- well you can tell I haven't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that N- well I was called once when I was nineteen and but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me and I was doing school and things like they they let me out An- I've never had to it since and that was almost twenty years ago slash error Uh-huh slash error Uh-huh  How interesting Uh-huh Uh-huh
