Okay so what kind of movies have you seen lately I guess Obviously you have kids I haven't seen that one yet the last movie I saw was SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY see I'm not a big Julie Roberts fan But I was a lot I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would be It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be Yeah it was a pretty good movie I I'm ready to go It just it's you know hasn't worked out that way yet You know it's it looks good you know if you like thrillers anyway In fact people I've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards So Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Well what other movies have you seen then lately Other than the I assume you were talking about the new NINJA TURTLES Is that any good I mean I'm sure I'm going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives and she's got two boys that I took to see the first one So I'm sure I'm going to see the next one here real soon well then it won't be too bad You know it wasn't impressive necessarily but it was better than it could have been Yeah Yeah I think that's important if you're going you know if you're going kids are going to parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least semi- you know semi for them too Yeah Uh-huh I's about to say you're not going to take her to that one I'm sure Do you take her or do you go to a lot of comedy movies or to What was the last comedy you saw The last in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw I said that wrong the last movie I saw was THE HARD WAY with Michael J Fox Well that really wasn't too bad There were you know he's supposed you know he's this actor right and he's playing a cop Or he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff I think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop I mean there there were times when he was like he'd be running with a gun or whatever He didn't look like a cop when he did it And I was so impressed with that because you know usually yeah because I mean everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to you know to imitate them or whatever And I thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far Now by the end he was looking more like a cop But at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part you know he was trying to trying to get it but he wasn't there yet And you could tell it and I guess that I thought was a real good acting and writing job both you know because I think or directing job I think they did a real good job of that And James Woods I think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop I mean you know he just Yeah and there were there were some definite should I say tense moments with him in there Yes I I I had seen it before Christmas but I took a date to it about a month ago So I I I've seen it the second time not too long ago So I really enjoyed it Of course the bad thing about it was the second time I saw it I didn't really enjoy it as much and I was kind of surprised at that I thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over But before maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time I had laughed so hard I was hoarse I really was I was hoarse getting out of there And maybe I just laughed so hard the first time that I didn't have it I mean it just wasn't as funny the second time because I had just gone overboard the first time I don't know but Yeah I mean it was it was a great movie though I loved the movie I love those movies yeah Well you have to see them more than that I I I still catch things in AIRPLANE that I didn't catch I mean it's amazing I love those movies I really do Yeah yeah Uh-huh isn't it though You know but that's at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper That's exactly what I was going to say I keep not doing it until after I'm there and then all of a sudden I'm saying I wish I'd bought these things Easily Yeah yeah And then if you want popcorn and stuff it's just I mean it's incredible No No nowhere near that expensive And it it's just the idea that these these actors you know live in such lavish style I mean it's as simple as that Yeah and as long as we keep paying the money for it they are going to keep paying them Yes yeah that was that was an excellent movie No don't Don't That needs the big screen It really and truly does because to get the feeling of like when the buffalos are when they're chasing the buffalos and everything you've got to be where you feel it You really truly do I would I mean I guess my first instinct was to wait for the video too But I'm glad I didn't I really and truly am I mean that mov- that was one movie I came out impressed I really and truly did I mean I have absolutely no problems with them winning seven Oscars None at all Normally I'm one of these people that I don't like one one movie taking all the honors I wanted him to win best actor on top of it he was Like I said I wouldn't given the supporting actresses either one But even though they were okay the girl in it they somebody made an interesting observation now that I think back on it I'd say yeah I can't believe that either She was the only indian to have her hair done at all times You know what I mean you know It was just too perfect at all times That was a mistake that they made They shouldn't have done it Now the best the supporting actor he was good but from what I heard the guy who got it was better so I you know I can see that But well there are there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side But it's it's Okay no problems It it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide the hides So there's Yeah but well And and of course and well yeah that and plus I mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt So I mean they are killing buffalos in it But they don't stress that very much they really don't And I think it's an excellent movie for if if she enjoys movies I think it'll work pretty good It's it's it's a long movie yeah I may have to see the video I hadn't even thought of that Uh-huh Yeah Well yeah I kind of like it when they do that because the video like I said there are certain things you can't do with a video and the idea that they may put a little extra in it I think is a good idea Because I mean when you rent a video videos of course are not cheap either and so the idea of getting a little extra with it I think is a good idea Because they they make bundles of money off those things I do too Yeah but not enough Yeah I'm getting to the point where you know I watch well I watch NICK AT NIGHT
