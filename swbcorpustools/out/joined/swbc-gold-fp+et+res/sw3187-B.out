Well I don't feel very good about it but I think that at some times it can be the right thing to do We sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore He actually died a few months after that and so as at least in retrospect it was the right thing to do because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days well the see well we he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list right we wound up just choosing a another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into Or but naturally no it was even Mennonite related I'm sorry it was actually not a particularly great nursing home Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in what do you think Uh-huh Yeah Yeah yeah that's important I would say Okay Yeah Right so that slash error two utts Right and that becomes difficult then Uh-huh Yep we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could but he was living alone had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain and this eventually things just went too far and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home Right well that's yeah that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to help decide what's the right thing And Uh-huh Yep
