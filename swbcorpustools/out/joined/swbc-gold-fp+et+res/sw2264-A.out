Well since you live close I don't know if you know about what Louisville is doing with recycling or are you familiar with any of that Huh-uh Yeah You know I read you know when they first started doing that in the paper and I read about that I was just praying that that would be in our area because we've been recycling for quite some time And you know we separate everything out and then have to haul it up to a Metco you know which is a real pain So if they would come up curbside recycling Well now have they moved them behind Wal-Mart God Oh That's really nice to know because we were doing the same thing Because to take it to a Metco you have to take it when they're open you know which is always a real pain And so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart parking lot we thought this is great And we started taking them up there And then all the sudden it disappeared you know I didn't know And we're going no there goes our recycling place That's really nice to find out that it's behind there Well we pretty much do plastic milk cartons and newspapers I couldn't even think of what you call them Plastic milk cartons newspapers and cans and glass I guess is the four is really the four things that we do Yeah Yeah And really that's about that's really about it Is there anything any place else that really takes anything other than that that you know of really I know I know I know We're kind of the same way You know at first you know you at first it was a real it was a real hassle and I'm wondering are we really going to do this but you kind of get I guess into a little routine you know where it becomes is automatic now to throw different things in different places you know So I just go you know we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and I've just got three trash cans sitting in there you know we just kind of dump things in each one if you know if we get them so they do too And they're impossible to crush I mean you can't get the down to any size you know If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag you know pretty easily so You know really Yeah Yeah that will be good Sure Let somebody get something out of it Yeah Ha-ha Well I was kind of hoping with you know do you work for T I No Yeah There was a T I has got this organization called T A D which is T I'ers Against Drugs And you know we're recycling aluminum cans up here and just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know and that's they use the money from that to fund this T I'ers Against Drugs Program It's you know T I doesn't give them any money all everything is made from that And they had talked about having a thing like one Saturday a month you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home you know And I'm kind of like yeah I shall they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it you know That was going to use it for good so Sounds like you have a little one just like I do Yeah Mine was two in December Well it was good to talk to you do they really Curbside pick up I really hope they do that in Louisville It would make it a lot easier on all of us Talk to you later Bye-bye
