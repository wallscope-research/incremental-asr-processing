Well I think they're kind of ambivalent really I just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know We we don't know half the time we don't know who to support That and you know maybe it's maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with with countries like that that depend on us so much without you know just telling them running their country for them but It's got to be tough but I mean you sure you still have to you know let them know how you feel Yeah it worries me that the economy of so many countries in in South America and Central America depend on something that damages people like the you know like cocaine from Columbia and you know of course I I'm sure we have some enemies down there who wouldn't care what happened to us but but that is that's a tough deal and it I don't think that maybe I maybe it's you know I'm reflecting how I feel about it but I have a feeling that we that we really don't understand basically the the the competing factions in lot of those countries and I mean they've been hammering for the last you know ten centuries and it's still going on and we we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how some times Yeah Yeah yeah Yeah well I'm blank on it I can see his face forget his name Yeah kind of nationalized it for himself Yeah Dictator Yeah And it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing it just you know unstable Well I think it's long overdue I just you know there's so much difference in in the economies of the two countries I'm not you know I have a problem with whether it's going to work or not you know there's it seems like there's and I this may be unfair to Mexico but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in in foreign policy a lot of the times Yeah Yeah yeah I think their their version of the good old boy network going that you know has a lot
