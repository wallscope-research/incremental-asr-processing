No I would agree with you We haven't had too much but historically we've always almost been like a big brother to in and to the Latin American area and almost used them I I I feel I think something will have to be done down there very soon about about Mexico and and some of the other areas but but with the Persian Gulf as you said it's just been very quiet I I keep pretty close tabs on the paper and you don't hardly see a unless it's there and we're just not seeing it Uh-huh Well that's Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh I I agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world and so there's a lot of money to be made there and it's be very difficult to to cut it back to a a level where it should be And and it will come back to haunt us it seems to come in cycles Uh-huh Right Right and the probably the bigge- biggest problem down there is that's where the that's the drug entry points and their economy is of s- several of the countries especially Columbia is so built on the on t- on the drugs that our our little war on drugs has really been laughable It's just a you know such a small amount and it doe- it just it cuts off just a trickle and if if we can't get a handle on that through some through some method I don't know where whe- that will be another big problem Right right And as long as we're the largest consumer then this is the market If we can cut back the usage then maybe it will have to go someplace else Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah Right yeah should this be two slash units we're just so much wealthier and and there has to be resentment built up and that's where leaders can use use that whenever the opportune moment arises Yeah That's right Our own hemisphere but we've that's been that's been the way it's always been So Very much so except when we need them You know when they found oil in Mexico then we got very friendly with them again Yeah  Okay Sure did Always yes ma'am You too dear Bye
