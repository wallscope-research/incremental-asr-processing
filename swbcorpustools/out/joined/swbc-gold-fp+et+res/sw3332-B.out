Sure No Of course I use credit cards I have a couple of credit cards and use them we try not to We're on a pretty strict and tight budget We use the credit cards however when we're at a situation where we don't have either the cash or the checkbook handy Or we use credit cards also if we want to get an extended warranty on an item that we're purchasing So So yes and basically we use it mainly when we're traveling or out of state or or somewhere where you know they don't take local they don't take out of state checks and so when we're traveling some Do you use credit cards often Uh-huh yeah well that's that's a good thing because lot of people don't pay at the end of the month and they just pay the minimum required balance Yes and you get in over your head It'll some people I know also try to use it as float where they buy something now and say well I'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale and then I can go ahead and pay for it when I get my check at the end of the month when I'm being paid That's true Uh-huh Right How a- how are the laws in Pennsylvania as as regard well not the laws but the rates credit card rates in Pennsylvania For example down here when you go up to a gas station you get an extra charge for credit cards than you would by paying for cash Are they the same there That's pretty steep Yes Uh-huh uh-huh Yes because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase and and so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill are you saying that that way you're not left stranded and high and dry Very good You're you're one of the good I guess good faithful shoppers that don't get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money Uh-huh Well yeah well I see that as an advantage to a credit card also that you can can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to to help yourself So I think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh do you have multiple credit cards And do you find that advantageous or Uh-huh Right We're we're actually in the same boat We like to use three basic credit cards That way we're not confused and we don't have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes the end of the month And do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail Once a week twice a week or three times a week Yeah Right so the annual fee Right right Yes so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty-three percent based upon what the state will allow
