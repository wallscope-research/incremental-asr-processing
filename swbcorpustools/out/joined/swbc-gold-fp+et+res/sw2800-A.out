I don't guess we got our first credit card back in the seventies early seventies when I first got married was a Visa card issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City because my sister worked at the the Visa some Bank Americard center there one utt with a3 utt2  So we were still in college and had she not worked there I'm not sure that I would have qualified They've come in handy over the years and they have become or also a a real bother sometimes Especially you know if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation it's just easier to put everything on a card And I find if you're not careful you wind up a month or so staring those bills in the face and you go I don't remember doing all that stuff and it adds up So sometimes especially traveling with T I you know everything goes on American Express and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping But as far as personal life goes I guess I really try to use them as little as possible I kind of like having them for gasoline purchases Yeah But other than that I I guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome of just putting everything on there day after day after day and then then you really get socked to it if you don't watch it How how do you look at counting credit cards Well that's Right Well that's kind of the way we were doing it's I guess for that very reason that that if you're not real conscious of what you're doing it's just too much by the time you get well if you got a bunch of cards you get a bunch of bills every month and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid Yeah And I give them maybe not maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid because they're know if you don't then they're adding on what eighteen nineteen twenty percent Sometimes it's twenty-two percent interest Yeah I guess that's one of the motivations behind the the the American Express card with T I there's no with the American Express card from T I there's no late fee there's no interest rate you ei- you either pay the thing off or they come get it And it's turned into personnel and they come get you So they've got quite a bit more motivation I think to get paid then some of the others do But that's the one that your call center manager sees every month so you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that even though you can use it however you want to yeah You can use it like any other card and but it you know you kind of you know that somebody every month and who knows how many people are looking at those bills that come in and those statements you're not the only one So yo- you want to make sure that is that okay is that o- okay that those people see what it is that you are buying and most of the time it is But most of the others I've sent back I mean all you get is card offers two utts I've got three card offers now from gas companies and Visa Gold and some other bank Citibank I think is always sending the Visa stuff out And I usually just throw them away because I I don't want another one I don't want to have to mess with it You know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards and one of these days it's going to all be full that's not bad Yeah No if they don't say no annual membership on them I'll throw them away slash error years ago well th- I had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for sd probably fifteen years and then they started charging annual membership fees and I said adios I'm you know I'm not paying you It's just another way to make money as far as I can tell I mean they've been Well sure And they I guess they figure they've got enough people out there with cards they're going to get cards at the twenty bucks a pop There's going to be that much more so then a couple years ago I found a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership So I went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account in his name and got my Visa card so as long as they have no annual membership fee I it would be okay but I can't see paying someone to use their card Be charged their eighteen percent interest so slash error Yeah I think you're right The best philosophy is have them if you need them but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere <> Yeah Yeah it sure does Maybe they're counting on that I don't know Well I guess that's it Thanks for talking Bye
