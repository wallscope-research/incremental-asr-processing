Well let's see well we assume I was an adult twenty years ago Yeah definitely able to go to war twenty years ago but not vote Not vote That was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years yeah twenty years ago is nineteen seventy nineteen seventy I had been married two years we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty-eight And around here on the east coast we were heavy into affirmative action And that was a a great shock for a lot of people And uh a great disappointment for some people like myself I was gainfully employed by Safeway Stores Incorporated And trying desperately to get ahead with the company the problem was that my hair was too long and you weren't allowed to have a mustache or a beard and you know jeans just flat out weren't allowed unless you worked on night stock and if you wanted to get ahead with the company well if you were a black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months if you were white male you're talking six years And that's basically where I ended up I I just flat out couldn't get hold you know get ahead with the company because they were dead in affirmative action on other fronts  I think so I I I I stopped working for them in seventy-eight seventy-nine And it's I think they're they're like all companies well represented And you know everything seems to be fine I I've kind of lost touch with the company/ we had a falling out but as far as as their management goes I'm not sure they're any any better off than they were were before management wise But other changes just people seem to be more outspoken now individually rather than collectively back in the seventies we had a lot of protests against the war and bring our troops home and things were more organized And I've noticed that now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together  Yeah I'm not sure if that was because you know eighties was like the the me decade And everybody was into me and then we are getting back into us But it it it's I've seen a great deal of change as far as corporate responsibility and things and people's response to that you know at first not trusting and now expecting more And what ab- what about the last ten years that you've been aware Uh-huh Yes Yes But even I think along the line of the goals of civil rights there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone I mean you know You know don't like the way you look don't like the way you dress don't like your hair don't like you know it's just something that always sets people off You know you either like someone or you don't like someone or you're just completely indifferent And the problem is that ideally you they you know the world would like you to be completely indifferent So but I I I understand what you say about the environmental movement it's it's been a long time coming/ and being a a very old hippie I mean you know if you had long hair in high school in the sixties you got labeled a hippie and you keep that image your whole life No matter what you do And I I just I've seen a lot of changes I mean from the original earth day and I'm heavily involved in you know my own personal recycling We recycle paper and cans here at work and you know I do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and you know all that stuff at home and I'm starting to see more and more recycling centers cropping up all over the place here on the east coast Yeah like Yeah And then they turned around and called them junkyards and started making profits off them after the war And now we got to the point where the junkyards you've got to pay them to take something there so things have really changed a lot I think the the other part about America's decline I think has to do with yeah the perceived decline has to do with the attitudes and the educational system I have children in in s- I have three children in school right now and I'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them I had when I was down in Dallas for two years I had my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong and words spelled wrong not marked as such And this person's teaching my children You know I had a real problem with that Yeah Yeah I'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in Maryland but they're trying to get a a a merit system here in Maryland rather than a tenure system for all the you know elementary middle school and high schools So that the teach
