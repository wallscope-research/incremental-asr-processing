Hi this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis Minnesota How you doing Good I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it I'm ready whenever you are So what are your what are your thoughts on the subject there Yeah Yeah I think that's probably a good thing Yeah I mean it's to easy to get a quorum and simple majority won't do Yeah that's yeah quorums are to easy to get And there's always that that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason you know So it's it's definitely but I don't know I could I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing Yeah Tha- I I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that Or arguing against that pretty vehemently But Yeah About the only good thing I would say about that is it w- that it would hurry the process up a bit but I mean even now we've got I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that and that's what the trial by jury I mean jeez if if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances whose to say Yeah no doubt Are you involved in the legal system at all Okay Yeah yeah I've got some friends that are lawyers so One of them just got his law degree But to tell you the truth I'm not real familiar with the system of juris- jurisprudence the way it is right now I really haven't studied it in depth Yeah I'm sure of it Because a lot of those things it's all it's in it's largely a matter of viewpoint And who can argue their case better it's kind of weird I don't know you I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something And how weird those cases get It's just Yeah Uh-huh And it's like boy the stuff that they can twist around is it's pretty amazing Yeah it's not And then you get people who who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because Like this this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious and he really gets into suing people And so he'll he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue his case you know it's like + slash error It is  + It's  + it's  wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else aasv But Yeah And and most of the time they're looking to place blame and stuff See you're from California is that right okay I was just thinking I wonder I wonder how how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say where I am in Minneapolis From what I understand it's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana And Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the what is it it's based on common law and the rest of the country is not or something like that Pretty strange But fortunately I never have had to go in even even for jury duty But that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in for as a witness He may subpoena me So we'll see what happens But Yeah It's there are too many big problems you know There's there's such a backlog of court cases right now You know to try to get them all in in a good time and we already have too many lawyers as it is Yeah Yeah that's true And in fact they're even letting some go I I I'm originally from Florida and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them you know That's not a that's not a good solution either I'm not real sure what the
