Uh-huh yeah well sometimes I'm home and sometimes I'm not but if I am it's always fun to talk I am as a matter of fact I'm at North Carolina State Yeah I think I was the one who did that actually Yeah I had a I teach a course in Voice I O Systems So I know you know I know about this project so I got my students to sign up and apparently a number of them have been participating Uh-huh Yeah let's see the subject is Latin America I don't know whether I have any real profound thoughts about that I actually wa- was planning a trip to Latin America and I got warned off by some people They say Peru can't be traveled to and the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth Yeah Yeah I I don't understand it either although I I think a lot of South Americans regard the United States as as bullying And that's certainly from a historical point of view would be true I mean certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking in in his wildest dreams from his neighbors Yeah well I think they're going to have that's a tough row for them to to hoe because I think most of the world is going to regard citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans And they can stand on their heads if they want too but I don't think that they're going they're going to change that and and and really I mean North Americans I think are when you say that even I thi- I mean I tend to think of Americans and Canadians I just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans although I guess strictly speaking they are I see I don't know Yeah well it's it's so interesting I ju- I just don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics Yeah Yeah Well I grew up in Los Angeles And in fact I drove a cab when I was a graduate student so I I knew the Hispanic part of L A pretty well And certainly you know knew that problem knew you know knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that And it was it was pretty wild Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah I'm sorry Well I am actually Yeah Yeah I'm the I'm the teacher I give as it were Yeah I'm in Computer Science and very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition but of course this project is really one to collect a data base of of of casual speech in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like Yeah well they record these and then somebody transcribes them so that they they have they have a speech signal and what and what is said And they have a they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening and that's a big problem in speech recognition Yeah Yeah Right
