Of course We are talking about the elderly and whether or not we wo- we like nursing homes and as a matter of fact I can tell you something about that No actually my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years and her mother No she did And then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home for years And then went on back to school and became the director of nurses at a nursing home And my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses So I do know something about that Absolutely Actually the motivation for Grandmother entering the business was that her mother was very old and couldn't seem to find companions She was lonely And she needed company for her mother and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies And then it it grew into a very prosperous business from that point then they Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that is not really true either I think that is a stigma and an I and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences You see those who had bad experiences talk about them And those who do not may write a letter to the nursing home and say you did good but they do not talk a whole lot about that Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Well now That is right Well that is because they wait until the children make those choices they choose to not make those choices themselves However my daughter-in-law also is a nurse in a nursing home And she works for one here in Dallas which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home And these these I love watching these elderly people come they will come and tell her "Well I am going for my tennis lessons And would yo- would you you know call down and have the van come around and take us for our tennis lessons" And they are very active and very enthusiastic and they have some excellent programs right there on site Their dining room looks like you know Luby's Cafeteria Or or one of the lovely cafeterias And they have you know pink linen napkins for their dinners And a well equipped library I am certainly very much for a nursing home and I think when the the parent gets old enough to the extent where they just do not want to be bothered with keeping house and with taking care of themselves anymore That is a wonderful alternative It is expensive It is costly Uh-huh Well now my daddy's mother lived in a a retirement village and she and her sister had side by side duplexes one bedroom duplex She still had her individuality but they were there close and they did have you know the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems and there were lights that you could flip on and so forth And they have security No I am very much in favor I have heard horror stories I know that the elderly can easily be abused but I would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than are they are in homes of their own children Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Absolutely Well now my grandmother of course all of my folks lived to be very old and my grandmother developed Hodgkin's Disease when she was in her late eighties late seventies I mean She went to the doctor she had surgery she got the treatments and during the period of time that she was undergoing those treatments she was in a nursing home She got better she got well she got out and went dancing again Uh-huh That is right Uh-huh uh-huh I think it is a wonderful interim place it is a place that you do not have to struggle with hospital problems and yet it is not you know you have Uh-huh uh-huh It certainly is It certainly does but you see we have had excellent experience with that And I I did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill but I would not object to going to one I might I might like to be coherent enough to make my own choice I would not particularly think I would want my kids to say "well I think this is what I need for Mom" and then dump me there But I would like That is right Uh-huh uh-huh And I think you would shop for a nursing home just like you would shop for a church or a doctor or anything else Uh-huh sure Uh-huh When you get to the point where you are in trouble and you have got to have that help you are in no position to make those choices That is right Uh-huh Absolutely I think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they are going to be needing those facilities one day and to actually get involved and participate on a community level with community service Go out to the nursing home help guide some craft programs perhaps work on some music programs whatever their talents are And work with those senior citizens Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh That is right Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah That is right Well one of the things I think that is most desirable for the elderly and that is routine Routine and constancy the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over I do not think they pay the nursing home staff sufficiently to to get the dedication that they have in some other profession and that is sad because I think the health profession is one of the most critical And That is right Care for the elderly and care for the children I cannot imagine a more costly and a more a more better area to invest your money You are preserving your heritage and your future there And as a matter of fact I do not see why they do not have children's programs in nursing homes Uh-huh Uh-huh
