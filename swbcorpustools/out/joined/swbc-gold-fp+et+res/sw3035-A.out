Uh our children are both uh basically adults They we've we've got two Uh one is twenty-one and one is twenty-five And they they still live at home Well that's that's a little unusual for uh for children of that age to have both of them that age at home But uh I guess the activities that uh we have with them are uh pretty few and far between Actually the they're both going on their own most of the time So uh most of our activities are you know just discussion type things about what's going on in the family and what they're doing and that kind of thing Sure it does Uh-huh Oh yeah I Yeah Yeah is the one year old a boy A girl Yea- ours uh the older one is a girl so And the and the younger one is a boy so Uh I guess uh what I see is so far as uh the trends uh uh for children uh I don't know what kind of a area Virginia Beach is but of course uh Richardson is in the Dallas area And I think uh the big city uh activities for for children now are they're good but there's so much uh potential danger you know that you really have to watch your children so closely now that you can't let them grow up the way the way I grew up you know I I'm from a smaller town in east Texas And I could you know go and do whatever pretty much whatever I wanted to do uh my whole life Uh you know I never never had to worry about the bad guys being out there And uh you know I find it's it's quite a bit different now that uh you know you have to watch your children so closely and uh keep up with them I I feel like uh that it's it's really a sad commentary on uh you know a life in general that uh you know that children can't cannot be allowed to grow up uh you know without really close supervision Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah Yeah Um I guess looking at uh back at at what our children did compared to what uh you know what I had to go through in school The uh there i- there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum It's a lot more complicated A lot more available of course But uh this so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult I would think I I would probably have a hard time getting through school myself Uh you know just or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when I went to school Uh-huh Right Yeah Huh yeah I think uh {Very faint} Oh Right Yeah Yeah Yeah That uh uh watching a little little boys play soccer is is more fun I can't imagine th- them having as much fun as the parents had watching them Right yeah The the disorganized play really what it was but but uh yeah when ours was a he I guess he was probably five or six you know when he first started playing soccer And uh and that was that was more fun to watch those boys trying to trying to kick the ball up and down the field But uh and it's I guess that was you know as important uh as much important to the parents as it was to the children that uh you know to get out and watch the kids play so I guess one of the things that I think about is a talking about education uh I kind of feel like uh that uh the the school systems in this particularly in this area the systems are not under enough control The the students have a little too much uh too much leeway Excuse me Um an- an- and the and that's kind of contradictory to what I said but you know you the hell you have to be under control so much when they're out but when they're in school they they don't have quite quite as much control over them as uh as what I would liked to have seen Uh uh I kind of feel like there's there's too much allowed to go on in at at school And uh you know it tends to uh to encourage students to not be as you know to not concentrate as much on the education You know they're they're there for a good time And you know to to see how little they can get by with Right But uh {Very faint} Yeah But uh I I don't I don't know I think uh you know some of the thing has to do with uh with the civil rights program Not that the civil rights program is bad but that there's it carried over into you know individual rights and it you know trickled ou-
