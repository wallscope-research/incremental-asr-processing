Well basically did you want to go first then Okay right Uh-huh Sure uh-huh Yeah I think as far as like our home it's in a small residential area We're out of the cities quite a ways so it's kind of more of a country setting and it's just a typical three bedroom type of home It's it's nothing you know elaborate where it has this or this or you know It's it's just a typical home with three bedrooms two story type home and I think as far as if it's for put it into standards of what other homes are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes and yet there's where we can view the river from that distance there's still homes within our area that are you know pretty typical of what our home is so it's pretty much that type of home so Uh-huh really Sure Uh-huh Yeah yeah yeah Yeah Uh-huh So it's the rambler style Uh-huh Yeah yeah It's kind of like what ours is one of our bedrooms is really small and we've made that into a den because we only have one child so that was our best way of going with the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller It seems like they get incredibly small but anyway but okay So that sounds great and I don't know if we need to talk any more or whatever The T I yes about three times before I'm fairly new to it but it seems to be going okay No huh-uh No I'm out of state I'm in Wisconsin so Yeah yeah So it's other than that sure yeah Is this your first time Uh-huh I'm always the one that initiates the calls because I kind of like it because it's like I can get it done with I don't have to wait until somebody calls me even though I have a feeling what's going to happen is I'll probably get tons of calls you know so sooner or later Uh- Uh-huh Yeah yeah Yeah sure Yeah Okay well you take it easy Gail Bye now
