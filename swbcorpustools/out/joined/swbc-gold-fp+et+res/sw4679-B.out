Okay Well I think the court systems could stand some improvement trial by jury is good but a lot of time i- a lot of cases is circumstantial evidence that that convicts a person which I don't think is all the time good Because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent I mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me I don't know I think so Uh-huh Right Uh-huh You think you prefer the jury You think your chances are better Well that's true Uh-huh Well s- sometimes the sentencing is still is not fair I mean even if well the jury I guess they do decide that but but I'm like you in a case like that most of the time its I don't know maybe I'm too too conservative when it comes to that Th- the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases you know Right Yeah Uh-huh <> Right really Yeah That's that's not a bad system But I I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit But the thing is too maybe they need more of a I don't know more of a expert types to to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an- and call them in exactly Right exactly Yeah Uh-huh Put- putting on a act or whatever slash error should be ^2 Uh-huh Exactly exactly
