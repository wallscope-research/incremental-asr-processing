Okay I'm twenty-nine Right And I have I mean I've seen some change like I know when I was young most mothers pretty much were housewives and stayed at home with the kids and to to me it seems like its almost the opposite now where the the woman is working and and they you know take the children to child care or maybe they work part-time or something So that seems to be a pretty big change Uh-huh Yeah right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh that's true That's true Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Well I know the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because I think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you you know you protected the children and you want to be with the children yet there's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think but if we both work we can get a really big house and we can have two really nice cars we can take a vacation we can do this and it's kind of almost expected of you anyway People kind of look down on a on a you know the role of a woman as a housewife it's kind of like well you know she didn't go to college and she's just a housewife Right Right Even though there's probably women with M B A's maybe even Ph D's that are staying at home with the children  Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Right There's some T V show on now and I I think I've seen it once I don't get to watch much T V but there's a T V show where the man is the one raising the kids and the wife is and I maybe they based it on that MISTER MOM movie but but there is a T V show out there I guess they're trying to gain more public acceptance of things like that Because I know there are cases of where that happens and Uh-huh Right It's probably getting more and more accepted today in fact it seems like it's kind of like anything goes now you're not too surprised on much of anything When you know the husband's the one at home raising the children the mother works that's not real surprising And Right Yeah In fact I'm pretty sure TI has something like that because one of the area supervisors in my area as a matter of fact took off for a couple of weeks when his wife had their baby Now it might have been just to take care of her and the baby instead of having a you know a a nurse or someone come in or or something like that or whatever mid-wife or whatever they call it that they have for the first couple of weeks But I don't know if he took that out of his vacation or if they really do have a paternity he put paternity leave up there but it might have just been him describing the fact that he was taking vacation days to go be a father for a little while I don't know But I'm not real sure how that goes Right Uh-huh Right Well people they in general are just getting married a lot later I'm still single so I'm sure I'll be one of those parents that's you know one of those women in her thirties when when I get around to to ever getting married and having kids That's I think I think that's getting a little more common too Uh-huh Right Yeah I agree I agree I think it also gives a woman a chance if she does have a job and a career it gives the man and the wife both the chance to both be working and maybe save up some money and then it gives her a little more option if she wants to stay home with the children while they're young and be a mother for awhile and then once they've gotten to school age maybe she could go back to work So she's kind of got that option if if they wait till later they've saved up some money that it's not as difficult for her to stay at home with the kids and live off one income or something Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh I seem to see more women in in leadership type roles and management positions in politics Yeah Like the Mayor of Dallas is a woman And I'm sure that twenty years ago that never would have happened but yeah she's I think she's in her second term now So she's she's yeah this is her second term I think she's going to going to not going to run again after this But but we do and we have several council women that are women but you just start hearing more and more In fact the the Governor of Texas is a woman too We can't forget that one So Ann Richards Yeah She was inaugurated in January so so you're starting to see more of that and I know when I was younger it was all the Presidents and still all the Presidents are men but I'm sure that one of these days well look at Ferraro ran for Vice-President and I guess one of these days we'll we'll eventually have Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Right I agree Well I think we've we've gotten our five minutes or It was nice talking to you too You too Bye bye
