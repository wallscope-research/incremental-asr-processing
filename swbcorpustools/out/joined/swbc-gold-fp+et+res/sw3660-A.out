I think it's a real good concept drug testing procedures would have to be refined From what I've seen on the news there's a a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy poor procedure in drug testing Yeah there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their in their test but they didn't know for sure what it was but it was a drug so they got turned down and turns out it was a prescription Or people getting somebody else's blood test Same sort of problem that happens sometimes is these some of these like AIDS tests and such Yeah yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah <> Yeah I not very long ago worked for Wal-Mart and about a year and a half ago they instituted a a drug testing program well drug and alcohol testing program It's it's not a random through the s- it as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a a blood test but I think the big problem though is is they send these off to large labs and then they have thousands and thousands of samples that going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up things like that It's Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Sam's is part of Wal-Mart Yeah yeah Company's that was a great place to work Uh-huh Yeah they got to had two or three years in with them you can start buying stock and you have a have a little taken out of your check each each payday to put against + {F uh stock portfolio not portfolio just you know against Wal-Mart stock But you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while you're supposed to get five minutes do you have any idea let's see you were you were tested for drugs as you got into T as as you got into T I Yeah now were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through or Okay <> Yeah Yeah Yeah They they it was after I was already working there and they weren't testing any of those who were already working So
