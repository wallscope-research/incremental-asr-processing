Okay I I have five children all together my oldest two are already out and about in the world and I have a set of twins that are fourteen and my youngest is twelve yeah If you like doing everything twice at any rate my first two children I didn't spend a whole lot of time with them and you know was a a problem with having five children needing to work a a full-time job that was more than a full-time job I worked about fifty-one hours a week because I worked every worked eleven hours every Sunday And so I didn't get to spend as much time with them as I as I should have as I really wanted to Yeah The yeah the f- well it was with all of them but it was more an impact I think on the oldest two Because about the time I got out of working that long hours was when the when the twins were about three years old And they never you know I don't think they noticed I wasn't around that much You know with all the children around the house it's kind of hard to notice that Dad isn't around very much so what I've tried to do now that I've fi- went back to school and got my degree when I was thirty years old And so then I came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as I did fifty-one hours a week So I've tried to spend more time with the children since then what I'm currently doing is taking a lot of time I'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings we just started a thing where every other week we go to movies There's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights And so every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the movies And it's working out pretty well we're spending more time together I feel like I'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than I ever was to the two that were living there before in fact I found that I'm a lot closer with I have one son who's gone and I don't even know where he's at he's taken off for parts unknown but yeah A- and my daughter is has moved out of the house Her and I get along a lot better now that she's moved out of the house And so it's it's it's it's been difficult to try to find the time and I think it's important that we do because I notice that when I had spent two years down in Dallas down there they all have a a me kind of attitude And I noticed parents not spending time with their children and and going out and doing things And you know I knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine and you know it just you know I saw the family falling apart down there Yeah And so I think it's kind of important that I that I you know nurture the relationship I have with my children now And I'm doing my best to keep that up Yeah What's your been your experience she didn't up until the last six months  She just recently started working she worked a job until we moved to our new house and she quit that job because it was too inconvenient And she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week Huh Yeah Uh-huh Certainly do Uh-huh Yeah That sounds great I've I've noticed another thing when I was younger my father was always working And Yeah And you know he he worked a full-time job and a part-time job and I never saw him So I didn't have much of a role model to go by You know to learn how to be a a father and a parent and that kind of thing because I I can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or catch with my dad or doing anything with my dad Yeah And it if you don't have I don't I it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow then it's kind of tough You know everybody's not FATHER KNOWS BEST Yeah but Yeah Yeah Yeah I mean the the the capability to create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the the mental capacity to raise them And Yes Yes It's it's not easy I've you know I've helped out extremely well I can't say that but I've helped out as best I could at home And y- as you know with five children it takes a lot of work Even if even if someone's home all the time there's still a lot of things that have to be done well now I work for Texas Instruments So so I'm in computers Yeah And so I've prior to that I I worked in a food store And you know wor- slash error right slash error Yeah It it was it was a a smart move to make I was more intelligent than the position I was holding And it was Yes I I felt that it certainly was I mean I was smarter than most of the people that I was working for And you know every time something new came up I was explaining it to them And I had No Yeah I Yeah I started back to school In fact I was going to school while I was working fifty-one hours a week and that's why I you know if you're working if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty-one hours a week there's not much time left to spend with Yeah Yeah Yeah Well it it all paid off So you know I got my degree and got the better paying job and and you know we I think as a family we're a lot better off Uh-huh Yeah well my goal is to try to retire by the time I'm fifty-five Great Uh-huh Well I'm <>
