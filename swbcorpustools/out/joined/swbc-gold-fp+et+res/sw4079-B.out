Well I don't know that we really have a budget I have a set amount that I that I save Actually well actually there is a a way budget our money apparently The my wife has so much gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that and besides that I you know I have a set amount that I save every month Uh-huh Uh-huh Really don't need to That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Well I found that you know things as I have gotten older I am in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to have a very strict budget I had four kids and you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I set aside I kind of fence off areas of my check book For instance there are certain things that I know come up every so often Every six months I have to pay car insurance every six months I have to pay my taxes So I take a set amount I've got a money market account that I do a lot of saving in and I also have got a checking account besides that but what I do on my money market account my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month I will just take two hundred and twenty out and I put it in parenthesis I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside And I guess that's a way of budgeting Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget Not only for buying them but for keeping them on the road too you know we've got two cars My wife has a car and I like to drive pick up truck So we are on a schedule where I try every three or four years to to buy a new one And you know I am constantly making car payments but I figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments So you know I get one paid for and actually I am saving up for another one besides so it's you know it's kind of a never ending thing but you try to you try to schedule those things so that you only you're not paying for two of at the same time I guess is what I am saying Well I have thought about it but leasing wouldn't you know I don't use it for my business My wife uses hers just for pleasure and I use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away so Yeah I guess  Uh-huh Right Yeah you're right I have been know to keep trucks or cars for ten or twelve years but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill and you got to put put stuff in them you know Uh-huh Uh-huh Those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in you know it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say So that it doesn't kill you all in one month
