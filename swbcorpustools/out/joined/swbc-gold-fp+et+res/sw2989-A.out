Well Wayne I feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available How do you feel about it Yeah Yeah Yeah we went through this with our children and now with our grandchildren and I've always tried to do things with them like when you're at the little league helping out even though I'm not a good athlete myself I was able to help the coach in in just controlling the kids if nothing else and we've always tried to take our children and no- now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to I think that's just part of their overall educational process is to get out and see and do things Yeah yeah And so it's we have lived several places around the U S and we have where we've lived we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area like when we lived in Tennessee we we took them to Washington D C to see all the capitol and and things like that when they were small And it's just it's helps I think the children to when they're learning in school to say well I've been there and I've seen that Yeah Yeah So that's the type Yeah Yes Yeah Yeah we've gone through that I remember my parents didn't do all those type things and so I made a special effort with my children to do things like that And even now with my grandchildren I feel it's a very important thing to be done Yeah Yeah Well I can remember one of the things I'm most proud of is when my son was I think it was in the sixth grade they had to write a a little brief autobiography of themselves and about what they had done and what they wanted to do and I was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him A real point of pride with me Yeah excuse me it sounds like we both have colds Oh well we're Yeah well I'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of Dallas Texas So we're kind of far apart here This is a very interesting program I I heard about here on this and when I signed up for it it looked like it could be make a real contribution in participating Yeah Yeah I'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a failed savings and loan So Trying to work myself out of a job But it's been an interesting roughly nine months here and again this is our home area We've lived here about seventeen years and it's we enjoy living here It's where we originally started out and we've lived up north for a while in Chicago and over in Tennessee So wound up back about two hundred miles aware away from where we started out Well that's about all I can think to talk about right now It's been a pleasure talking with you Thank you Bye
