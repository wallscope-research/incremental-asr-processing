our topic today Right and now I'm sort of don't know if this an advantage or disadvantage My wife's a school teacher so No You go right ahead because I have a lot of strong opinions on it too My wife teaches seventh grade and you know there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system I think the I don't think the teachers get enough support quite honestly But for example my wife she has kids that are on drugs and of course like everyone she has kids that get pregnant even even in the seventh grade Plano School System But to give you an example you know one of her kids will come in and he's you could tell he was just bombed out on drugs and she sends him to the principal's office and the principal sends him right back or her right back and says Hey your problem you take care of it You're not allowed to send them home You know if you do that then your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever your your you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day and it's it's it's a numbers game I don't think that's right if they're especially if they're interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning Yes Sure Sure yeah My son had such a tough time in the school he went to but there was through it wasn't all the school's fault it was his fault also but we put him in a private school in Richardson and that that cost more that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters that was more than his college tuition was but it had to be done at least it took care of him and threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and want to learn something But I'll tell you what there's a there there are a few faults to say the least in the school systems today Yeah I think we have that problem dealing in most areas which is unfortunate You bet You bet Sure Well teachers you know they have a a tough row to hoe so to speak they just always fighting the system I don't know if it's better than any you know we came down to Texas from the New York area we were there for a short time but my wife is from New York and she was born and raised there and educated there college and everything and I think you know the schools in the east are really a whole lot better than the schools in the south I don't care where you're from And they they I don't know if they learn more but they certainly they have a tendency to learn more and in that part of the country there is all nationalities
