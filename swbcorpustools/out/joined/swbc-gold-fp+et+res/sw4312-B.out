Well I have a pretty wide taste in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to lot of different forms of music In fact it's easier for me to say the types of music that I don't like are opera and screaming heavy metal Uh-huh I don't mind music that's difficult to listen to but the the basic point of heavy metal w- which seems to be music to annoy you is gets a little annoying lot of stuff that actually has ended up becoming popular like Nirvana and you know I'm thirty so lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and and the Sex Pistols and R E M that sort of stuff R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being you know ultra mainstream at this point and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed Uh-huh Uh-huh I think it is for a while there music seemed to really ha- popular music seemed to have not a lot of point to it I was really tired of the Michael Bolton Mi- Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes And I could go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money I guess That and a marvelous hairdo Uh-huh Well i- it's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music and I like a lot of classical music but I also dislike some classical music and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music and feel that if if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time  Stuff that I like I like Bach I tolerate Vivaldi I can't stand Debussy or Debussy <> I like Tchaikovsky He can make a lot of noise when he's so inclined and some of some stuff that I like for instance Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition and that's interesting music but it would not get performed by any municipally funded philharmonic just because number one it's Frank Zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive You know we're we're much better off playing Beethoven's ninth that's right you know w- we'll do we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and and hum it and i- it it just isn't chance taking enough for me I feel that that that music should take chances in one way or another and that you know if you've heard a piece a hundred a hundred times
