Okay Where where are you from okay because I I talked to a professor in what was it North Carolina who got the the T I system and he gave to all his students So my daughter's even talked to and I've talked to several people from North Carolina I was just curious Have you too Yeah I talked to the professor and I asked him about it and he said he says I think I'm the guy that actually gave it to all my students So that's why so many people are from this college Go ahead you you first Eve Food great Yeah We have them too and I I'm trying to think which is the best that I prefer my wife doesn't like to have all that work on the very day that you're doing it and we haven't catered out very much we I always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be the man always gets that chore and you have to make it perfect I've made shish kabob which I like It's fairly easy and fast where- I guess I'm thinking of the easy thing to do for for having dinner I do cook but not I'm mostly the easy cooker You know the breakfasts and and the steaks Although I would like to experiment with the meals my mother made you know So to speak and I haven't gotten around to that yet Well she was Polish and she would make very economical ra- meals We were very poor Different rice and ham and things that she would throw things together and galunkies and all that And I would like to try that one day And she would make spaghetti with pork chops and and special meat balls and everything And my wife of course thinks I'm crazy which I may be too but Yeah But dinner parties are a lot of work Yeah Yeah Yeah Well that that shish kabob is just because it only takes a few minutes to cook you know you get it ready you have to do a lot of work beforehand I agree and buy special stuff But so far as getting out there and and putting it on it only takes a litt- a few minutes But anyway I'm I'm thinking of the easy way rather than my guests I guess but Right Right Uh-huh yeah yeah Right You'd get the odor of it yeah Uh-huh yes great yes we probably ought to try this But it probably will never taste as good as we remembered I guess it gets better and better as we remember it back as we get older you know But we probably should try it to do that The recipes are really interesting you know We're probably going to lose them and we'll probably forget all about them you know Since we're trying to make everything so sim- here I am talk about trying to make everything easy you know I you talked about Thanksgiving there are interesting meals at different times something s- my wife's from Texas so I remember we were first married and we were living in New Jersey And we were going over to my mother's house for Christmas you know to have a meal And we were on the way over we were just married that very year and she said I'm looking forward to a nice turkey I said Turkey I said We don't have turkey at Christmas I said We only have turkey on Thanksgiving I said We're going to have a ham She said What I said Yeah I said No turkey is only for Thanksgiving And because she had turkey a lot you know And that was surprising in the in the east we always had ham you know A- and and that's one thing als- that's another recipe I guess we could talk about Now the hams just kind of you know go take it out of a can or a package sliced the cans were cooked for hours and hours and and were just wonderful you know I I'd like to try that too Yeah yeah I saw them That's good No I I I've I know about Sam's My wife I think goes but Uh-huh really I haven't heard of that yeah Yeah yeah I'll have to ask her about that because we have a delivery guy that comes around that sells I'm trying to think of his name of it I don't know I see a can here or a box here of Gourmet Choice he delivers What is the name of this thing I got a box distributor marked on it it doesn't say <> Gourmet Choices But he but it's a company that has you know a truck that comes around And and they recently had hams They have steaks and and actually pirogies and all that stuff that I I wish I could tell you the name of the company but I don't know what it is But they recently had a ham that was supposed to be it was boneless and we tried it It was real nice and it was fully cooked and everything We had it for breakfast a long time It was really great Yeah I would like to try the old recipe though of cooking it and and I keep saying this to to do the different things that we did But I would like to put one in the oven you know the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours and see if because I don't think in in my married life which is twenty-six years now we've never done that you know And I remember that when I was a kid to have the ham cooking rather than that we just ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally you know And that's it you know In the old days we had hams were the meal and I don't I don't think we really have it as a main meal Right That's an interesting point How how have you changed your your meals now Have you into that looking at those things Uh-huh Parents that's unusual yeah That's amazing Yeah Well that's amazing they'd go that they have started Usually it's the younger people doing it Yeah I my my wife's mother is the only grandparent left and she has high cholesterol Of course I ha- I have too but not like hers And I always get after her about salt and everything else And she just will I mean she's going to eat the same way she ate you know her whole life And she just tells more or less tells me to shut up you know And I like to I'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way  it's it's not the I listen to Larry Newarth on the weekend He's a fitness expert and he talks about you know the chicken and the rice and everything else And and throwing away peanut butter and all the things you know the things not to eat you know ever I think the peanut butter and mayonnaise he would throw away for ever And then he's got me into making eggs without the yolk You know try that sometime My wife says she can't stand it But when I make scrambled eggs now talking about a recipe I say if I have four eggs not not for me but if I'm making four eggs even for my daughter and I I'll take out all the yolks but one And and it's fine You you don't miss it In fact when I when I make eggs for myself if I if I fry them throw them in there I will almost hard fry them so I can take not eat the yolk at all And you don't really miss it You get the flavor of the yolk but you don't eat it at all you know You don't they're hard You get like a bite at at the m- most And so for cholesterol I mean I'm trying that And it has worked My cholesterol gone down twenty points So although I haven't gotten on the which whether yu- butter or cholest- not cholesterol +  margarine and all that I don't know know whether any of that is true you know <> Whether the margarines or butter
