Okay Well Rome is pretty small But we hear a lot about New York City There is a lot of crime down there And I am I am afraid to go down there because you know I mean you hear about people getting mugged You leave your car for ten minutes and it is stripped when you come back No I have not Only to the airport No I am I work at for the Air Force So there is a base up here And Bases are pretty safe because they check your I D on your way in And Right But even so we had a at New Years we had some people come in and like attack one of the planes Because they were protesting the presence over in the Persian Gulf So Yeah Yeah That makes it bad for getting out during a fire I do not I do not know it seems to I think it is getting worse Because I keep hearing things like I when I was h- I went home my parents live in Boston But I went home and we were watching T V and this thing came on where these a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and and robbing them And it was really disgusting And my mom was like "They should just be all shot right now" And I mean you he-  Yeah Yeah They were not I think they were early twenties They were young men I know it How s- deprived could they be if they had a camcorder Those are a thousand bucks Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I wonder where I do not know I wonder where he gets it You know you must I think T V is bad Because they show all sorts of violence on Yeah They do not they do not talk to their kids and take them out And and are not there all the time so the kids are off to their own devices a lot definitely I think so definitely When you go to a restaurant and like kids are running all over the place They Yep But they Right I I see that too in the Air Force Espec- yeah A lot of especially since a lot of us are engineers where I work I am in the Air Force Yes And so people outside the Air Force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do And so all the young engineers are like well I am just going you know get it for all it is worth And that you know and I am like you are the one who signed up If you did not want to do it And Yep it is I like it a lot I like it so far Oh Probably not But they pay for my college So Yeah It Yeah And you never know who is watching either Huh-uh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh This is New Orleans I would hate to be there during Mardi Gras Let me tell Uh-huh Uh-huh I know You can't trust anybody It is it is really scary Right Right We Uh-huh Well you you hear about people opening the door and getting blown away Or people you know Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right Right Yeah I would not want to go by myself Uh-huh I think our justice system needs to be stricter I mean because everyone they do it and then they get out in a couple of years it seems like They are booked up Yeah Right I do not I do not know Because I am not real up on a lot of news things But you know you just hear about that that you know it is a lot of repeat crime And you are like why are they repeating They should have been in there longer Or It seems like a lot of i- that it is more like in Boston there was a case of a couple of kids fifteen year olds They wanted to see what it was like to kill someone So they they picked on this kid who was like new in town And they were like well no one was going to miss him anyway you know and it like that is horrible How can you even think like that Yeah Yeah Right Right for the sneakers Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah It seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of like you know be
