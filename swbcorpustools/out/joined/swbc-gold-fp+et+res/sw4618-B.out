have you every been tested for a new job or anything So it's just sort of they can if they okay not really but I've always worked on a university level but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff I don't I don't think they're very accurate because I mean I know their lifestyles changed p- prior to the drug test and I know they changed afterwards Yeah I I had a friend it didn't cause her any problems with her job but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen But what it was was she had been u- she had been in the jungle and it was some Malaria medication and she tested positive for that See I always I thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more tests How do you know how wrong they are Are they I mean is there a margin of error Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah And I I'm not so sure they are that needed I mean need a slash Ye- b if you're using it while at a job I can see a problem But the occasional person then it's almost like it's almost an infringement of your privacy Yeah Yeah Yeah And it it's like it seems like now they have tests <> I guess they can test your hair and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago So I know Yeah There's a lot of things you do as a kid that you wouldn't do as an adult but you can't say it was wrong at the time
