That's not a bad idea I that you know they probably need to change it somehow the whole system needs changing we've just got too many people in there and are putting too many people in jail that probably don't need to be there and it's another form of sentencing But on that one thing I I still think it should be a unanimous decision I think we're getting to the point now where they're going to eventually let it be majority vote And that's not going to be good No Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah Sure Yeah Oh Right Yeah the judge might know or at least it it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better if it didn't we can come back for something else or or or what we've got so Well we definitely need a change in the system and It's not working too It's just piling up on us Right Right We're just not willing to set a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes so Yeah Uh-huh Right Right Yeah Uh-huh Sure Yeah Very serious yeah yeah your right Sure Oh You bet Right Well we seem to agree on the jury thing and but we'll need an unanimous verdict and maybe let the judge have a opportunity to make a decision Yeah I do too Well good Good to hear from you Bye-bye
