Well here in Logan Utah we've got a nice little valley here and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter <> when the inversion sets in and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley Yeah Yeah Definitely Here in Utah up along the Wasatch along the western side of the of these Rocky Mountains here where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo and Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north we get a lot of pollution and it's like seventy percent of it is from cars And it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion And when we get get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above and it just sits and sits and sits and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of L A a few years ago It's not it's almost sad Because when I grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys and now it's not in the mountain valleys  They're getting serious about things like mandatory well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties emissions Yeah They've actually started doing it down along the not in Logan up here cause we're doing a lot better We have a lot population is a lot lighter up here Yeah Yeah They're ge- eliminating that out here They're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun Where they're looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust Kind of like a radar gun And Yes Yeah Do it remotely just looking at the what they do they do several different types of things Sometimes they put a source light and they look at the source light and then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it and you can look at the emissions actually And Like across the street They'll set up like a trap or something like that in some sense And they're also looking at other you know ways of monitoring this and cause they've found out something basically that and a poorly tuned car can emit something it's an incredible amount It was like four hundred times as much of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons then a properly tuned car And and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the the pollution then you know you it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half Uh-huh  Yeah And they're
