yes yes I have a daughter Yeah She's only about a little less than two years old No Yeah no no particular school I think that's really a decision th- that They well help them make in terms of you know what they are they are wanting to do You know that that's a big influence I think and You know what not only what you can afford but what what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are So you know you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do University of Mississippi well it was well it was within the state But it it was not necessarily local it was What's the criterion for choosing to go there well at the time I was thinking of going pre med and in the state they had the best pre med curriculum for the state institutions It was choice between there and a private college that was a bit more expensive At the time we really could not afford it so I ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me It I enjoyed it No No no it was a six hour drive I was it was like another world Basically it was a no it was a did not get home that often you know and at that age it's it's kind of kind of difficult sometimes Especially if you have not been away a lot that extended Yeah Uh-huh that's true Yeah that that's like you know when I went on to get my my masters I basically was you know it was where I was at the time You know I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled and I was trying to work But so when you are first going to school that you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go the computer science center north building about three years yeah I have no actually I mean I came straight from school to here So cause this was the first first real job after getting my degree After my masters My undergraduate degree was not in not in what my masters was So I made a career change basically Yeah One day I would like to you know the I I like the school where I went I mean and I would not hesitate at all to to encourage her to go there there if she wanted to Or the school where I got my masters at which which was a different school And I liked it almost as well but you know that I'm not going to hold them to that just because I went there I you know think that's If they want to that's fine but otherwise not Although I ca- would get quite a break on on tuition Yeah because they allow for tuition break for out of state students who children of alumnae Well certain schools do it This school does So It's it I I was involved in some alumnae recruiting here in town recently well last year and it was kind of fun because you are trying to to trying to get people interested in your school you know And they were this was a college night at a at a high school in Richardson And it was And there were a bunch of kids you know and a bunch of schools There were a hundred schools probably there all competing for the same kids It's kind of interesting to to to talk up you know your school And I was surprised by the number of kids that came came by and had heard of you know our school And and were interested in it you know we situations like that you don't realize you know until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others And so I I was real real pleased with that That worked out so well I think so I don't know offhand but it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there So there There was one mother who came by right even before we started who who obviously was very interested in getting her her daughter in or or having gotten her daughter in or something and she was wanting some more information But she was her her daughter was a a ma- ma- dru- a majorette or something You know a baton twirler or something and she was she was letting us know she how how good her daughter was She had cards printed up actually describing you know business cards describing her daughter's you know she had won several different twirling awards and all this and she was had these business cards she was passing out and it was quite a production I think some parents go a little bit overboard Yes
