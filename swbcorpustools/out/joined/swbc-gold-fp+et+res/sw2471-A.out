Well we haven't really heard that much in the news lately about U S involvement in Latin America since all this Middle East crisis began So I haven't really paid that much attention like since back in August when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on Iraq and the so the last thing that I remember hearing that much about is the Iran Contra scandal that happened in the Reagan presidency Can you think of anything else that's happened recently Uh-huh Well the only references that I have seen lately has been in part of the overmilitarization of Iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things and and they made references to in the past how we have given arms to Nicaragua and to other places in Latin America and that those might turn around and haunt us someday I mean not not to this large scale as Iraq but that whenever we give arms to people a- as we did and as we sold arms to pardon me to Iraq when we wanted them to fight Iran and then and then it turn around and Uh-huh Uh-huh And I know when I spent the time that I've studied in Mexico se- Spanish was one of my majors in college that there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards America about like you say using them yo- our interest there is you know what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them and that we weren't normally very interested in them and they have in other in most Latin American countries they there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries you know that they have corruption and and they don't have I mean there's just very few really modern cities Uh-huh Well that's right because that's just so much of the way that they make their money and so many communities have have to have that for farming And they don't look at it so much as you know Uh-huh That's right And I think it's really very sad that north of the border you know the United States and Canada is so different from the S- from South America and Central America There's really a disparity between the what a e- I would call civilization of the countries you know Uh-huh Yes it's really kind of sad and that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and Israel and the Middle East Arab countries and and when we have when we have a lot of problems r- r- right in our own back door  So I guess we've kind of neglected Latin America Ri- recently Yeah fairly recently Well that's really sad I hadn't thought about that in a long time Well I guess then I will go but I made me stop and think a minute about not worrying so much about the Middle East crisis I know that it's not settled but there are other areas that we could focus our attention on Well thank you you have a good day Bye-bye
