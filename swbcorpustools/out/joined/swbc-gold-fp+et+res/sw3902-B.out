Do you have any elderly relatives currently in an nursing home now Do you I have a grandmother She's a hundred and two She'll be a hundred and three in August And we decide not to put her in a nursing home She lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town and then my sister takes care of her She even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties She still has her snap She takes care of her own business This is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker but with somebody that needs around the clock care I have seen my family age I have seen them in the she's been there ten years now And I have seen them age twenty in the time and and with the expense and everything I th- I still think it is worth it if you if you had a good nursing home and they needed some quality care I would put someone in a nursing home Uh-huh well that's good that is great why yeah I am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas Uh-huh I I know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in Austin And the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you just practically have well you have to be a pauper It it takes every penny They want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care And that's the sad part about it Uh-huh I think that's what most people do You just have to give it everything away I I work at a brokerage firm and I have seen so many people that just have to gift you know their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home I can't imagine I'm twenty-nine And everybody in my family has always had we don't have any children Everybody that has has them later in life So my my mother and my father are in their late sixties So I mean they're not that far away I know It but yeah Most people aren't And that's the bad thing I would hate to have lived so long She lived by herself My grandfather passed away before I was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety ninety-one And just did everything
