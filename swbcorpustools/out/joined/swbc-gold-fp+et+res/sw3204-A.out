well about nursing homes and and older people my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother and they're just really close here And his mother has bad health too and so I go over sometimes in the day when he's at work and I help with her and bathe her and feed her And and I that's hard to be a caretaker I really believe It's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty-four hours a day i- she has Alzheimer's and does not remember a lot if anything And so she asks the same questions over and over again Which is not un- you know unrealistic and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question I some nights his mother calls me and says can your family and just bring the kids in the family and just come over and and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented She's ninety-two I think that's wonderful Well Uh-huh Yeah I was just going to say Yeah  Yes I think it's wonderful these these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily but they can go and reside there like little apartments places in between places And I like that idea if they can handle it themselves  Yeah yeah <> Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Nursing homes Visit Uh-huh They don't go and see them That's right That's right You know I I think nursing homes are are some are good I have to say that But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children  Right right Uh-huh I hope so You know it's I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there And then if you find out that they are not having good care you know I'm sure that it is just you know you'd pull them out of there so fast And and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker I don't it's a very very hard decision I think <> Uh-huh I think that's right and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment Now I know a friend of mine who had a father she brought to her home to live there but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to to help him out And that might be a partial solution or something But I personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before I think I'd ever Yeah <> Yeah Well I I think we kind of are along the same lines Good to hear from you Have a lovely day
