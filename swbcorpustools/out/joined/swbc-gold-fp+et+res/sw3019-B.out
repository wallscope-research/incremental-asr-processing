First how much television watching do you do Uh-huh That's right but do you actually watch it pay attention to it or is it more of a company Uh-huh Uh-huh okay Right Well actually I work full time and when I am not working I am running and I do not watch a lot of television and I am very selective in what I watch If there's something that I absolutely want to watch I will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off I probably watch television four hours a week max And and if if I do not find something that I really want or really want to watch well then I just do not turn it on I would rather listen to music Part of it is that I think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis and I think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in sometimes they influence us and we do not know where that influence came from Yeah right right right Of course I That's right I Well last night for example I really would have liked to have watched UNSOLVED MYSTERIES Those are fascinating to me If I have the opportunity I watch it Unfortunately I was with someone else who was flipping channels I hate that I do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor In our comedy programs although nobody can appreciate comedy any more than I can but I would prefer to find a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians Uh-huh That's right and some of those are fine programs Uh-huh Uh-huh I I enjoy comedy Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I enjoy that uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Well Yeah I watch it for entertainment but I also watch it for cultural impact I do a lot of channel thirteen channel three some of the educational channels and I watch for special programs that have special a special play a special concert I recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars and it was fabulous I was just absolutely you just held you breath in some of those and I was just it makes chills all over you So I I may or may not even look at the T V guide but if I have time I may flip through and say hey this looks good if I finish this task I can watch that in an hour if the hour comes and I do not get a chance to watch it so what Uh-huh Uh-huh <> I do too it makes me want to cook and then I eat and then I get fat so I just let other people watch then I eat what they cook I think that's marvelous Yeah yeah I took a lot of my college courses I took some of my college courses on television so that it's very successful for some of those things but I think I really got stung very badly about having influence in your life or at least I saw a very bad example of having television influence your life my husband had an aunt who was addicted to soaps and I want you to know that became the most suspicious cantankerous contrary old woman ever walked Absolutely I do not know who she thought she was but she just got to the point where you could might near you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice and that attitude being demonstrated And for her to miss a soap it was a big withdrawal And Well I do not know Well she was grumpy to begin with There's no doubt about that but but you could clearly see those influences and in my youngsters I know that one day my youngsters were watching THE THREE STOOGES and I always thought that was just casual slap stick comedy but when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench I decided that was not funny any more And I really I really feel very strong about the BART SIMPSON SHOW I think that is the kids watch that and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid I ever saw And I just I do not like it <> Mine are grown but I have grandchildren And young children around and for a four year old to think Bart Simpson is a hero is tragic Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah yeah Well I was very careful even when my kids were kids were at home And when they were young I was really did watch what they watched I was cau- I sat down with them and I watched it and if I did not like it I changed the channel for them You know I you know I distracted them changed their interest Because I just could not tolerate that kind of influence on the kiddos I just wou- Sure That's right that's right Gosh they got they are mouthy enough anyway Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah well Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure I can understand how that would happen Absolutely well I did I ran my kids to death I said hey I think that's enough television for awhile maybe we need to go outside and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company So I would go out with them now see there's the problem parents do not do that They say you go outside and play Yeah I said but but we went on field trips and we did other things And I think that was Of course
