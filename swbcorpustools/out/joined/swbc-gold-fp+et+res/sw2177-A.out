Cindy have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES that is a wonderful movie No goodness no You don't even you don't even realize it you know Really I thought it was great Yeah Well yeah and I heard a story about there's a there's a certain scene in the movie where there's where they're they're on a buffalo hunt And they have a particular child actor who's who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo And when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young's buffalo I can't remember what they said his name was But he has a fetish for Oreo cookies And he got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with oreo cookies I thought that was really funny yeah yeah Yeah the wagon the wagon driver Yeah And the costuming slash error yeah was slash error the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didn't that that the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things And they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably to age to age the material so they they did very authentic reproductions of the of the actual stuff but they didn't they didn't age it quite enough it seemed But it was a very good movie What have you seen lately I didn't see that I don't I don't like Stephen King Really I wasn't sure because just generally you know that kind of scary stuff I I just don't want to have anything to do with it Yeah I think I heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something you know  Ugh Yeah It still just seems a little twisted to me I'm not sure I would have enjoyed that at all Yeah Uh-huh Yeah yeah I know we don't see movies at the movies a lot The last we did go see DANCES WITH WOLVES and we went to see NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape and then we rent them yeah that looks really good too And SILENCE OF THE LAMBS I'm I'm intrigued by it but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet I think well now we had some friends that went to see it and they said it was okay So it might not be as I think they may be playing up some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects Now we went to see the JAGGED EDGE Yeah So it's it seems like you know that kind of the thriller suspense and not not real strange in other ways Okay Maybe we'll talk to you again Alright Bye-bye
