Well are you in the market for a new car Oh What sort of requirements to you have for your car Uh-huh Uh-huh I see Top of top of the line Oh Uh-huh Right right Uh-huh uh-huh Well I guess I'm more traditional in that I don't like p- power windows or power locks because the people that I know h- who have them always seem to have trouble with them And so I don't I just don't like anything that I can't figure out why it doesn't work And then I want you know good gas mileage and I want an air bag and I guess No I haven't Have you Somehow I just think you know I like the idea Right Right that's a good idea Uh-huh uh-huh Well I actually I don't know a lot about different brands I tend to have you know my requirements like the last time I bought a car I I guess I did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically you know good repair record good mileage and I needed air-conditioning and can't remember what my I wanted s- stick shift And so I didn't have a whole lot of choice There was one car in all of the the metropolitan area that I could find that you know was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it It it turned out to be a a Chrysler Lancer Yeah No a five speed And it basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it So I guess in this area at least you know if it's not automatic it doesn't move Well I just wanted it because again I had I guess traditionally always had a car that had one and I thought it would be more reliable  I found that out I mean you know the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when I went in to and asked and that was a requirement so So Well I'm not even sure all of them are anymore At least in this area Not that I was looking for sports cars but now the people I've talked to don't seem to have stick shift And so why do you like stick shift Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right and actually it's probably safer on you know at long trips because it keeps you more active So
