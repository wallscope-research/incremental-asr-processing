well we only have one child right now and another one on the way and right now I'm I'm all with her during the day I if I was looking for outside care I probably would stay away from professional child care centers and try to find if I was close to home relatives or people with it is same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be similar to what we would have in our own homes as as parents Latter Day Saints So so that's what I would try to do With a teaching background I've had a little bit of experience with the child day care type situations but I've seen some good ones and I've seen some really bad ones Uh-huh and everything in between yeah in most states there's nothing to regulate them This would seem to be 2 or even 3 slash units  and so Right By trying to get them to conform to concern standards they kind of eliminate a lot of the Yeah The the what am I trying to think of that <> not the imagination but the creativity in in the situation and so No I haven't We've had like people come in and baby-sit for an hour or two but I've never had Right She's she's not even a year yet so we haven't been in you know a lot of need yet Uh-huh I like that situation that's usually real good 2 slash units  Uh-huh Uh-huh Have a relative struct- a structured activities and not just you know stick them in a corner and say you're on your own Uh-huh Yeah I know that that I guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and you've got the time and that I don't know if the resources are the proper term you know just the the know knowledge of who's a available then you could probably find some really good care That's true You can get somebody maybe willing to baby-sit but actual you know that's sometimes different done on a different scale I have even considered you know baby-sitting myself I have a teaching degree and thought well you know I could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to but I think if you take more than three children in well that was how it was this Virginia we've recently moved here to Texas but in Virginia I think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed Yeah a lot of times you might just need to go now and feel file for it just like a business You may not have to prove any type of qualification for it I don't Uh-huh Uh-huh That's kind of a minimum there that you're getting Your covering basic care there and not all the extras that most people would like to see done with there children you know like the educational activities the supervised play and so forth I like that term Uh-huh Yeah it was a good influence for your daughter Well that's good Uh-huh Yeah a little bit of love and and attention is what most of them need You know even if it's not a real educated program you can have good educational program and and Right And and that's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself and so Well even educated play supervised play can teach without and I'm not saying talking about sitting down and teaching them math or or or something like that but just kind of promoting social skills and you know like my my child that she want be an only child for long but you know she was an only child or maybe your daughter not having yeah yeah just Right those basic things  that they would that you know you would be a little bit of I don't know if manners is a good term or not but you know dealing with other through proper mannerisms and politeness and so forth you know that sort of thing you'd want your child to learn that from the experience of someone else certainly you wouldn't want your child's day care person to yell at them and scream at them and say do this do that you know you'd want them it promote politeness and niceness you know the things that you would want any child to learn and the reason that's done through example you know not an actual sit down learn situation so Uh-huh it is Uh-huh Uh-huh Somebody that doesn't really put a lot of overhead whatever into it You mean somebody that has an actual establishment Yeah Yeah I know I I did that for summer so I can I can vouch for that No just he does I'm I'm here during the day with her Well we we decided to we live on a lesser budget so that we have that that's more important to us you know as as there may come a time when I will be working again you know but right now that's what we've chosen and we wanted to have several we got her and we've got another on the way and maybe another one soon after that so Right
