Actually they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting because w- when I went to work for them they didn't do that but since then they've they've started a drug testing policy not because of their own convictions but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that How about you Uh-huh  Okay Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well it's actually we do oil well services So a lot of our clients are oil companies big oil companies and they go out to we have engineers who go out to the oil well to the to the client's oil well and and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff so the clients are very concerned that you know the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they're on their their you know territory and everything but the thing that's interesting is that I w- I'm an engineer and a software engineer and I work in the software house and everybody there you know are all software engineers They've never you know they never go out to the the oil rigs or anything and yet we're getting we're subjected to this policy you know the same one that th- all the engineers have to to well a little different actually but you know we have to go through the same thing and it's but it's it's a little different I guess than than a lot of drug policies In our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you and then if you get injured on the job if you like trip and fall or something they give you a drug test right away Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that but a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first Particularly like we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol and tha- they didn't find any problem with that you know but  Yeah Yeah Yeah it's really it's really bizarre particularly like where we are you know I I there was a story of a woman last year who who actually did slip on the ice and and like sprained her ankle and she she was a personnel secretary and she had to get tested and I don't know I'm ambivalent about the whole thing I you know I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if you know they're they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense and you know it's like you're I mean employments are contractual by nature anyway but I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that where I had to do a drug test and and it's it was kind of a long story but it was it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through and it amounted to going in before any of these interviews I'm not even working for this company I'm going in for like interviews and they flew me out to Chicago and and before I went into any of the interviews they took me to the doctor to give me a physical They said it was going to be a physical you know and actually bec- beforehand they told me they were going to do drug screening but I had forgotten about that and so basically I'd already peed off in that morning and and when I got in there I didn't I wasn't like able to give a full sample and so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again and the and the the procedure is utterly humiliating You go in there with the doctor he makes you take off all your clothes and then he examines you
