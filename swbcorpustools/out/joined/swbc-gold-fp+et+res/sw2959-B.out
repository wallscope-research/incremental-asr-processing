Are you a Vietnam veteran Dudley No Do you have family who were in the Vietnam War Okay So he was too old and you were too young right All right Do you know some folks who have been there Okay Okay How did it influence them Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh what about long lasting effects on him Has he still suffering from those problems Uh-huh Well I have talked with a number of Vietnam veterans and I really I had no one directly related to me involved But my sister's husband was in Vietnam And it it really made a completely different man out of him He went to Vietnam one man and came back another not better Then another friend of mine went and he was in combat But he came back and he said "Okay that is it That is behind me I am going on with my life" Much like what Roger Staubach did He was he was a Vietnam war veteran And Yeah That is true Right And but most of the folks that I have met that were actually on the land or in combat are still still carry a lot of anger They really do And I I I I really do not think that we did those young men right I think that Desert Storm shows a lot of learning since that time <> Yeah That is true Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Well you know one of the most troublesome things that I have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast Asians into this country since that conflict not so much that I say I do not want you here But there is just such a surge of southeast Asians It has affected the culture of this country very much Yeah Yeah Yeah Well the culture is changing Look how much more Oriental food we have restaurants now for example even ten years ago there were not that many A lot of shops are are operated by southeast Asians A lot of people have complained in the schools There is a culture change there The southeast Asians seem to be very hungry there seem to be very studious And tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them which is not bad Not really but it might in the long run you can see where scholarships for example even jobs jobs that would normally go to an American with a lesser education might be going to to some of these people here And that is all a result of of of Vietnam And and you see a lot of a lot of men that were over there brought families back and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there And I would be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now I know that there You are talking about P O Ws or missing in actions Native Vietnamese people Okay I had not That that had not occurred to me That would be an interesting concept Cambodia Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I think the terrain had a lot to do with the the success of Desert Storm as opposed to that in Vietnam You know there is incredible cover in Vietnam And you can't find much cover on in a sand dune That is right Uh-huh uh-huh Well Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh What world war do you think they found the experience for that Don't you think they learned from the mistakes in Vietnam Part of it is that part of it is technology But when when When you get into trouble like that in a place like Vietnam you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into and you say "Never more" And and you overcome those problems and you are prepared next time Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Sure Sure Sure Well I know that from a personal standpoint people was one of the finest assets that we lost We did not actually physically lose them They did not lose their lives but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had being entirely different people I had dinner Monday night with a Vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had That is a long time to suffer Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah yeah I can't yeah You bet you bet Uh-huh Yeah Well you see that is what the veterans are so angry about now They say "Well we're going to listen to this and we are going to look at this find out what our mistakes were and we are not going to make them again" But that does not undo the ones that were done And that is what makes the veterans angry And I cannot blame them I do not know a solution But I sure cannot blame them for being angry On the other hand you know you can be angry about something for a very long time or you can say "Well that is the way it is" and go on with your life  For the most part I wish that it had not happened But it did So That is right yeah Well it has been that way for a very very long time though I can remember when I was in the sixth grade and that was many years ago We were reading about the French struggling with that in southeast Asia So and and and the Asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on There there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world I really I do not know i- we should not have maybe gotten involved But if we did we certainly should have supported our people who were there More so supported them when they got home And I am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part And I I saw the movie BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY and I think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times Uh-huh Well Dudley have we pretty well discussed the subject Well I think so I enjoyed talking to you Uh-huh Bye-bye
