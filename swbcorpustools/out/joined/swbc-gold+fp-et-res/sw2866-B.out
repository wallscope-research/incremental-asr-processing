Uh most of it is from the radio uh and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon We usually watch the local news and the uh national news both Well you can always get up and leave that Uh I just don't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper Either by the time I get home from work it's already you know time for the news to come on So it's so much easier to sit there and besides I can be doing other things and still listen to the news Yeah I think they did a great job Uh-huh And you could always find some channel that had something on but you didn't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time Yeah I noticed that one thing that T I did you know well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings and they used to have a program called T News and just updates of different things that were going on within T I Well when all the mess uh uh in the Persian Gulf came about they started carrying C N N Well now they have had so much good response from this that T I now has C N N on all the time So we can always run upstairs and you know get a quickie update on what's going on if we really want to Yeah yeah Yes Yeah we don't get it either we live out in the country and we just don't have it available out there where we are But when we did have it uh that's what we usually watched was C N N and sometimes we'd watch the weather stations Yeah Oh I get that too because I'm in a van pool and I'm in the van you know uh two hours a day an Yes yes And in the morning I try to sleep because it's dark thirty but in the afternoon uh I try to read so I can uh not pay attention to what our driver is doing Yeah are you in Baltimore itself Um Yeah I have two kids over there U- well no in D C area Yeah one works for the State Department and uh uh uh uh her husband is in the Navy and he's stationed at Bethesda an Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh no I'd rather have Baltimore with the home town atmosphere Well most of what they're talking about in Washington is the crime problems that they're having there Uh-huh I heard about that Yeah well I know both of my kids didn't want to live anywhere around the downtown areas they both moved way out I think one of them lives in Germantown and I can't remember where the other one lives Uh-huh yeah It's means they have to drive a little bit but Uh well now I think he carpools Because he's got fairly regular hours since he came back but uh now they have probably been carpooling together in fact because she had been called back up active duty And then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last Friday So I haven't talked to them this weekend I don't know what the situation is but she was We were gone Uh d- no we weren't home but she had called and left a message on our recorder but I had that from all my kids except for one So Well I thank you for calling I have enjoyed it I really do like this program because I get to talk to people from all over the United States yeah Thank you bye bye
