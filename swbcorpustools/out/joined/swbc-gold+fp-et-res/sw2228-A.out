Okay Uh-huh kind of like a domino's effect Oh No No Uh-huh No I don't think it was really corruption that caused it or within I think people just started you know not being as careful with the loans that they were making you know whenever they gave them out I think maybe they didn't check into them enough or maybe because everyone else was doing they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also so Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I'm not sure Uh-huh uh I know a little bit about it but I don't as much as I should know about it I'm a finance major here at Clarion And um I do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with a hundred thousand dollars So they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars and I think that's kind of why they were making the riskier loans because they were like oh well we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it No I don't think so uh plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in almost any type of loan and like some banks you know they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make And I think the S and Ls were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make And I think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then I don't think this would have happened Uh-huh Um I think that people just basically got tired of hearing it and it was wasn't as good news as it was I think it's still you know adding up and I think it will be for awhile No I don't think they do I don't think how they could find how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some S and Ls still open And it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this Uh-huh uh-huh I don't know I think it would be harder but I think there are some regular banks that will go down with it Uh-huh Oh yeah um in some of my classes now I was just reading I think it was in Venezuela I can't remember what company it was but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back You know and they just wrote it right off I think we've lost a lot of money and you know like we never going to get it back it's impossible to get it back Uh-huh uh-huh yeah cause you know we're talking about some peens that have just like even gave up on like getting it back and trying any more They just totally wrote it off their book Oh Uh-huh um yeah I think is it necessary to have um the backing um it's just for you know safe purposes you know in case something would happen Um yeah I ne- yeah as long as there's enough little companies we're going to have to have something Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh I think it could happen yeah I think it'll happen again but I think it will be a long time in the future before it does happen again Because I think like the bank people in any kind of people like that are going to be worry enough not to let it happen again in the near future But I think later on they're going to start and forget about and start making the riskier loans because you're going to have to take some risk and as long as their backed I think they're still going you know start taking on riskier loans and I think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until you know late you know in the future Uh-huh
