Okay this topic is is Russia a threat to our security I think they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time how do you feel about it I believe Communism is very much waning It's uh pretty much on the way out of the door insofar as the strong hold that they used to have and the Russian people are all realizing that the Communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world and their rebellions right now is the result of that If they can get the army or the military to sway to their side I think that uh it will be on the way out eventually It's just a matter of time because in the Baltic States they have already massacred so many people who protested and that hasn't set too well with their diplomacy regarding the uh outcome of their affairs What's your synopsis Uh-huh I think that it went up a thousand percent on most Uh-huh but Gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that he's moving towards a two to three party system of government nor eliminating or diminishing the Communist power and I guess that's where Yeltsin steps in so far as his politics of government goes uh but I don't know how convinced the people are of him yet myself Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh I understand Uh-huh I agree What's bad for the Soviet system is that they have the resources to grow and produce their food but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should Yeah That's probably more true than a lot of people realize Uh-huh It seems to be headed in that direction too Uh-huh Well their knowledge with uh better communication processes in this world now that's reached them is more educated to the uh ways of the western world and uh I think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things too They probably not enough but I'm sure I lot of it's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind of what they're missing out on Yeah I'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items Yeah what we consider just normal everyday things to them is real luxury Which is unfortunate for them and of course most of us we don't really appreciate what we've got because we've been so used to it Yeah I agree Yeah Yeah I can go with that answer too The only yes I could go to is if uh a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to a nuclear exchange but I don't even see that occurring Uh because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to I guess Uh-huh
