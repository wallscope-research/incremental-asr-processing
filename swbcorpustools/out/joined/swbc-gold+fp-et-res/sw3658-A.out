Okay That's right What would we like to say I think Uh-huh I think that's what the subject is about In the MORNING TIMES I guess I did not Well it's been interesting that we Yes So we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them on polls will uh say that they think that everyone has a right to health care And yet I don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it Which is why people are talking about we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair You have health insurance Through your company Oh my goodness That's must have been hard How was your care at Parkland But yet Parkland is not free either Is it affordable So you did have a good experience Is your wife better I hope I'm real sorry Sure listen; is this a question It does happen but it's very sad Well so am I Actually uh I'm a pediatrician and I feel very strongly about uh children and uh developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year Where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most So uh I'm really quite active in trying to uh be proactive at least for children's issues It's very complicated but uh I strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization glasses hearing aids basic health benefits Um Well and so much has gone up so much The cost of immunizations for example uh and just the legal benefits uh that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily et cetera So well I don't know it is interesting in case you didn't know Texas leads the nation in uninsured children Thirty-one percent of all Texas children do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid So uh one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care And I work in the children's Parkland system and it's pretty overwhelming to me But uh it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county
