I say they uh probably the best things to do is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water if they sink they're innocent right Yeah Uh so uh how do you feel that's of course being facetious but Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh And I guess also what the system will absorb Probably more tuned in to that Possibly though on uh capital cases like maybe the death penalty uh I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole he could have like a personal prejudice You know judges are people like everybody else even though they're supposed to be impartial but maybe uh I think that's the way it is Uh they decide whether or not uh the accused or whatever would uh get the death penalty Do they have a death penalty in California Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I something like that I've got no problem with it Uh I guess the way I think about it it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge It's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people put it to sleep you know Just get it out you know it's not able to fit in you know Yeah Yeah exactly Uh I guess kind of the way I think about it also is they just if somebody gets the death penalty they're judged guilty they got the death penalty they should have one year and one appeal Cover all their bases with one appeal and if not you know don't let them sit up there on death row for you know fifteen years Uh-huh Yeah that Yeah Oh I'm sure Yeah Uh-huh I believe it is in capital I think in like uh lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever How ever many is sitting on a jury I believe that's the way it is But I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases Uh Uh-huh Yeah Oh no I'm telling you go one way or the other that's probably an expensive trial Uh Yeah Probably Yeah Probably You know I'm not sure there's a number It's probably like thirty forty thousand dollars a day you know worth of all the free for all Yeah Yeah that's been so long I've practically forgot who Noriega was you know That has been going on My uh cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami Yeah So she follows that stuff pretty closely But uh Yeah she's not involved in that case But she does No I haven't I never have My wife has but I haven't Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh
