Uh-huh Do you We have a very detailed budget Because my husband is a finance major And you know we have money that we take out each month uh you know for food and for gas and things like that And then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for uh other things Then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year and we budget them into what we call our needs and wants list And so uh the things like a vacation We have a vacation fund We have a fund for the things we need And then for the things that we want uh and we're continually putting into those you know each month how much we're going to need and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item So we very rarely buy anything on credit Everything we buy is paid for <> Right Right Right Uh we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money Uh instead of just writing checks for things If we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here And we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for uh the vacation That we put in for Christmas Well a lot of that uh I don't know how safe it is I guess uh we keep it all in a safe here at the house And so it's actually pulled out Then we keep our we have a savings account for the kids' <> education That money goes into there Each of our we have three children So they each have their own account That money is put into each month He does somewhat Yeah He does somewhat Uh we have an investment plan Yeah I guess he does But uh we have really found this is the first year we've done it this way And we are really saving a lot of money Christmas birthdays uh car maintenance dental medical we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental uh and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from we have it you know And when we see something on sale uh instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up you know kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill Everything's taken care of And we're finding that we even have more money than we thought Yeah I do Uh-huh All the money All the money is turned over to me Yes I have a set amount It's very generous and I usually have extra And so then that can go uh you know either back into our checking account or I can just carry it over Uh you know there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months And certain times when that will be left over But that's completely up to me how I do that And then uh because I don't work I stay home And so it's kind of my money and I also get my own money to do what I want to Go to lunches you know and do that kind of thing We have a clothing uh envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing It really works out great We're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that And we're Yes We have a household budget Like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year And also we need a new bed And so we've got both of those budgeted and we put a certain amount in each month and we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those And if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards
