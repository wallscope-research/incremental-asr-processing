Okay I don't know which end do we push but okay Right yeah That's true you know a lot of people uh uh I think that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more uh the party type followers the guys that uh you know follow the party lines you know and they you know just go in and if they're Republican they vote Republican every year you know and uh the people that are independent you know are the ones that uh don't really uh show up every year because they can't seem to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate Yeah Ye- I always thought back when Anderson was running I was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes but um that didn't work Uh-huh Yeah yeah that's uh and then people always get upset about it too because you know every year the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote they each think that uh if more people vote they'll get more votes huh I'm always amazed that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know Yeah well that uh I know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a predominately Catholic type area and when things start uh when abortion comes on the issues and people just get all inspired you know and uh still on the other hand we're also uh this particular community is a Catholic community but uh uh down in D C where things are a little bit different uh you know it's women's rights and that sort of movement and so it's uh quite the opposite so elections start getting very uh the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones But uh Yeah I can understand why some of the rural areas the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for the Midwest and uh it doesn't matter who they put in office they're going to fall subject to uh the pressure that the lobbyists can put Right Yeah Yeah Well I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year I think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected Uh Uh-huh Unfortunately that will probably even drop lower the voters turndown even more because more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot so they won't even bother turning out They'll just say oh well you know the Republicans have this election we'll see you in four years hope some of the local well that's what they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the booths they say that these older voters that uh you know they feel like the kids are running the country so they don't come out turn out to vote and they're the ones that uh you know really know what's going on have the experience and seen you know how politicians can you know screwup or what ever But I know my grandmother hasn't voted in years Yeah wonder if they're going to take into account this computerized conversation that there's little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time your talking No I can't hear them Oh yeah Yeah Uh Washington D C Uh-huh Oh okay Well I figured with Texas Instruments they'd probably have a few uh Texans on the line now and then No huh-uh Um they went through engineering companies and uh we're communications I work in a communications company Yeah sort of different They called me at uh ten o'clock one night that was very strange I guess they were doing Eastern Standard Time I was like I don't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes Yeah Uh-huh Okay Yeah Okay well if your ever in uh D C come look up Wayne Sherman you'll say oh yeah talked to that guy Oh Okay Yeah yeah so do we Yeah right next to Dulles All right I'll talk to you later Bye-bye
