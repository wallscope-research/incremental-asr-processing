Okay I guess we're set Current events Television news Is it uh C N N or HEADLINE NEWS or just local news or Right Right Right Well on commercial radio I guess I tend to get more of my news from national public radio of the morning on the way to work or evening on the way to school So uh I don't see much T V mostly when I'm in school but I do here Uh University of Texas at Dallas Right Really I do tend to throw on HEADLINE NEWS when I'm doing things around the house and just let it play and listen but uh Right Yeah all I ever get out of the paper is a Sunday paper so I read the comics That's about it yeah Right Right I like to listen to uh national public radio on the way to work because I don't know it's variety and now they're throwing in a little news and a little bit of other stuff It tends to get like HEADLINE NEWS if you listen to it for an hour Yeah it usually is They throw in you know a lot of interviews and commentaries It's kind of like getting a newspaper There's a lot of sections to it and they present different sides of things Oh well they spend a little more time you know they cover the headlines and then they go into a lot of the issues and things where they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and interviewing people And it's Yeah Yeah and only in the morning I guess there's a little bit I haven't listened to a top forty radio station in so long I wouldn't know So And I guess I get some kinds of other you know business related news through trade journals and things but Uh Right Yeah a lot of people are Yeah where nobody wants to sit down and read it takes a lot more time to read something and you've got news bombarding you from everywhere now You know you turn on the T V turn on the radio Why is that Yeah I just I find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television just given the way society is And I enjoy reading but most people would rather turn on the tube and flip through the channels you know and get the headline news at thirty minutes of Right And they don't have to go get one you know Right Right Right Well that's why I like uh national public radio because they get on one of these little things they give you headlines that are brief just they touch on what's going on And then they'll get into something and really explore it And it's informative It's a lot more informative than you know quick half hour news shows that they tell you what they want you to hear Right Yeah there's so much going on in the world Communication you know expands the world now There's too much going on You can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there Yeah And the question is how some of it I guess there's a lot of debate about censorship and what we're really seeing is it the true story or is it a little bit biased Right Right you know I like to know what's going on Sometimes I think there's just a little bit too much You know you get in the habit of like I say turn on Headline News and it will play over and over and you just tune it out because it's the same thing but Yeah they tend to dramatize things Yeah Like who cares Really Well Yeah Trying to do some C programming Okay Take care Bye-bye
