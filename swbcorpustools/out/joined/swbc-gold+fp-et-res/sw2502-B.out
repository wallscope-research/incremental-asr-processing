Oh I'm all in favor of it yeah No uh I think we've been doing a pretty good job you know uh not taking advantage you know of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us you know uh we could direct the government even more than we have been I don't think we've been doing too bad Um Well I think uh as a whole that being that the drug industry can uh bring so much money to a country I think that if it wasn't for the United States Government matching that the drug uh cartels or whatever would control most the Central and Latin America Just that uh money is power and uh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Exactly Yeah But uh Yeah Well sometimes that's America doing that too you know we fall out of uh agreements with certain leaders and then amazingly enough the country starts turning against our leader you know It's uh uh that and yeah America starts talking then about removing bases and whatnot and stuff like that and people Right Yeah I think that has a lot of things to did with uh um Yeah that was uh I'm really wondering whether that's going it settle down or not because on one hand you have you know that you know the Soviet Government of course mistreating a lot of the uh Slovak countries and then on the other hand you have well they were feeding us you know so uh I don't know really what's going to happen Oh yeah I think we're getting quite a put it this way I think no I think the people are revolting themselves and we're uh allowing it to happen Yeah Right Uh-huh Yeah I think uh Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive you know where it's always the minority that are trying to make the country better I thought it was the other way around They were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this so all the persecution that they're sort of use to it it's been sort of like you know I don't quite understand that Do they even understand what's being said Oh yeah the old church Yeah Well they actually understood it is in America where it was hard Latin you know is very very very close to Spanish Yeah Uh Yeah Uh I never really thought of it that way I don't know could be the economic still You know the there's the poverty level is certainly uh you know much worse in the Latin American countries you can say that about Africa too I think it has something to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic uh country and yet you know they have the same problem where you know where kings and such Well in South Africa yeah <> In South Africa I think they are but yet you know Idi Amin was you know in power for so long Uh racial I think <> or like you say maybe communication of knowing that hey up in other English colonies or previous English colonies everything is equal and yet down there it's not you know I think communication does have a lot to do with it <> you know in education maybe I don't know about education because the black community is still not very educated down there So I think it is communication it's just oopsy Uh-huh Yeah that's true You know that I don't know whether uh actually I've always wondered how the education system works in the Russian countries the Republics you know Really That's good <> in a way You know uh something we compete with Uh and I've been sort of disappointed how that they say literacy rate has gone down you know that's sort of upsetting to think that we're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer In our country yeah that is really upsetting and considering it's free you know good education is really still free Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh slash error Uh-huh b Uh
