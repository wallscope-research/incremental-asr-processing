So how do you feel about it Yeah I myself almost uh am in favor of it Uh I work at Honeywell and I don't know I went through a standard drug testing thing before I was brought on I think that's pretty standard At least at Honeywell it is Uh I think it's important to insure the quality and uh I don't know almost the goodness of character You know that kind of thing Where do you work Oh okay Oh okay Huh Oh great Right Uh-huh Yeah Yeah And that definitely happens you know the drug tests sure they're accurate but there's always that margin of error And that's something to be aware of Another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate They aren't that sensitive Like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they going to do about that You know I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for Honeywell and uh uh you know I know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something Uh I'm sure they screen for just a particular few types Although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for Uh I don't know what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon Oh okay Great Uh yeah I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida University of Central Florida And this is actually a an internship up here But uh uh even for interns they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing so Right Uh they essentially no I sure don't <> <> uh uh they essentially uh made me the offer and then uh did the drug testing thing after that So uh it was one of those things where you go through the general battery of all their tests and then they essentially give you the offer and then at that point they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that So uh there's some noise on this end I'm actually in a mall calling so You probably wondered huh But Yes That's a good question I believe from what I remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail I believe they give you one more chance They probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it But uh you know once again those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know But uh wha- are you working right now anywhere or Okay Oh okay Great Yeah That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know was going to Honeywell A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there And he's doing an internship with I B M And uh they basically uh did the same exact thing Uh we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug testing <> at the same time So one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process But uh No no That's one thing they don't do is drug testing while you're on the job Uh I think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it but they don't do it You know so That's good I guess I don't know uh I have gone to a couple of parties since that time and while I don't do any drugs myself I've seen some people who work there uh you know smoking a joint or whatever And uh you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up you know But no they don't really do that So Yeah
