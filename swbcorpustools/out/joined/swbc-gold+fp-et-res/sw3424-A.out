Okay um do you participate in family reunions Uh-huh Did you uh were they far away were they close Uh-huh Oh how neat Uh-huh Oh that would be fun Yeah well uh we have a family reunion on my mother's side of the family that's uh oh it started probably about forty years ago uh because I remember going as a teenager before I was ever married and then my husband and I went uh while we were still dating and it's still going on and it used to be held at Lake Brownwood down at Brownwood Texas but now we hold it at uh Lake Texoma so that the Oklahoma group doesn't have to drive as far And uh we have had as many on a Saturday night it starts on Friday and goes through Sunday and we've had as many on a uh Saturday night as about two hundred and fifty Uh-huh Yes and we took uh our family all brought in food and everything Oh uh-huh uh-huh Well I know on Sundays we all elect now to chip in and we go get Kentucky Fried Chicken and bring out uh but we kind of take our food for three days and uh now our grandchildren are participating in it and just love that they have all this little batch of cousins that they get to see about once a year enthused and with it and our children you know thoroughly enjoy it So it's been kind of nice It started out when I was a youngster and watching my mother Now I'm to the mother was and uh I am uh now the older generation and doing more of the cooking and watching my daughter you know more and everything and uh Oh my word Oh uh-huh Oh are they Get together any more Uh-huh uh-huh I do think now we have noticed a waning of interest and as parents get older and start dying off I think sometimes it is hard to keep the interest going Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah you probably do good just to get your immediate family together Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah they're a lot of fun Well my si- I have a sister and then we have a son and a daughter and we have three grandchildren and our son and daughter are both married and uh our son's not as interested in it as our daughter but our daughter is really interested And uh I beg you pardon Oh a little bit I wish that our son was you know uh but uh the cousins are closer to our daughter's age than to our son's and just totally different interest group and plus and he's newly married and doesn't have children and you know I'm hoping that as they you know are married a little bit longer and have children that they may be more inclined to want to go you know to it I know that Well talk to them about it and you know tell them some of the things we're doing Now when he was a uh oh preteen you know when he was like ten or twelve he loved going he had another cousin he was close to and went but that cousin kind of quit going and as he got to be a teenager uh he wasn't quite as interested He was more interested in rock and roll and this is more country western group and uh just lack of interest
