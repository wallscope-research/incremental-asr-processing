I'm sure well actually probably any government but the federal one's the big one uh so what do you think in the short term we should be doing to improve it Right Right Yeah Uh yeah I'm getting kind of disgusted with uh uh you know the fact that they're counting a reduced deficit as being some big step Right first of all this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever and two the deficit is as far from a balanced budget you reduce the deficit you're still overspending Right it's just the amount that you're overspending and this is you know for some reason the way that the reporting is going on now it seems like the goal is to reduce the deficit to some you know still outrageous amount um Yeah I think in the long term something is going to have to be done with uh sort of the uh well it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process right that you've got uh people you know trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected And uh there isn't any sort of overall accountability and uh I don't know I suppose that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're going to have is exposure and information And I don't know that in general the American people are that interested you know to listen to as much uh uh you know you're going to have to know what people are doing uh you know and how partisan and how self-interested their motives are and take it to task for it because it's not going to get solved you know if people are still trying you know like you were saying you say you know hey you know we just cut defense let me grab some of this money for my state now and then we can throw in some highway bill or you can throw in you know some other kind of thing and uh it's a pretty uh vicious cycle I don't know That's yeah that's being batted around my dad was always a proponent of that he felt that that would get people involved who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Right Uh-huh yeah Right Yeah yeah I think that that's probably right because in terms of long term you just got to get people um uh at one point at least on a local level um going into politics you know what you're doing is really trying to serve the community right you don't expect to make any money out of it You know maybe you gain a little bit of local fame but uh you put in a lot of work in exchange for that And I don't have the feeling that national level politicians are at all like that Yeah And uh you know I think that the problem with having you know junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time uh you know with inept politicians or people who don't know how to deal with it But on the other hand maybe that's
