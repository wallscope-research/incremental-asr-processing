Uh-huh All right Yeah uh I was read- My community that's cute I live in a place called Dye Mound Or Dye Community And it's not a city not incorporated my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least I can't even see their house and uh Yeah uh I'm out in the wilderness Literally And uh well give you an idea it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the asphalt we're out there And uh I do some interesting recycling things I'm building our house right now and I'm going to incorporate into my uh garage area a weight activated uh crusher So when I drive the car in the driveway in the afternoon it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the uh pressure side of a uh hydraulic cylinder And the weight of the car will crush what's ever in the disposer hopefully it's not my wife Well I thought you know I'd use it as an escapement type thing I don't know if you're familiar with that operation but what you do is you just build up the pressure and then you go over and release it and then it just drops you know Very similar yeah Well what it will be you drive up on the jack but it won't go down Until you pull the pin yeah Anyway I have another uh recycling method I use You know all that junk mail you get The glossy paper that says buy this and send off for that and you have won and all that Well anytime they send me a return envelope I put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that I you know happen to gather up Because uh well like I say we live a way and when you throw trash away you throw it in my yard And I don't like that so I don't do that So I take it and I mail it back to them I've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff Yeah Well I think one of the best ways to uh help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items For instance uh I saw a thing on uh NOVA I think it was the other day This guy has designed recyclable items Whatever he makes it's all out of the same thing See so plastic it's all out of plastic If it's metal it's all out of metal he's a engineer designing stuff and incorporating you know reusable materials into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a broad scale Make it financially uh attractive to recycle and somebody will find a way to make money at it And Well there is a guy in Dallas that's all he does He collects trash You know and Yeah well he's out for cardboard
