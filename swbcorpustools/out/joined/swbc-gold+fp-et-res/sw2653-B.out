Uh-huh I could never justify owning a personal computer at home uh that's quite an expense to look for uh well who is this what do you use yours at home for Okay well now Uh-huh Oh Uh huh well uh well I'm a electronics tech Years ago T I sent me to their uh computer school down in Austin So uh I learned to repair one but you know I never really learned to operate one Yes Uh-huh Well uh space is a handicap with me I live in a motor home And I'm preparing for retirement And I'm not to far from it another year and a half Yes definitely but just like the computers Uh remember how they started out running three four hundred dollars calculators I beg your pardon You're kidding Including a printer A hundred Wholly smoke a respectable one Well see of not being particularly interested I don't keep track of prices on them but that does amaze me Uh-huh Huh Well what is a good brand a inexpensive Uh-huh Oh wow Uh-huh Uh I see How do you go about getting one of those a catalogs Uh-huh Uh-huh well getting back to the P Cs I'll tell you I ya first of all I don't like a machine that's smarter than me And secondly I did learn this much about computers they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten In binary Well anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes One and one equals ten Course it's kind of an inside joke you know You can only tell that to somebody who understands binary So what do you uh uh work with a computers at T I Uh-huh Uh-huh well I just recently started using one In connection with my work Uh I keep track of an inventory here And of course now that is where a computer is very handy And well it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated See I'm with the Q R A lab Qualification and evaluation so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated and they're dated So I have to keep up with them uh and it's very handy doing it on the computer I just run a printout every week and it puts me right up-to-date what I have to do what I have to ship what I should be expecting to be returned So a it is handy And I must admit that up until I did start using one uh I had very little interest in computers But they are amazing I think we did Yeah Mike you take care now Good luck to you
