Okay um I have two children and they're older now but um I found it very difficult to find good child care when I was looking for a place to for stay while I thought school and um I wanted when they were babies say till they were about two years old I preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home and that's what I looked for and I was lucky enough to find one right across from my school and that worked Yeah that worked out real well but when they got older I wanted them to be in a school type situation I think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and be around kids their own age because I think that would prepare them for school also it's real important that they do that um that they get that preparation for school so but I had I have switched schools several times because I really didn't care for what was going on at that the school I wanted them to learn to play I didn't academics forced on them at an early age Yeah for the kids Yes Uh-huh Okay Oh Wonderful Oh great Um Great Oh that's wonderful Yeah That's wonderful Oh great Right Oh that's wonderful too Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh that's wonderful Oh dear Sure yeah Oh you know that's an ideal situation but not many people can afford something like Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Right Sure Oh I do to Oh yeah but they're are just so many people out there that aren't that uh lucky uh uh because I'm a single parent and I uh you know my ex-husband and I got a divorce um when the children were small and so I uh was a teacher I uh still am teacher and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was what I wanted where I could have piece of mind when I taught school transcriber spelling error--"piece" should be "peace" and I knew my kids were being taken care of Yeah and uh plus I uh wanted them to get something out of it I just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and that's it Uh-huh Right Sure Well I agree with that Well the thing is I teach this grade and I can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other children and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically because there's to many things in their way to should be too and so I want my I wanted my children and they did learn to get along with other people Yeah and I feel a lot of maladjusted adults and I bet if we trace back to their early childhood we could see some you know times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with people Uh-huh Uh-huh I bet you could too because you know kids have to learn how to get along with other people and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really you know good adults or successful adults I should say you know really but uh it is a big problem and you kno- I have lot of friends right now that uh have young children and they daily have problems with whoever is taking care of the child or they switch a lot which is not good for the child either So you need cause you need that consistency when they're young like that and it would be ideal like you hope when you have children your wife gets to stay home I would have given anything if I would have been able to stay home with my children Yeah you Right Oh great Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh that's wonderful Oh great Um You're very wise Uh-huh Sure Sure Uh-huh Oh don't they though that's what I have right now  Seems like a slash should be placed after "though"  thirteen and a sixteen year old Oh it is they really are expensive yeah Exactly Well and they most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars So you know right now I'm looking for a little truck for my for my son so that you know an older truck so I can afford it but you know I just look forward to him helping me out because I for years just car drove in carpools all over the place And it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store will you take his sister somewhere something like that Right exactly Right That's right It does for ever And then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren so It's not ending is it You think we've talked a long enough time Oh they come in see this is the first time I've done this Oh in ten minutes you have to talk that long Uh-huh Oh I see I see Are you from the where are you from Oh my gosh I'm from uh Plano Texas which is outside of Dallas Yeah because that's where T I is That makes sense
