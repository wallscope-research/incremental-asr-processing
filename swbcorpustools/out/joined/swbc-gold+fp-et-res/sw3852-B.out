Okay Well Larry my last one unfortunately was an expensive one because I had a brand new Lincoln Town Car and a couple of ladies ran a stop light the lights weren't working properly it wasn't their fault but they didn't run it We both had green and she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car so That was a huge repair bill I know I hated that So it wasn't enough to total it but that's been my most uh expensive repair probably in the last year with the except of just service work because I buy a new car every two years and Well I travel a lot so you know uh this last one I leased so I don't know and I leased it on a twenty-four month program First time I've ever done that But I'll probably go back to buying them because I don't care to lease them No it has the expanding balloons Uh it they didn't go off No I guess we weren't going that sort of upset me we weren't going fast enough acco- when I called the dealership about it and called Ford Motor about it but no sir didn't go off uh we were it was a bad rainy dark dreary day and the street lights Yes Yes Took off my whole front fender and hood and everything I tell you just took it all off It was uh uh my doors were okay front and back but it did uh right eleven thousand dollars in damage It was a expen- then I get it back and two weeks after that I'm driving it in front of the local high school and some young man just wasn't paying any attention and runs in the back of me That's another twelve hundred dollars worth of damage So I'm going to get when my twenty-four months is up on this car I'm getting rid of this car My golly How about you Larry I understand I understand Sure I understand that because I'm from West Virginia and we had the same thing up there continuously salting the roads for snow Sure No I'm going to buy it Larry I don't like the rental I think I'm getting ready to retire myself and I'm going to be you know driving a car for longer so I usually drive a car for three years but last couple of cars I've only driven for two years and so I'd leased this one for two years So I'll probably go back and buy one and uh this next car will probably be my retirement car Well no sir Not really not really uh no problem at all My wife and daughter we have uh two Toyotas in the family one Nissan and then we have the Lincoln and the not really no problem there at all as far as finding parking places it's convenient in that regard Yes it is and I travel I'm like a traveling salesman don't travel a lot any more but uh when I do take it it is very comfortable to drive Yes it's Is that right Well my wife's Toyota is soon to be four years old it doesn't even have thirty thousand miles on it so gosh been in such good shape that'll probably be an eight or ten year car
