Well let me preface it I'm a I was a staff officer in Vietnam in sixty-nine and seventy and I'm in active reserve now so uh I'm probably not going to have the you think I would have Uh it's I was an interesting in that I think that he gave the American people uh uh a sense of the fact that uh wars are really run by politicians I> It Uh I are you old enough to remember the war Yeah Well December seventy-two was when we bombed North Vietnam and then they released the prisoners in early seventy-three in that time frame I think the significant thing is today uh did you see Barbara Walters interview with Schwartzkopf Well what's your perspective on it Yes Well well the difficulty I have is that uh are we our neighbor's keepers And this is what I find particularly difficult in that uh if we see injustice and weather it's in uh you know Chicago   or + uh typo weather> whether or  + or  Dallas I think if we see it you know we see John Wiley Price hollering injustice I think that's wrong Now the question is was there injustice in Vietnam or was there injust in Iraq Kuwait typo injustice the difficult point is to where do we step in uh and I think that's the part I have difficulty and the the other part is when your looking at Vietnam and you say well is fifty-eight thousand lives worth it 3 typos your> you're And I don't know that anything is worth fifty-eight thousand lives Well the other issue is uh how do you allow injustice Just like the policeman in Los Angeles how could could you stand there and watch them beat that guy If your brother or your sister were being beaten by the authorities do we step in Well In some cases we would and I think that's what makes it so difficult Yeah but the other difficulty is that it's just if you take the to feed my sheep and the question is who are my sheep and the idea do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry Yes Uh they did but I think the biggest difficulty is that when your at an economy like South Vietnam well then reality uh the the poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes your> you're and the question is who was he going to pay it to Uh the communists are all alleged democrats Uh democratic formed government and I think uh that's a little difficult part there and I we didn't understand the culture We couldn't uh uh we had a young lady that was fourteen that worked in the unit I was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old and the people looked like children you couldn't imagine that one would conceal a bomb and do these kind of things I think socially it really destroyed a lot of the people that went over and saw these people You just couldn't believe that they would be mean and drop bombs and kill people and then we would turn around and nay palm them you know typo napalm if and I think there was a lot of tearing of emotions and I think that if anything that when he was saying the idea that we learned we learned a lot from Vietnam now it was in general bad and I don't know the problem is now I'm concerned a little bit that now that the gulf war is on that we're going I think it was a good war and it was okay to go beat up on people and I think we need a little more justice at home I'm not sure how we get that wonder if there's a connection there but Well the difficulty is if you look in the old test meat and in the numbers of places that uh the Lord went out and just simply struck down old test meat = Old Testament and that was part of the problem when they went into the promise land  should be promised land uh they didn't destroy everybody and that you know and you I think that's one of those things when we get to heaven we're going to ask God Why did you do it that way Yeah Well and I and even at the local level when somebody's assaulted what do you do turn the other cheek Yeah
