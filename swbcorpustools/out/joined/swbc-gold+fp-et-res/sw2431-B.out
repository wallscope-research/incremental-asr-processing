Uh no I think that maybe the automation people that are very discrete Or not discrete electronic devices and is he the one that got you connected with us Okay It's a lot of fun You want to punch the button and go Yip Well are you going to buy a car soon And what are you going to buy Well have you been listening to Iacocca's arguments uh that Chrysler products are the only ones that all have air bags Does that make a difference to you Yeah like what Yeah That's did you see the uh I don't know if it was TWENTY-TWENTY last Thursday or Friday night on seat belts Did that scare you a little bit With the lady being thrown out and run over that really sc- I that a little more than scared me that irritated me uh that because it surely didn't come as a surprise that if the door came open the lady would fall out and uh no probably well I might the problem is I'm really into cars and so it's not a uh for me it's a real consideration uh uh and uh the but no I probably wouldn't have even though I'm really quite into cars it's probably my main hobby Yeah Uh-huh Yeah yeah you know ROAD AND TRACK had some articles on and particularly with back seat uh with some were sitting in the back seat with seat belts on and they were thrown forward into the front seat and there was enough stretching the combination of stretching the spine to uh the serious injury even though they were still locked in the they were forced to go so really if your sitting in the back seat your better off not to have your seat belt on if it's just a seat belt We have a van that uh just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness I have an Arrow Star van we really do Uh it's a mini van we've had it goodness in May will be five years and uh they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty And the transmission was replaced but they really are nifty uh the mini van it's actually we had a station wagon before and it's a foot or two shorter than a we had a regular size station wagon and it really uh we like it the interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well but the did you go to Florida in a van Yeah Yeah what kind was it what was remarkable this van even with the we have two kids and we went to Disney World uh actually I grew up in Alabama and I went to see my mother and then went on down to Disney World and it got better than I think twenty-two twenty-three miles a gallon And this was with the air conditioner on and you know four people with luggage and uh course this grant it you know it's been four years ago but it's remarkable that the bigger vans uh they're uh my boss just bought a pick up truck and uh he only gets seventeen miles a gallon But it has a big engine and it pulls a boat and stuff and it's got the seats and the other thing that is interesting is it has uh rear air conditioning And that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates Well you know the big vans are all real nice  oh those are yeah Yeah All right Uh-huh Well well the mini that you'd be surprised if you drive one of the the mini vans uh more or less alike the uh Chevrolet and uh well of course Oldsmobile has got one and Chryslers got one but they drive remarkably like cars Yeah Yeah but the little thing etched in it say objects are closer than they appear or something Yeah Well you can uh install those mirrors we've got the big side mirrors which are really nice I don't know well if you've driven a pick up truck you know these uh mirrors must be six inches across not nearly a foot high and they're really nice uh got them on both sides actually they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back But they're uh-huh Uh-huh Well they have got some of the newer ones you know with the aerodynamic features you can get pretty decent gas mileage Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Ford now announced I think in ninety-two they're going to put uh air bags in their vans uh and I think I believe safety I really do believe in this stuff uh and I think it can go I'm not the air bags are a good deal but uh surprisingly uh they're uh you really need to do you need a combination of both the air bags uh and the seat belts so Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah It would be that would do to our insurance rates you know uh if the insurance companies says we're not going to pay you know a claim if the car doesn't have uh air bags Would be interesting wouldn't it Uh that wouldn't be fair but uh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh uh I've got to go my son's in a performance tonight I have to leave in a couple of minutes Uh I think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time It was good talking to you Okay Good night
