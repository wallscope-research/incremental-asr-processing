Well that sounds good I've heard the name and that's about all it goes Yeah That's one problem with the nursing home environment the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse Uh you know they don't always have their full wits about them They're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on And it can be pretty sad I've had a grandmother who had a stroke And she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died And you know it's the type of thing that she was living down in Florida My families was up in Maryland and the other part of her family was up in uh New York state And you know it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she uh you know could not do very much for herself after the stroke And you know the nursing home was the you know best facility to put her in You know besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work and both my uh aunts and uncle work Which means it's you know very difficult for some- you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time And you know there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in the home Which makes it you know it's a necessary evil I think Yeah Yeah And you know even there you have to watch out for you know you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there and you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford to put in the uh care that they need Cause it's you know an elderly person can you know it's like a newborn baby You need to have twenty-four hour care uh answering all the needs cause they can't do much for themselves at certain points Uh-huh And you know there's a number of the elderly are very you know complaining because they remember the way that things used to be And remember being able to do things for themselves which you know they no longer can And it very very hard <> for them to accept that We just uh moved my grandfather into not a nursing home but you know a transitional type facility More of a retirement home He's got his own efficiency apartment And they provide one meal a day And you know the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him But they do have you know group activities going on Uh he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida Uh you know to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland and it's a bit of a shock to the system weather-wise if nothing else Well there was stuff like that in Florida but
