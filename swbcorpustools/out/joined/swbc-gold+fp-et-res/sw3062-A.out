Uh-huh Now is he the elementary school Uh-huh Uh-huh But he is being helped Uh-huh Oh great No that's something new to me I'm <> Oh I think I read about that in the paper Doctor Haggard is heading that up Uh-huh Oh Right so you learned how to solve your problems on your own has he had this since kindergarten or is this something that maybe learning phonetics and then he just didn't learn the right way Uh-huh Okay You're right Right Good good that's great for parents to be involved Oh how great So she was able to zero in Oh Huh Uh-huh <> uh-huh Right Oh no Uh-huh uh-huh Right but that's something that parents I think are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child So because that's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home but learning disability unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that then it makes it real difficult and this to me is the benefit I see in public schools is that uh you do have government money to fund the kinds of programs that these students need and I'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem they test kids before they take them and if they're a behavior problem they're out That and uh this is kind of a rejection type of thing and we get it even at our level in I work a nine ten school and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the uh parochial and uh private schools and uh they come in and their attitude is "I'm a bad boy" and proceed to prove it So I really hate that for them I would rather they not have that attitude but that's Right That's right Uh-huh No That's right they can be selective right Right If you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them and then compared them to the private school group then I think you would have a more equitable way And I have a problem when they compare the kids in Japan or Germany to the kids here in uh honesty the kids in Japan they have to try out to even get into to which kindergarten they're going to get into and then after uh and if you only in fact they've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten which means they probably won't get into the top elementary and high school and if they don't when they reach a certain age that's the end of their schooling and uh they don't ever really go on It's only their top ones that go on like ours do uh so that creates a problem and you can't compare because they go so many more hours The other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education and is that child That's right That's right that's right Better coping skills Yes Right Right Well and you don't see the parents uh encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or drill teams or band it's strictly stick to the educational and it's interesting to see them as they get older uh then that is the type of adult they are Um
