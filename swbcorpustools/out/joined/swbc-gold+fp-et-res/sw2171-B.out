Well uh I don't have any strong convictions about it that's for sure Um I know I haven't done any Peace Corps service and I don't know anybody in my immediate family that you know has ever even thought about it uh do you know anybody that's been it Yeah Yeah it's definitely up to the person uh so I'd have to say that uh you know the people who do it well some feel it's rewarding I don't know you know but uh I don't know how we got the subject I have nothing to say about this Uh-huh Well how long you been in San Antonio Um okay Oh okay <> And uh you were just up there then huh Oh okay Well that's good Well this is like major long term commitment like a year or six months so you're looking at the Peace Corps or sabbatical maybe or you know I don't know but uh Uh-huh But that time is minuscule compared to what they were referring to Yeah yeah they couldn't cover my hourly rate I couldn't afford it But uh Yeah Africa Yeah well I doubt that but you know how it is I it would have to be tough going somewhere you don't know the culture usually I guess I think that maybe that's why some people do it is uh to see the other cultures you know and some of that But uh to do that I don't know I'd have to be I don't know Uh-huh Well you know uh I know American Express I'm working at American Express now and they after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off like six months or something for some type of sabbatical or something like that And they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off So it is something that I think uh you know even the larger organizations will support Uh it's really for the community  to give you know to give  back to the community type of thing I don't know I think at the same it's for some people to you know help them grow in other areas Yeah m- Yeah maybe a little bit in that perspective uh and a lot of people have gone in the military you know when they're in the college Sometimes it's to help support college you know the money Uh people don't know what they want to do But as far as uh you know the Peace Corps I guess I suppose there's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives But I think a lot of it's you know when people get older they'll do something like that Yeah I don't Didn't mean to cut you off there I Yeah or try to make a living But uh yeah I don't know anybody that's done that either So I it's interesting we got this topic because I don't know what I marked off to get this but So you had the same one huh Oh well Well you'll get it over with here How many times have you talked Yeah Oh I've done maybe four or five Well she just sent me the information out I got a hold of it you know I just sent it back in and What other topics have you had Great great Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Huh Yeah I use everything with my Visa and I pay it all off So that's a good deal for me I get free money for thirty days That's the way I use them uh I try to make sure I don't get in debt So I had uh let's see I've had fishing and uh I can't remember I think me and Dana had football Yeah we did Yeah So we talked about the Cowboys a little bit And I'm out here in Phoenix so we talked about Cardinals so that one was all right And then what else did I have I think I had some other uh like staying in shape or working out I got this guy from New York so And you've probably never gardened in your life Yeah I don't have too much of a green thumb either So I do have one plant here it's been hanging out for a while but I think it's one of the easiest plants I don't know the name of it but I'm not too much into
