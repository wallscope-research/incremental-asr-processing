Well hang on let me try it again because usually um Yeah Um Well let me try it once more Well I think we're on maybe I guess we'll find out So in Maryland uh are you a Skins fan Yeah Oh okay So you were out there in San Francisco Oh yeah Oh Yeah it's um um other than uh the big catch uh with the Forty-niners and the Cowboys back a few year ago I like San Francisco But uh I don't know I never really was a Cowboys fan until I moved down to Texas Yeah I'm in Dallas and uh uh I guess when you're down here in Dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the Cowboys um because uh you know this is a big football territory down here And uh uh unfortunately of course the Cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years That uh uh I don't know everybody's kind of they're still behind them but uh it's not like it used to be That's right But I think uh actually uh in trying to follow uh you know the Cowboys over the years I think uh uh they used to have um a philosophy for well I don't know probably the last twenty-five years except for about the last about five or six years uh they always went out and tried to draft the best um athletes And didn't really put them draft for any particular spot But they would go out and try to go for uh the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche And then about four or five years ago uh they started going after uh uh specific players or positions you know like the press would get down on Landry and this is when Schramm was still there And um they'd go after them saying uh jeez what you really need is a defensive end So they'd go out and try to find a defensive end and when they drafted somebody and he didn't workout at that spot it really wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else uh so I think it was kind ever interesting I think the decline uh of the Cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with uh not drafting the best athletes Yeah yeah But Yeah Uh they still have uh some draft picks uh that they got No Actually they picked up some from Minnesota I think it was uh Minnesota's Yeah They traded Walker yeah That's okay they um um I've got a friend that uh lives right next to the Cowboys' training camp And uh uh he sees them out running a lot and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys and uh they're all thinking that uh man they really got something going this year but I guess uh when you have a whole bunch of uh professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes You know I guess it's the same way with baseball or anybody you know Spring training until you actually start going out and uh getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good Yeah really Yeah yeah really Yeah they did As a matter of fact uh Yeah Well uh you don't like the Skins Oh okay Jeez Well of course Yeah Oh yeah Yeah um of course then you're not that far from Philadelphia Oh okay I it was Buddy Ryan the one that I can't uh uh stand too much Yeah really Oh Uh-huh Uh oh jeez Yeah uh actually uh you said you lived near uh Baltimore You're out uh I used to travel out that way a lot and uh actually I used to drive a lot between Baltimore and Washington and Um no Oh okay Yeah I used to go out of B W I a lot Oh yeah Is that near the what do they I forgot the name of it Is it the the Wharf or the uh Inner Harbor Yeah Great Um Yeah I tell you what I the there's the Colts you know still to me are the Baltimore Colts You know Oh okay Jeez Yeah so uh uh you know did you graduate from Purdue Delaware Oh there's not a whole lot in Delaware Yeah that's true I take it you're an east coast type guy Plus the west coast right
