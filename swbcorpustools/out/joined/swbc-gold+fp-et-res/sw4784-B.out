What is it that you are you know particularly upset about Uh-huh What do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in the public school system So you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of uh real estate or other taxes and consequently they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen Uh-huh Right Right It troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good and by definition for some of us at least the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that uh you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes at the local level or bigger votes at the national level Uh it means that you've got to be informed and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision Right Right It has taken on a more profound and you'd think we'd notice it economic uh thrust Yeah Well I'm glad that you added that one Yeah I think that one's significant Right Well I agree with everything that you've said so far and the only that I'd want to add is that I'm a little more in contact I think with public school teachers than perhaps you are uh except as a parent of your child and the sense that I get from public school teachers that I know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing and they are the three things that you mentioned But they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related like consumer
