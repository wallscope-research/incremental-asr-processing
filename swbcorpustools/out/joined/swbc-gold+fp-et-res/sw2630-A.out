Okay he did really decide to go Uh-huh sure I'm familiar with it And well he must know is he interested in law or medicine he must have a definite profession in mind Oh okay Medium size aren't they Is he excited Wow I can I Uh-huh while they're east coast I don't know anything about their football but there you go Yeah that's where you at Oh okay I'm in uh suburban Dallas No I don't I have a husband We don't have any kids yet About all I can say is I guess about picking schools um I guess uh if you don't know what you're going to do liberal arts program is a good idea This is true Right the humanities the history yeah Right right no no no Yeah but you know if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school usually a company if it's worth it's weight will subsidize And Uh-huh this is true Yes And if you want to go away right Right Good Okay So he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at in Austin Texas University of Texas Right Texas Aqua- yeah Okay well I think the other thing is too um I know I went to a uh city high school in Chicago and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say my brother and I were and economics was the choice um sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school Uh-huh Yeah University of Penn I'm originally from Pennsylvania University of Pennsylvania Yeah that's strong that's you know and well it's a little bit I don't want to use the word wilder that's not the word I want Um more diverse At Williams or Pennsylvania At Williams At Pennsylvania Well how large is Williams Right Well that's not bad Which is a lot Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh That's the thing to do not having any children my husband was an Ohio State person and uh that has something like either the first or second largest student population like fifty thousand Combined Yeah that is too much and um I can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because I spent a year at Bennington in Vermont Um and this was twenty years ago Showing my age Yes Oh my God where are you from well let's not talk about that It's um in that area I just can't say enough about it Well you know um my husband's an engineer and a strong liberal arts background with uh a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say like a strong um business administration degree than with another M B A on top of it Uh-huh and they usually Yeah but they usually don't Right but they no but who does I think the majority of people just don't know No he looked at criteria such as location size of school uh That's still pretty far though a lot of kids just don't even want to go Oh that's not too bad Yeah he will enjoy Williams I think and is a good academic Uh-huh That could very well be and So he's developing his uh internal instincts right now That's good because I'm sure what he said was true that uh you well actually that's one of the reasons I went to Kenyon he made a good choice I went well I was supposed to but I spent a year in Vermont my freshman year it was just too far away it was too different uh the level of income of lot of the students and their attitudes was just um beyond my um in terms of drugs et cetera which I thought was shocking Right yeah you're right but then I went Yeah Uh-huh And you're going to get a little bit more input than discipline yeah Well I don't know how to put this either in this way and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this but I just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today I think the refinement that they get I don't mean specifically or culture but just what you're saying just a solid background because I just don't think at that age I just don't think that young people know what they want to do You know and um That's right Right Yeah This is very very Oh They have video lectures Yeah Video lectures This is true and that is very ironic too that your son just made the did he just make the decision today How funny That's funny It was easy for him to rule out He knew what he didn't want that's exactly yeah Now is your other we're talking about what you think but obviously you're experiencing it Uh Did your other son um A clam Oh wonderful Uh-huh The smaller and the And they'll do fine in their studies and I'm sure they'll go on to graduate school and +  I think this should be a slash unit since A's next utterance follows B's longer turn And now he's a senior should be an indep slash unit or is this early admissions So he's yeah well sounds like you have two talented sons I think and a lot of people talk about and it's not the economics I solely zeroed in on but I think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return and I think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller colleges because of that and I think it's rather sad You are wonderful parents No and I agree my husband and I in fact I'm taking my L S A Ts um I'm thirty something and taking my L S A Ts on June tenth The point being and your sons will learn this from you I'm sure that uh no matter what age you are you can learn and it sounds like they're going to you know they're
