Do you see anything wrong with public school systems I agree Yes and I taught for fourteen years before we moved to Texas and the one thing I see is changing is I was held accountable so much I had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that I was filling out all these forms for all the children everything had to be documented and I had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids it was filled with documentation yes Me too I think so too They're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now and teacher competency you know and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best she's always worried whose looking over her shoulder and That's right I know That's right Do you have children in the system Oh Yep Are you in Plano Yep I am too And I have one in ninth grade at Clark and one at Hendrick this year and my uh sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews and the very first year I taught back in seventy-three we had open classroom and it didn't work then and when we moved down here I was just appalled that they were still doing it here Partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something I know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school so he spent all day in this one large open area so I didn't really care for that It seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here That was our last tour in Michigan Oh Uh-huh Oh wow Yes Yes that's right We heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system Probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are so As a freshman Yep Yeah My daughter seems to be having a good time she was absent with strep throat the last three days and I ran over and picked up her report card and she did very good and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work I would expect for a freshman to have She's not bogged down but yet she has some every night Yes you always hear how good Now my son's at junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful but who knows what he's going to bring home
