Well uh I think she's mostly German Shepherd Uh she was uh uh a person lives across the street from me uh brought her home from work because a coworker of hers uh had this dog appear on its front doorstep somebody abandoned her and she's only six to eight weeks old and uh uh I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though she's this young and she's almost housebroken she actually asks to go out And uh yeah I was amazed Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality I don't know I can't imagine what uh would have been wrong with this dog so Uh-huh Oh really Uh-huh Oh yeah I had a uh last year I had another German Shepherd now this one was purebred and uh when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door but uh managed to get him to a veterinarian in time uh and on huge doses of antibiotics he actually got over it with seven hundred dollars in vet bills um but he had actually was able to get him over that And then he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy and uh he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a Cadillac So I couldn't believe it that was really hard And that was even harder for I was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street so they just felt absolutely awful And I felt probably worse for them than for me because oh gosh uh this fellow's wife who was uh watching the dog I think she loved that dog more than I did and uh She was really attached to it but uh it's unfortunate but now I've got another one so Uh see it was just over a year Uh it was in March of last year So uh yeah didn't have one for a whole year Yeah Right My dad's like that uh he had a beagle that he loved and uh when that beagle passed away uh he wasn't going to have another dog there's no way no and then uh the beagle died in I guess about October and by Christmas time we went down to the uh I gue- Humane Society and uh got another one a stray And she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing but mom went an Yeah Yeah it is Well hopefully this one here Cocoa will live a full life Uh-huh Yeah Right Oh Uh-huh Yeah That's not too bad Golly the Golden Retriever's are good dogs too they're kind of like get that permanent smile to them they're always happy I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy Yeah Right this friend of mine has th- well it's the same guy that was watching uh my German Shepherd when he got hit but uh went fishing with him on Friday and took he's got a pure bred Golden Retriever and then I had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing And this they had a ball romping around and you know you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in And uh this Golden Retriever jumped in the really fast moving uh river current and uh Well no actually he had no trouble at all He first jumped in and I he's just about a year old himself and never had really I don't think he'd swum before But he jumped in the river Well the puppy jumped into some of the pools but not into the I was careful to keep her away from the fast moving water 'cause if she fell in then I'd had to go in after her And up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her but uh this dog Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up and then he jumped in again and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon He loved it Cocoa didn't think too much of it though She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out I pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad but uh she got over it so Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I live right across the street from a big lake here um it's on Oneida lake and I'm wondering uh if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year I've got the yards all fenced in so she doesn't run loose but uh she could go in sometime if I'm watching her so Oh really Yeah No no Oh really Oh okay my dog last German Shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too And that was the thing I couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake it wasn't like he didn't i- normally he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet but if you wanted to get him wet forget it Yeah Right right obstinate obstinate Uh-huh I'll have to check it out I saw the uh previews for it and all and it did look like it'd be a good movie but uh really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately But I got to do more fun things Yeah yeah Well uh I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force and so I travel a lot And yeah I'm a engineer uh at the Rolm Laboratory Griffis Air Force Base up here so That's how I got uh into the switchboard project and all that so But it's nice having a dog here uh the un- uh what's the word I'm looking for uh lots of affection unconditional affection from the dog Yeah yeah No no Yeah well it's been nice talking to you we seem to be degenerating here so
