Well we've test driven the Oldsmobile Delta Eighty-eight and a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac about three or four years old because uh I get married in a couple of weeks and I have two kids and my fiancee has two kids so we need a car that's big enough for six And so I guess it was two weekends ago we went uh car shopping and looked around We found something interesting at Crest Oldsmobile Cadillac up there on Central Expressway that uh <> in addition to getting a new car there they can get you a car that's new but it's been uh a demonstrator model for two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you for a new car So they call this program cars and they come with a new car warranty and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that Uh-huh Okay Yeah Uh-huh Sure Oh yeah Yeah I think so too Well the ones that we were test driving uh were the new ones there Uh-huh Well uh <> now they may be the demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in Yeah The guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes He says it'll probably be gone in a done and it's probably gone by now Those things go fast Uh of course we can't consider getting a brand new Cadillac because those are twenty-five to thirty thousand dollars But when they're three years old they're the price already drops in half So then it becomes uh more realistic Uh-huh Yeah That's right That's right Well you can reduce that risk by uh having the car checked out you know if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this but if you've narrowed it down to one or two you can have the car uh uh checked at uh an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they don't have any financial interest in it And then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting Oh I'm thinking around twenty or twenty-five dollars No huh-uh I would think so I would think so Isn't that a good feeling That's right Well what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it Yeah Oh yeah Yeah I would think that's true Sure Right right that's fine That's right That's right Well Yeah That's right That's right Eventually Yeah the first two cars I ever bought well uh uh I've bought three cars and I've always bought them new The first car I kept for thirteen and a half years and got a hundred and sixty-one thousand out of it The second car I ever bought I drive to work now That just turned ten years old and I've got a hundred and twenty-two thousand miles on that So that's kind of in the way I've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever <> But uh <> my car is using two quarts of oil a week now about a quart every hundred miles but uh it runs fine all you hav- it's just very thirsty If I just keep the oil in it seems to be okay But you know that's a sign that I'm going to have to do something sooner or later It's a Buick Century No my fiance is selling uh a nineteen seventy-eight Cutlass Supreme that she has It's actually in better condition than my car <> And so she's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low Yeah You lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in Oh really Oh there you go Well that's fact I think you're right Interesting Okay did you use it at the car shop place Oh okay That's right yeah Right Right Yeah that's good Uh-huh Right Yeah Yeah Is that right My gosh And you laughed all the way to the bank Uh-huh Yeah Yeah That's right Yeah Such a deal I'll bet you did Well Dana it's been really interesting I appreciate talking with you Okay have a good evening Thank you much Bye-bye
