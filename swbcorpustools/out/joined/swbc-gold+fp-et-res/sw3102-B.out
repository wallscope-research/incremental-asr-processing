So uh let's see what was the topic I forgot we are supposed to talk Yeah do you have any children Oh did you Where did you go Clarion Huh uh if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place or Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I know I kind of feel the same way I just finished college a couple years ago and I uh you know it was while I had my family and everything and it was a lot harder but uh you know I went to a college that was fairly local and I feel like my education you know you get out of it what you put into it I think But you know I know it's some people are real adamant about you know going to a certain school or whatever I do not know I guess a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something I do not know But But Uh-huh Yeah Is that why you picked the school you did or Uh-huh Yeah Yeah So you lived there at school then You lived there at school Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh And that was for tuition and Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh For business So uh are you working somewhere then or Oh I see where are you going to move to Oh are you Do you have friends there or Oh I see So does he work for a company down there Oh I see Oh the big company So yeah I have been working for T I for about twelve years I guess So But I am originally from Illinois but you know I have gone to college I guess a few different places but I think you know for the most part you know the teachers have been pretty good and I have got out of it what I have put into it but you know I think that's most of it personally but that's why you know with my kids I think that you know I am just going to encourage them to go And I am going to try to help them financially but uh I think you know financially I am there's only so much I can do for them and I will say here's what you have got you can either you know go a couple of years locally and you know then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it But otherwise you can just go for four years you know somewhere and I will try to help you But uh I do not know you know the financial end of it like you said I put my wife through school too Of course T I paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff but uh it still was a challenge to do uh so I think you know financially that's one of the big aspects You know you Right Yeah Well uh since you were paid for school yourself do you think you had a different outlook on it like your grades and things like that Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh yeah Yeah Right Yeah Well see I think you know I have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it and I guess it depends on the way you are raised too but if you grow to expect that you know you kind of go there as sort of a vacation you know I that's the way a lot of my friends did it and you know they did not take it very serious I know I took it real serious 'cause I did not start to college until you know I was about eight or ten years uh you know out of what I should have been in school uh you know so I think that helped me be real serious about it And I ended up graduating with like a three point six Yeah so I you know and that was hard cause I had two kids and you know a family and everything else so I had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time But Yeah you are right exactly Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Right Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right Right Well my wife was sort of in the same situation she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go for and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it But you know by then she had practically got her degree so so you know Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I think you are right when you pull yourself away and then you get out and you say man I really need this
