Yes Uh-huh Right You have a lot of discipline They make it really easy for people uh to get credit cards especially college students I have uh two daughters who both are in college or in fact one has finished now But they both have a lot of credit cards Uh-huh Uh right And then they give you uh uh the credit limit and then you're always seemingly up to that limit Now I have quite a few credit cards that I'm always almost up to the limit on most of them And that's how a lot of people get into trouble Uh-huh Right Yeah Yeah Well you have a lot of discipline uh I'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine I've paid off about four credit cards this year uh but still I have some that are up to the limit And especially the Visa Card that you can go and get cash on And it seems like every time I'm short of cash I just go get it from Visa Uh-huh Uh Well uh you can go in a bank and just hand them the Visa Card and say "I want a cash advance" Or if they've sent you uh a number that you can use You know a personal identification number that you can use in the uh impact machines or whatever you can do that Because I have one that I don't have a pin number for You know sometimes you have to ask them for that And then I have one that uh just gave me the pin number automatically Uh-huh Right Oh wow Well they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time everybody in the world will offer you a credit card Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Well you know the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that I think we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible that's why I've really started to try to pay off mine and get out of debt Because we never know when we might you know get laid off or something Especially me I work for Texas Instruments and they've had a lot of uh you know layoffs lately You do Where are you Johnson City uh-huh I know they're selling out somebody in Colorado Springs Yeah it certainly is uh I have worked on a part time job uh where I was a collector For uh uh a jewelry company People uh that they just had this jewelry account It was Zales jewelry in fact And uh a whole bunch of peop- they have about a thousand collectors I guess And uh there's just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item and then they just can't pay for it something happens you know and you hear so many stories listening to them Like uh you know they lost their job or uh they've signed for a friend You know they got it in their name but they got it for a friend and then the friend wouldn't pay them and now they're stuck with the bill and it's ruining their credit and you really have to watch this you know Because Yeah Because every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau you know Automatically most of them do Yeah And if you're uh bad because if you know your bill is due on the fifteenth then you're not past due until the fifteenth of the next month But you know if you pay one day after that fifteenth you're not one day late you're thirty days late Right right A- a- and anyway we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of Uh-huh Well you know you can do that I believe it costs about ten dollars Oh yeah It is it is You might even find somebody's been reporting on you and you didn't even know it You know you might think you're paying something on time and you by that day and you're thirty days is not real bad though anyway <> If you've got a charge off on your credit report or something like that That's when it really gets bad Or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days you know And things like that Uh-huh Do they charge a lot of interest on that card I don't Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well always watch out for anybody who bills you out of Atlanta Georgia Or there's a couple of other places that are able to charge us like twenty-one and twenty-two percent interest I know I had a charge with uh Spiegel and I hadn't read the uh terms of the credit agreement really And uh when I did you know I realized that it just seemed like I was never paying the balance off you know And I looked at the credit card agreement one day and it was like twenty-three percent interest And that's the one bill that I hurried and paid up and I've always watched it since then You really have to watch those interest rates  That's true So anyway they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent I think in Texas But there are a couple of states that can And one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of Atlanta Georgia Well Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Wow I wonder if they
