All right have you lived in this area long Okay Yeah it's a lot warmer a lot drier too because usually about this time of year you know you see a little bit more rain by mid February we start getting a lot of rain But it Uh-huh Yeah unseasonable my wife and I we used to live in San Antonio couple years ago and it was I remember the first day of Spring it was so much ice that came down later on that afternoon and evening it was horrible Yeah Yeah well um I don't know I guess I'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather Um I like it warmer you know I like it warm but it doesn't really matter I would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly but uh Well I spent three years in Germany so I'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway But I got used to it it was really strange when we came to San Antonio it was just swelter and then we got used to it and then we went up to Dallas and it was just it's not that it's just hot or dry it's just not very comfortable it just Yeah a little bit Yeah Yeah my wife and I the last day we were in Florida we visiting uh my parents and my brother and sister we were down there and the last day right before we left I had to ride with my sister and the air conditioning went out on the car and you just get used to air conditioning all the time and this it was just the humidity was like eighty percent plus and it was just killing us Yeah Yeah well I guess I've been in some places you know where the weather was just so mild you know places like Monterey California or you know just you know so mild and then you've been to such extremes like San Angelo Texas where you walk outside and you sweat you know you're sweating you look down at your arm but you see the water leaving your arm it's so hot you just feel it pulling away bizarre Yeah Yeah I tend to agree but I don't know I think in some respects it probably more tolerable No the other topics I got one topic they said talk about the Middle East situ- well Well I've had some pretty bad I guess some pretty controversial topics so it's just like well that was my fault But then the weather's like man it gets pretty mundane you can only talk about the situation just so long Okay Bye
