Uh well I'm not sure how it is in Georgia but in Pittsburgh the crime rate really is not very high at the moment is that true for Atlanta Yeah I that's probably not true only for Atlanta but for just about anywhere Well uh the least from what's on the news uh there are very few like actual robberies reported uh uh of residences What's more likely to occur is uh uh you know knocking over a small store or a car theft you know things of that nature Very few uh assaults although on the college campuses uh there are uh cases of you know like people getting from an automated teller and you know somebody trying to device a scam for uh getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners But mostly petty things and nothing really too big Right Uh-huh Yeah uh a strange case uh that happened oh it's about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine It was a free standing machine and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it Now there's a crime for you Yeah but uh I guess most of the things that happen around here are pretty uh innocuous Although uh from what I hear in the news and I saw an episode of the T V show COPS uh one time that was in Pittsburgh and uh it did surprise me because you know they were doing drug arrests and things like that but I don't really think those things happen too often because like I said from what's reported in the news at least it's not all that common Yeah Yeah You know just to diverge a little bit uh I live in an apartment Right now I'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh and uh the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in But even so it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to like lock the doors when they go out you know and things like that Uh it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when people are here and when they're not just come in you know there's a T V and a V C R and uh they could get in pretty easy and especially uh since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open you know while they're upstairs playing music it could still happen then
