Okay Well I'm sure that uh probably every person in this country would agree with you on that Because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go Uh-huh Yeah Oh yeah no argument here Yeah well of course uh uh a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war and the inventory's going to have to be restocked uh on now I work for T I and one of the things we were told is like they had eleven thousand HARM missiles which T I is the sole supplier for and they used up two thousand of them in the war so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed that's true that's true Well of course now we used up twenty per cent of that inventory in a matter of just a few weeks and uh uh uh T I also makes the missile which was the T V laser guided bombs and a big percentage of that was expended as well that was just a matter of Uh it's called Paveway And uh a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also So those are two areas in which T I stands to gain some short term business to restock that Oh no doubt Yeah as a matter of fact in Texas um we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by a state judge and they and uh the legislature just passed what they called a Robin Hood Bill which basically what it does is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts that you know come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state that are not so affluent Uh well okay to give you some perspective this town that I had lived in for sometime in nineteen eighty-three was funded sixty-five per cent by state funds Then we had a number of education reforms that the legislature said hey we got to do this we got to do this we got to do this but they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it and they dumped it all on the local school districts So Really So so what ended up happening was a shift We went to sixty-five per cent state funding to sixty-five per cent local funding in a matter of four years And uh Oh complete It's all shifted to local districts and now even the money that's been raised for the local districts is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state That's right and I have no problem with uh a certain uh minimum level that's a standard uh that everybody uh ought to be able to have uh but I am opposed to any attempts to restrict um local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum So did I My Masters anyway Yeah That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah they had to raise uh community college taxes here a few years ago Uh-huh Yeah Oh oh I can believe that Yeah yeah Well I guarantee you'd be paying a lot more in taxes if uh the Democrats had more say Yeah I really do Yeah everybody is Well what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase to keep it from becoming even more obnoxious Well this has been really interesting and I've enjoyed our talk No uh we just say good-bye and that's it Nice talking with you too Bye-bye
