Hi Uh books actually I am reading a couple of different books uh one is uh a story well it is not a story it is a collection uh of memos supposedly written by Howard Hughes uh uh that was it came out a couple of years ago and I have just now gotten around to reading it I have had it a couple years but uh jus- Oh I do not remember the man's name he used to be a reporter for uh I think the NEW YORK TIMES or the WASHINGTON POST one of the two and he supposedly was contacted by this guy who had these memos he wanted to sell and they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the uh corporate headquarters uh in Los Angeles They on I think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something there in Los Angeles they used to have a I guess they still do uh had a uh uh big warehouse kind of thing which had offices and it was sort of nondescript uh you know for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected he was uh a great collector of everything he did not throw anything away and uh supposedly this guy had been breaking there for awhi- he was a like you know burglar had been breaking there awhile uh And had ended up he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect and uh they broke in one night and found a bunch of memos that were uh supposedly from Hughes uh to his uh main assistant back uh in the fifties and well I guess in the sixties up until his death So it's pretty interesting work so Yeah it's a little hard you have to plod through it and you know it does not have a real story or any plot you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on No I have not seen it but it is real interesting uh I also reading uh uh thi- it's another old book that I happen to have I am sort of rereading it It's uh a book about uh the Bermuda Triangle but it's a real good book that a guy uh wrote who was uh a research librarian he wrote uh sort of debunking many of uh uh the stories about the uh Bermuda Triangle You know he was thinking many of the myths of the triangle uh actually could be explained you know Uh and the reason I picked it back up was in light of uh Well when they found uh the airplanes in the Atlantic thinking they were Flight Nineteen And I don't know if you are familiar with that at all but it's uh Flight Nineteen uh was a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two Right after World War Two and they were lost and uh Yeah they were and in the book you know even he wrote this book back in the seventies and even then he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water uh because he goes through and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth And uh it's probably you know real close to what you know everyone is thinking now that they just got turned around and could not find their way back Uh no I have not Yeah I would like to too because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her you know possibilities of where she Uh Yeah Right Yeah So that is pretty much for right now that is what I have been reading I kind of like to read different stuff and uh I like to read a novel every now and then but uh I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time Yeah Yes Yeah I read that too I got it uh right after it came out My uh you know he was an assistant district attorney in Chicago while he was writing the book and uh my sister-in-law lives in Chicago and before it actually got big she sent me this book saying you might like this this guy is you know from here And uh I read it and really liked it and then about that is when it really got big And uh so I BONFIRE OF THE VANITY I have not read that although I have heard it is pretty good Yeah that is what I have heard I saw the movie and uh Yeah Right Right I know Yeah I have a lot of uh uh computer books that I do computer work and so I have a lot of those So I spend a lot of time looking through those not necessarily reading them but looking through them But I'm interested in a lot of that but uh I have got a lot of books that I intend to read but I have not been able to yet you know for one reason or another Oh gosh I do not really have a list cause uh I just have all the books out you know I have book shelves and I have them all out and usually when I am through with one I will go in and uh uh uh look through uh I have one now {A and I can not remember the name of it } that I got is the sister-in-law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or Christmas or something will send me another good book and uh uh sh- I have one and I can not remember the name of it uh it is supposed to be a mystery
