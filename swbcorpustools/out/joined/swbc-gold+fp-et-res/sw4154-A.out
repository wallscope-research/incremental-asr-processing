Well what do you feel about the um present situation in the Mideast Uh-huh Yeah I agree I think there's definitely been some changes um and I think you know the um end of the Soviet Union will definitely have it's effect on the situation Um you know in that there's not you kno- you know basically since the end of World War two there was always you know that little proxy war going on You know with um the U S funding Israel and the um Soviet Union funding the Arab countries Yeah Uh-huh Yeah but on the same token you know Israel has lost a lot of their you know value to the U S in being you know the foothold of capitalism You know in the Mideast Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah but on the other hand you know if they would have had a hard time retaliating because you know they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes through you know two enemies The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them of course you know public statements can be taken for <> Uh-huh D- Uh-huh You know well to begin with you know I pretty much question what the U Ss motives were in actually the original involvement Uh I the cynical side of me says that you know it was more for uh the domestic political situation than for anything else You know you know and for portraying Bush is a strong President Uh my gut feeling is that you know he pretty much picked the fight uh with um Hussein I'm not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to enter that fight But you know I think that um we chose to have our official feelings hurt Where a lot w- I think that um in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen And I really don't think that I think it was there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests Um Yeah And along this line since you know it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting uh the Iraqis out of Kuwait I don't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and you know in fighting a second battle Um you know uh over what probably won't accomplish much for him politically Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Well I have very fixed feelings about Israel Um I think that for a long while we've had almost a you know ha- t-
