Okay What is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling Uh-huh Well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts some local communities are very active uh in that respect and they do have bins set up But I live in a metropolitan area and uh they're not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that Uh-huh I think a lot of uh the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do something like that because it does take extra effort Whether and I know Massachusetts has a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the store and not uh that's the majority of people that I know of anyways Where people aren't really you know eco conscious It's just the fact that it's something they have to do And I'm not going to throw a bottle away it's like throwing a nickel away That type of thing But uh people need to be more conscious of it Yeah it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans Uh and matter of fact I think it took like three tries for it to go through and it's been pretty successful and people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know people would have a drink of soda instead of throwing out the window they keep the bottle so it's been a ecologically sound policy you know as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth But more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing And that's the big thing I think that they try to promote Yeah that's a good idea Yeah there definitely has to be a motivation factor and I know that where I work I work for a defense contractor And there's a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh Styrofoam usage because of uh the process involved in Styrofoam and the whole eco issue and that and they're very proactive and uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh china wear rather than uh Styrofoam stuff So it's incentives like that that get people more conscious of it I think that's what they need to do Be more proactive like that Yeah they just matter of fact that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa- the local schools you could send your phone book uh with your kid to school and what they'll do is they'll recycle it Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh uh the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time A guy went to a landfill dug down five feet and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty because they don't degrade over such a period of time Yeah Yeah Yeah Okay
