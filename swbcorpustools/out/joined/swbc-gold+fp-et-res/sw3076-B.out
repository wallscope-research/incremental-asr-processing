Most assuredly Yes ma'am I've voted in every major election since I turned twenty-one Don't always vote for somebody I sometimes vote against somebody I think that a lot of it is uh I know that my late husband was simply indifferent He didn't feel like he had any say There was too many people too many other votes For example you know he'd say Well look you and I see different sides of the fence If I go vote you'll cancel my vote I said I sure will He said So I just won't vote I said Then mine counts because you could cancel mine too Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Well characteristically in the local elections typically those people who vote are those who feel very strongly about an issue If I do not feel very strongly about an issue then I see no reason to go vote Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well of course listening to the instructors you'll find out that everything matters but then you could go crazy worrying about everything Well that's the way you get to national and that's the way you make changes about your neighborhood Uh I know that I have been involved in preparing and in uh carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place Even something so simple as getting a street light in between lights on the end of the block But it makes a big difference when it's the difference in having a child run over in the dark And uh it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take that kind of action and that's completely unnecessary In another particular case they were trying to put in a um senior citizen's home in an area very near our neighborhood but if you just cross that major street the character of the neighborhood changes and it's less savory Okay And I felt very strongly about that those people simply did not have access to safety to security and they were at risk And it was for elderly people who lived alone and they were going to put a cluster of houses there for them But even clustering together for the elderly does not ensure safety And all it did was to in my judgment make them easier targets Uh-huh yeah easier targets and so we did get a petition together and we very strongly resisted it and actually it was placed closer to my neighborhood but it was on the right side of the street And uh I think that they're much more comfortable there Uh I haven't seen too much crime in my neighborhood although we have a good crime watch program but it's very serious just across the street Well Well No I don't think it had to do to with woman running against man I think it had to do with dirt running against dirtier And that's it it was a dirty election People were calling each other uh names and every bit of the trash it was a dirty campaign It was a dirty mud slinging campaign Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well of course now that's not all the time We were having some pretty healthy uh campaigns that were based on issues there for two or three of the gubernatorial races but historically Texas has had mud and muddier campaigns I think that eventually you know the better people have sensibilities and they vote on those people who are least likely to do damage Unfortunately that's not always the way it should be You don't want to vote for the person who is least likely to do damage You want to do the one who can do the most good And uh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Okay So you see that's very negative motivation isn't it isn't that too bad We really could use a little positive motivation hey we think this guy can really make some changes and we're going to support him That was true in a lot of cases in a couple of the older sixties campaigns Uh No I'm talking about national campaigns Yeah Uh even when John Kennedy was elected there were so many strikes against him but there were people who believed he could make a difference Now that's not to say what has transpired or what really was I'm saying that's how it was perceived And uh Oh yeah Absolutely and it was people going to vote for I think more than those who voted against I know that in my own uh area of people whom I knew and how they were going to vote they didn't go to vote against uh a politician as they did a little bit later when Nixon was running They went to vote against the lesser of the two evils in certain cases But I think that one was one that you had some very strong feelings among people and they voted their convictions Absolutely You're right
