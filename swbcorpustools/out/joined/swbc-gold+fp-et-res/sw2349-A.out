All right Uh-huh Yes all young Americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means Yeah Yeah Yeah you're probably right two years might be a little too long That's right that would be the problem Sure would Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah or maybe offer them you know some sort of an incentive to do it Uh you know college credit you know something you know I'm not sure what but I'm not sure they need to be you know paid you know a super do salary of any kind but that kind of takes away from public service But just you know to receive a letter in the mail that says you know you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday you know I'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea I'm not either really That's right That's right Uh-huh That's right Absolutely They need young families whatever they just couldn't you know take off to do that Oh That's right uh-huh Uh-huh it sure would It would have to be a lot of you know thought given to something like that I would think Uh-huh Yeah Yeah That's right I'm not even really sure at this point in time you know what programs are out there Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah like maybe if there was something they could do in their own town or city yeah and not have to pull up roots and you know go somewhere half way around the world or something That's right Yeah that's true too That's true too Yeah yeah Me neither And you wonder you know what kind of quality job would they do you know Just sit around for their year or would they really you know make a contribution of some kind Yeah it's tough It's tough Yeah Yeah I'm not sure either But I think there would have to be a lot more you know information you know disseminated before you say let's do this you know Yeah Yeah Yeah That's right Yeah Uh-huh Right That's right Yeah That's a real waste too It really is I don't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps like you know we saw back I guess in the Carter administration that was a big thing with him And as a matter of fact I guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was you know really interested in things like that I just don't hear much about it anymore Like I say I don't even know what programs are even ongoing now you know Anyway it's a tough question Okay well thanks for your time I enjoyed talking to you Okay take care Bye-bye
