Well thanks for being home uh on the weekend uh I'm actually working at night and uh there very few people that are on the list for calls uh on the weekends nights are you part of the school system out there Uh the reason I said that because I've had about uh three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of North Carolina I guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever Oh is that ri- great great Oh is that right That's wonderful Oh yeah I talked to one we're not on the subject Of course I talked to one I think he had a whole bunch of calls He had a roommate that had calls and everything He had way more twice as many calls as as I've made uh and I'm of course we at T I just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will uh sell like gang busters really Okay you first on the subject what do you think about Latin America Latin America yeah Oh really T I had a place I'm not too sure I don't think they do anymore down I think it was Campinas I'm not sure and uh I guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever And they had quite a few uh locations not quite a few several in Latin America I think the one in New Mexico is closed and I think the one in Brazil is closed but I don't know why that is a problem down there and I guess the crime rate is terrible up here too and uh an some people say go to New York but I don't have an answer to the crime rate It's sad That is a sad situation I'd like to go down to Mexico you know and I keep hearing that you know the government and the crime rates pretty high too that is sad Uh not that we can uh sell any great program we have with crime but uh I think uh I'm kind of like you I don't have any strong opinions on it I guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our neighbors down there is that we don't have any We have more I guess ties we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything and we don't really aren't that close to everyone in South America I don't really know why though Right Right Yeah I know that I saw in a book I was reading a Spanish book uh not that I read Spanish you know I just you know reading some Spanish words and there was a comment in there about the Mexicans don't really want us to say we're Americans They would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too you know and I guess that's true We don't think of any one else but oursel- I guess we're kind of uh the smart asses in the world I suppose uh or of America anyway We think of ourselves as the only Americans when they're Americans too As Mexicans yes that No no I know Yeah no they were saying that of us that we're the North Americans and they're Americans they we always say we're Americans and they want us to say we're the North Americans We're not Americans we're North Americans and they're South Americans yeah Whatever I don't want to make I read it somewhere though it's not my point I guess so No no they were lucky enough to have some oil ten years ago and they blew all that and borrowed more money than they can pay back now uh uh so they're not exactly business men I do think we should deal more with them I do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas uh for the language you know is very foolish I'm relatively familiar with Texas school system and we should teach Spanish at least in uh grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish I think that helps when you certainly can speak their language uh and there are problems with you know the wet back problem you know for everyone knows what we're talking about whe- say wet back problem And then we should somehow uh and I think the governments are working on that to try to have some uh businesses uh at the borders of both sides so that you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here to get the jobs you know there there may be some organized way to do this I do feel for them uh they are very envious of us or they wouldn't be coming up here you know risking a lot Not that they're risking their lives of course but risking a lot uh getting thrown back I guess is all that uh happens You probably don't see that Where we see it you know once a month I'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that Okay well you saw it out there then too Uh-huh Yeah I think a common factor to a lot of problems whether it be crime if you want to jump on that is mostly uh poverty Uh and I think a lot of their problems is poverty If we could uh uh the problems we have in this country is a lot of it's poverty Whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty that's another story but uh uh it is sad there's so much down in all of South America uh so much potential you know we're T I of course is really pushing world markets in their products and they're mostly in Europe now and in the Orient Japan and Singapore now just announced building a plant in Singapore uh they're in Taiwan and Japan and they haven't had that much luck in South America and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything And there's got to be trade I guess that's some of the answer I guess is business uh Uh and I try to be an optimist and say well that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to get some business going between each other And we need to do more of that uh somehow And encourage more business between us They've got to have a lot of resources I would think An enormous amount of well potential that way A lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that but uh there's got to be a lot of potential down there what are you taking in school I didn't ask you that What are you taking in school Oh you're an instructor yeah you're an instructor yeah you said That's great Are you teaching Computer Science Wha- you said what were you saying you were teaching there Great great Right of course I work at T I and I'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that isn't enough I'm getting a kick out of the whole program but uh there's going to be I guess thousands I don't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings and I wonder how they're going to analyze them Whether it would be listening to them or analyzing I gu- they've got to be analyzing with a voice recorder some how Uh-huh Right Oh yes I know they change with age I know mine uh has changed uh although you never found your voice echoes in your own head which makes it different than what it really sounds to other people Uh I'm sure singers and professional people know that and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say my God that's obviously that's not me you know But uh I know your voice in your own head resonates a different way Uh go ahead you comment on it yeah I'm glad that you're in the business That I kno- T Is gotten with their Speak and Spell and everything I've told my wife that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer you wouldn't have to have a keyboard you'll be able to just give it commands and I'm sure they have some of that now and not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people
