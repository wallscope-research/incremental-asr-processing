Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure sure Huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh well I guess I'm probably a little more toward the other direction Uh well I guess mainly because uh I well like there's two sides to it I guess Uh one is that uh if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever or you know even if it's smoking inhibits you know your ability to function then I think that you know I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot Uh but I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business Uh and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that uh things like drug laws seem to come and go You know we had prohibition for awhile and then we didn't have prohibition Uh you know we've had I guess laws against uh you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years I guess Maybe a little longer Yeah So eighty years or so Yeah Uh so I you know it's hard I guess for me to justify what seems like you know basically a breach of the you know freedom from uh search and seizure you know uh on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten who knows prohibition certainly didn't last Well but you got to look at prohibition though You had the same problems there right Oh yeah Sure Well it goes back to that again if you look at prohibition because it's illegal it costs more If it was legal face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce And clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap and you know you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it But yeah get uh Oh yeah well that's why there's you know people dealing it because there's money in it you know There's ridiculous amounts of money Oh yeah interdiction's hopeless  there's no way you're ever going to win that The tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up the more incentive there is that's a losing fight Yeah yeah Well yeah It goes back to you know what can society impose on people can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen I don't think you can you know you know was raised with being a very strong Bible work ethic so you know I'm one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people So you know yeah I can really relate to yeah everybody ought to do their own share you know I don't have any you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff But you know
