Okay Uh I really haven't thought about the topic of drug testing But uh just off the top of my head I don't think I see much wrong with it Um if I owned a company and I wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that I had uh coming in uh were trust worthy et cetera and so on I think I would uh probably do the random testing just to insure that my company uh runs safely and smoothly Huh-uh Yeah Yeah That's true I didn't think about that like for instance Uh if someone's working on heavy machinery or say driving trucks or city buses or something like that Then that is something that affects the community You know if you're drinking or on drugs or whatever you're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands Yeah And for me I think that drug testing it follows the path that society is going in If more and more people are using drugs then I think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs it's just where society is right now and you know something we have to cope with and I think the drug testing is something that the drug users have to cope with Yeah Yeah I think that may be That means one of the points of it Of course um I'm not sure you know what the time span is but if I used drugs last week and I had a you know job interview that I wouldn't use drugs the day before or something and they wouldn't even see it You know what I'm saying They may not be able to trace it I don't know how far they trace I don't know what the you know limits are Yeah Um slash error Oh really bh Something like that yeah Um Yeah I don't use any drugs I don't really drink or anything so I'm pretty uh uh I guess decisive about that just the fact that since I don't use drugs I have no problem with taking a test Yeah Yeah Yeah So the only thing I would hate is if I were to go and uh it's kind of the same thing with the lie detector test If you don't have anything to hide you're not going to mind it You know but people that slash error with a47 you know don't have anything to hide And then there are some things that just aren't peoples business that come out at that point so I think that a lot of people have trouble with that I can understand that Huh-uh Huh-uh Yeah Huh-uh Right Right Yeah Yeah I took a lie detector once and I didn't mind it but I was just offended by some of the questions I guess there was one question do you like your mother You know I said yes Do you hate your mother No Have you ever killed your mother And I was going you know What in the world Is that what it was Oh okay Huh-uh Huh-uh Kind of get something to measure my responses by Yeah Yeah Yeah they ask why I was going what in the world are you asking me about here You know slash error But I guess I don't know some people have probably killed their mothers I don't know Yeah Yeah Huh-uh Huh-uh slash error I never thought about that that makes me feel a little better Of course that was years and years ago And  I + slash error I  don't think there are some people because in society a lot of people are taking drugs There is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives But they take a lie detector test or a drug test or whatever and the stuff that happened to them you know five years ago comes up and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better You know when they might be actually trying to improve their lives Huh-uh Huh-uh slash error Huh-uh Yeah Yeah I would probably do that And I would probably bring something in showing that I had been to such and such hospital for help or you know Whatever the twelve month program Or whatever it is that they do Huh-uh Yeah Yeah I'm not sure what they are either Yeah Yeah The other day we had talked about uh capital punishment And I really really hadn't thought about it I think about it because I hear about it but I hadn't had to sit down and well what do I think about it You know and that's kind of like today I'm not real sure what I think about it I'm kind of you know in the middle on that one Huh-uh Really really Okay It was very nice talking to you Okay Take care Bye-bye
