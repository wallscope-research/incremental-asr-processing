Okay Well needless to say here in Washington D C this is the war zone Uh D C around here stands for drug capital or death capital uh it's really bad here Uh for example the uh local high school uh they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns and they're starting to uh get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things So Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh right That's how uh they bind themselves together in groups I guess and uh Now the interestingly enough I don't think we have here a lot of gangs but uh not a whole large group of them but uh just a few Most of them centered around uh drug territory And so they're protecting their economic interests I guess And uh nowadays the latest thing I've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up and then as you get out of the car they just uh step up and uh take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house Yeah that's the uh latest thing That way there's no damage to the car or anything They just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want Uh-huh Right Just wait for you to drive to your house you get out and they get in off they go with your car So it's uh I think they call it car jacking around here Uh-huh yeah that's kind of the latest thing but every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides so uh it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here uh I'm from Ohio and my wife's from Florida so And we've just come from twenty years in the military uh which is an entirely different environment so this is a whole new thing for us to have to put up with and it's uh really scary sometimes Right And it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school and uh of course the mayor uh of D C is having a real problem uh trying to what do you do to reduce crime in a major city like D C where it's a way of life for everybody uh I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem I don't know what the solution is Uh there's no way they can stop the drugs and that's what's causing all the killing <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right And they see all their friends and neighbors uh Yeah and their friends are driving Mercedes and so it's actually they grow up with that as their way of life and uh I think uh to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised Right exactly so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes and they say well it's the law that's uh got to be changed instead of their way of life so I don't know it's I'm glad it's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it's not easy Uh-huh Right They've always been with us Uh-huh Uh-huh Right
