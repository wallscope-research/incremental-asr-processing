Okay um I guess um this is probably really a good subject for me because I really like to do uh hand work Uh mostly I do needlepoint I guess But um Um well I've made a lot of baby gifts It seem like that's like especially lately there's been so many babies uh bibs and blankets and things like that Wall hangings um Isn't that funny No Yeah isn't that funny I guess I do have one thing A friend of mine gave me a clock kit and I needlepointed the face and I uh kept that because she gave me that So Oh yeah And it's real neat Um basically the whole well no I guess the minute marks but the minute marks are done they're like hearts And then the at the numbers they're kind of outlined and stuff it was quite bit of work but you know it was a lot of fun too I really like doing stuff like that So Oh what's that Huh Wow that's interesting what kind of things did you do Oh Yeah What did you call that Huh That's I've never heard of that before I've probably seen it though when you described it Yeah when you described it it sounded like something you know that would be around I guess But I've never heard of it before and it's really interesting Um I guess I've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past but I've kind of gotten out of that I use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows Really Yeah it is Oh basically bows and lace uh ribbons Um I really wanted to do you know so many of them now have the ribbons where I'm not sure how they do it but the ribbons they make them they like I don't know how to explain it They make them hard you know Yeah I've never done that and those are so neat I would really like to do those but Um Oh definitely yeah Oh Oh Yeah I think that's what my concern was was it really sure and how they would last You're right No that's true That's funny Yeah I know That's funny No I do some I have really gotten out of it I don't do it quite as much as I used to Um I guess because I went back to school so I don't have as much time No and I have two children also It keeps me very busy But I really enjoy it when I do do it when I get the chance you know It's really it's so relaxing to just sit but once I get started I can't put it down I just Uh-huh Uh-huh I know I started a project it's been over a year ago that I swore I was going to finish for somebody for Christmas That's what I keep telling this person well I didn't tell you what year <> Um well it's uh cross stitch and it's a picture and it's a wildlife it has deer and trees and it's really beautiful but it's going to be a lot of work and you know I have worked on it quite a bit but not as much as I'd like to You know it's just so hard Uh-huh Well I should- it's counted cross stitch actually is what I'm doing and so since it's counted you know it's really a lot of work Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yep No it really isn't and I tell you really I could just kick myself for even starting it because I have a feeling I'm never going to get it done I'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life No that's true I just don't know when I'm ever it just seems like there's just never enough time to pick it up and do it you know it's just really hard But I really do en- like I said I really enjoy it when I do It's just hard Uh-huh And there's so many other things that I have done you know in the meantime like I said so many baby gifts I've made a lot of bibs and wall hangings and so you know those don't take much time at all So it's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them No I usually just buy a pattern book I have several pattern books and I just go with those And then I buy the bibs separate Usually I think it's a little bit cheaper in the long run and then I just use whatever colors I want to I don't usually use the colors they tell me to And it depends on what it is you know But some things especially letters if they suggest certain colors for letters I just go with whatever I want to Yeah yeah yeah there's a few designs I guess I've done myself but not very many Real simple ones you know I do I made a uh little thumb print and made it a bunny It was really easy just did a thumb print You know Uh-huh And then see I didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print you know that was just the ink and then I made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth That was so simple It didn't take anything at all Uh-huh And then I just
