Uh-huh Well my parents are both in their seventies my mother and stepfather and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies And my uh uh father and stepmother are not in very good health So this is something that is Yes it is Yes they are They are Not for them my mother and stepfather have uh set up an arrangement where they have a large home and uh two of my sisters and their families one of them's husband and then all the children are living in this home Its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms and uh they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen and uh uh my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home Well I felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also uh I read a lot and then I know people then have visited nursing homes and uh have had great grandparents in the nursing homes and it was not a happy situation for any of them and uh we have a very active nursing home here in Plano that has uh activities going all the time and they have uh even the people that are wheelchair bound and really are incapacitated Go and uh participate in olympics and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here You know so there are a lot of activities going on all the time and this is a nursing home it's not a senior citizens home So that the people are really uh Right They need the nursing care but it's a very expensive solution Right Right Right Uh-huh Right And that's right well I took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation and uh they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had uh apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating And uh he apparently had not been in the home too long just a week or so but when the family came in to see him they had not been made aware I was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance and I overheard their conversation And when the family walked in his wife and daughter and son-in-law they were not even aware of what had happened So I told them he strangled on some chicken and uh the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or so you know and I thought Right Right And then she was upset he had on two different shoes one of which was not even his He had on a pair of slacks and the wife said "these are not his slacks" and she said "I just took two pair over yesterday for him that were clean" And Right Right Well this was just something that I witnessed to and uh at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in And we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour And with just a curtain of course between us and uh they revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth and he was definitely just by looking at him and the way he acted you could tell he was in need of nursing home care but the family were all talking about uh putting him in another home They said he will not go back to that one I'm glad they the option I would hate to be in a position where that was all I could afford and there was no choice Oh my Um Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right That's right Visits everyday Right Visit right Right Suspicious {D You know I remember my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died and I guess there was not a name for what she had at that time but I guess Alzheimer's would come as close as anything she really was not aware of what she was doing And uh I can remember she had several strokes and the nursing home was right next to a hospital and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days And it was just like keeping something
