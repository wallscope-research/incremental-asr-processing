Hello Well I think our tastes are fairly similar although I am I government worker I do tend to I'm uh a scientist So that technically I suppose I could get away with extremely casual clothes but for the most part I don't I wear fairly respectable looking shoes and a pantsuit of one sort or another and uh I guess dress it up with a very nice black jacket when I have visitors or have to give talks Right No actually I guess this summer I wore some fairly nice jeans uh more than I have in previous seasons But uh no I tend to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer I don't know whether they think by you know freezing them up overnight then they can save electricity during the day or something but you know you wear a heavy sweater in your office all summer So right uh yeah you know I'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends And I guess although in as I recall the stereotype of secretaries was you know overdress over kill sort of and in a sense the people I know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries Although the fact that most of the ones I know are in the government and they're not meeting the public I find it a little bit strange that their priorities would be to spend this money here You know I suppose if you were more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Exactly you can look businesslike in a the same pant suit you would you know wear for other things Yeah I'm really glad about that pant suits are popular because I'm allergic to many of the synthetics And so I used to have a problem when I was working in a restaurant while I was in college and had to dress up and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash So Right right But otherwise now I guess we're both pretty practical Okay Well have a good day Bye-bye
