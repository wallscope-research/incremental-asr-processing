Well what would you have at a dinner party Uh-huh Oh gosh that sounds great Uh-huh Well um I think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party But if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish Because crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish but you know I wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my guest But if it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like uh shrimp fettucini is real easy to um make and everything and it's usually well liked by people I guess I'm just a seafood fan so I think on the lines of Oh yeah um you're not supposed to eat them dead well you eat them dead but Right Because if they are dead for too long you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out And you're not supposed to eat those because they're bad for you Yeah so if you ever go in a restaurant order crawfish every once in a while you'll see on- it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident but if the tail is straight on it then yeah don't eat it But um you just put some Cajun well lots of pepper and you just boil them and they're absolutely wonderful but uh they're a pain to peel for some people Once you get used to it they're real easy but um you know if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot I think for a dinner party I don't know it depends Like like my age if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party no they would shell their own you know we'd just have crawfish and beer or something but um if it was more formal like if I was you know working environment then I would probably um shell 'em or at least disconnect them from the head But There's a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head So um it would just depend That's the best part of the crawfish Sucking the head But um I don't know it just depends on what type it was I guess But you can buy uh the crawfish shells already peeled 'n everything And usually you use those like for frying or to put in salads or to um You know make a sauce with or something like that But you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled and they're more expensive of course but Um Yeah it really does  Looks like a slash unit to me  I like shrimp better These seems to be independent of A55 utt 2 above not a continuation  Just um The crawfish it just has a taste of its own It also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use stuff like that but um I think that And also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps That's what I need Uh-huh Oh I bet that got pretty competitive you know as far as who could come up with the best recipe That would be fun Uh huh Sometimes it might be the candlelight and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something Well you know that's fun Uh huh That sounds right I'd take him up on that Uh huh I'd be that's about how much I can cook You know I'm doing a lot more cooking now than I used to but that's only because my mom just started working so she's tired when she comes home in the afternoon so I try to have things cooked for her but uh um I usually try to stay out of kitchen I don't know not one of my favorite hobbies Well um my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she owned every Christmas and Easter whenever we have the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce and it has I don't know they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs and they are absolutely delicious I don't know what she calls them in I'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol But um I don't know I would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around Oh Yeah Oh that would be wonderful Yeah Um-hum Oh Um-hum Well um how long do you cook the meatballs Uh huh Oh yeah Hum That sounds great Especially the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so far in advance like if you are having a dinner party on Wednesday night you could do it on a weekend That would be great I think I'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because I hope to have lots of dinner parties Cause I like to um Um I'm sure that I'll be involved in a big company and I know that my future husband will be You know He's going to be working for Chevron in Houston so he's going to be Um You know I'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy Oh yeah I have to impress the boss and clients cause Um I'm in public relations in school so You know my whole job's going to be based on my clients 'n stuff like that so I'm going to have lots of dinner parties And have to take 'em out to eat Right now I'm taking a class on ettiquesy Did she really say "ettiquesy"  and all the little bitty things that I didn't even know I thought for sure I'd been raised properly but I've been doing a lot of things wrong I didn't know about um So Is there anything else Oh yes you need to try em Oh they're wonderful
