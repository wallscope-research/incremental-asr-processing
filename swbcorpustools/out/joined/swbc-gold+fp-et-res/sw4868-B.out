Well actually uh I've had a couple of different situations My current one has been the most successful Uh at a certain point in life an- my ex-husband was an alcoholic And we got divorced back in the mid-seventies and that left me with three teenagers It certainly is But at any rate what happened was that I just absolutely put away all the credit cards I didn't rip them up I didn't send them back Nothing I just put them away Because there was one that it was really handy to have If I absolutely had to have something I could go use it But uh mostly we just spent cash Whatever we had And if we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend it But then as things improved you know once I got them all through college uh it came to the point where uh my parents came through the depression I'm not sure how old you are But my Late thirties yeah Uh-huh And uh my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house And that's kind of the way I was raised And so I'm not a very demanding person in that aspect So for quite a period of time I just flat didn't spend any money Now meanwhile I had a building bank balance And my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have I would have the cash to buy it right then and there And not ever have to spend any money on interest And that's the way I've operated ever since then It and you know if something goes on sale and I don't have the money I still don't buy it Oh my Oh my Oh my Uh-huh And that's the way I do my credit cards now Yeah I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards But it's the fact that I have enough of a cushion in the bank so that when they come I can pay them in full Oh my I'm envious Well I Uh-huh It's time for you to do these things then Right This is so funny That's wonderful But you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend it certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should be or not
