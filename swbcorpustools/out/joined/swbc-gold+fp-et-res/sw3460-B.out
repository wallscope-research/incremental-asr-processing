Uh I was just now told that's what the topic was and uh I guess invasion of privacy uh to me for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards for example And uh I guess recently one of the T V stations here uh ran a series of uh news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers And use it and I was quite surprised at that I guess I can consider myself fortunate that uh it never happened to me I don't know what I'd really do if it did Uh No not really because I'm listed in the phone book If I was the type of individual that uh had an unlisted number I think I would be hesitant to give it One of the things that upset me when I lived in California was uh they did a lot of things with your Social Security number As a matter of fact they even went to the point of printing our Social Security number on your driver's license And they would not cash checks unless they had your Social Security number so we had our Social Security numbers imprinted on our checks And I was really you know unhappy about that situation I think that was an invasion of privacy Right One of the biggest things I think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of uh mail lists and things like that You know uh recently uh I purchased some magazines U S NEWS and FORBES magazine And every since that day I have been inundated with you know uh subscriptions to this subscriptions to that uh this news letter this investment letter uh even to the point of people calling me at home And prior to me ordering these magazines I never got those kind of calls And Uh-huh From some list yeah Uh-huh Right All their time Sure I think the general public would be you know uh tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for uh let's say the criminal individuals to get access to people's records uh their credit cards driver's licenses checks things like that Uh I don't think anybody really knows what to do about it Computers caused a lot of this I'm sure Sure Seems as though they are yeah Unfortunately Fortunately I uh haven't uh been inundated with that situation yet
