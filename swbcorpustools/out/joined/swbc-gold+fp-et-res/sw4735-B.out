Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Um Well that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to uh mandatory Yeah A yeah I kind of agree with that Uh I don't think you know they should have the same rights as anyone else you know uh anything shouldn't be mandatory other than I guess like uh when you come to paying taxes or something like that Uh or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe uh people be more eager <> to do it Yeah Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh that's a good idea Uh I think they should have more programs like that And I think uh us being taxpayers we pay for uh people that's in jail or in trouble anyway So they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas And I agree wholeheartedly Yeah But uh the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff going on uh because like you say is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors so why have someone in jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor And sometimes you know putting them in jail doesn't really help because there's nothing in there that would <> rehabilitate them and then when they get out they because they have this stigmatism of being in jail Uh-huh Uh-huh Right
