I think that would probably uh be very possible and we really wouldn't feel it in our services Yes I have Right Right Right Yeah Well I one thing that really bothers me beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes and the um regular normal taxpayers are you know paying such a large proportion of our personal income and then the uh corporate you know industries just don't seem to not pay proportionally I think that that would help a lot I guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things but I don't know It's just hard to take and you know see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use And uh seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from that direction But Yeah Yeah not going to help It's never helped my personal situation I can't say it would help with theirs either Amen It seems to be you know I it really does bother me when I think about you know leaving our children with this sort of uh a national problem that we can't seem to find an answer to it uh I don't know Right Yeah Well that's quite possible I guess we have to keep plugging away a little bit or it will just totally get even more out of control but I don't know Yeah I do She's a we're not feeling too well over here so that Yeah No no She's I don't think I could part with her Okay Okay well thanks Bye-bye
