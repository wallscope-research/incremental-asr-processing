Okay Yeah yeah Well first of all I have to ask you how old you are Twenty-seven okay Well I am quite a bit older than you are But no I think exercise is extremely important and I do exercise on a regular basis Well I do uh jazzercise which is an aerobic uh program that are you familiar with it It's uh you know a national company and we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes like all day long so you can No it's an aerobic routine you warm up and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate and then you gradually go down again No I only do it probably two or three times a week The minimum they want you to do is three times a week Well it's really a it's called a center and you buy as many classes as you want to at a time and then you just go in whenever you can So like I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings No I go by myself and that's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise or they might play tennis and since I am not a tennis player uh you know I don't get that but I am in my late forties so uh there aren't many people you know that want to do that Most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers You know with children between the ages Young mothers You know young women with small children are the ones that I find Well what do you do Oh great Yeah Do you play every day Well now who do you play with Do you have friends that play with you or just Yeah Well see that's really good and I think that keeps some people from exercising I don't have a problem with weight either but I think I don't have a problem because I exercise You know people are always saying to me how do you stay thin and it's because I exercise but I also watch what I eat You know but you'll come being twenty-seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet but as you get older you will Well it might not Mine because everybody's been telling me that too and so far it hasn't happened you know and I just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high Yeah But you don't play any other sports but basketball But do you ski Being in Utah I was wondering if you ski Oh did it really Cause I know that skiing in Utah is suppose to be great Yeah Yeah Well I have never skied before but I have friends that go to Utah all the time and they think it's really and they ski I guess there's a place where you can ski well is it Tahoe Where you ski from no that's Nevada to California I guess Yeah I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line But there is a place in Utah called a funny name But it's like Oh Heavenly Is that it Yeah I think it's called Heavenly You've never heard of that Well maybe it isn't in Utah But they said they've skied Heavenly and it sounded like you know that they skied really well when they are actually talking about a place It's kind of funny Oh yeah You can get really sore I know you I've talked to people but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore And then is it your quadriceps that are the worst In your legs and Yeah Yeah Well and it's strange that you can do like I did aerobics you know all the time and then I went horseback riding and still I was so sore and I couldn't get over
