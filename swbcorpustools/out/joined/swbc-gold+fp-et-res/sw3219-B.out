I'm already on my job so you reached me at my job my dress for work uh most of the time is uh rather comfortable and casual uh usually uh slacks and a soft colored shirt The um thing that distinguishes me a lot of the time when I have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is I wear a clerical collar and a suit and uh all of that sort of thing but when I don't need to dress up for a meeting or a service of some sort I don't Yes Well around there you can probably wear uh T-shirts and other things but around here at this time of the year we are into sweaters and uh coats today we wear coats and as the day uh warms up we may go to light jackets but I don't think there's an escape from light jackets The wind will take away a lot of body heat Very similar No I'm not stuck with that kind of a uh situation As I say unless it happens to be now yesterday I had to dress up and uh be more formal because I had a formal meeting at noon time but then I can go home later in the day and be a little more casual and then if I have a meeting of people that I know I can be very casual in the evening Yeah around here in a lot of places that's the way it is there are expected uh dress codes  and the people need to follow that I think uh years ago I used to be far more uh committed to the idea of a dress code but I've relaxed a lot more as I've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself It's taken a long time to break away from that but now that I've broken away from it I'm glad I have You mean you don't need to wear little old house dresses any more That's a good idea that's a good idea No there you know Yeah what kind of shoes do they wear down there Uh-huh we can wear pretty much that although um tennis shoes are kind of out in almost every every situation unless you want to look like a gook <> A lot different You too and thank you for calling Uh-huh Bye
