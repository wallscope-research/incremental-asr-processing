Yes it's a house we bought uh about two and a half years ago now Uh-huh First house Uh-huh Uh-huh So what do you think of owning a home as opposed to renting somebody else's Uh-huh Uh-huh is it a fairly large house Oh that's pretty good size Yeah Uh-huh It's tiny It's not much bigger Actually we had an two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is So Yeah uh it's only like eleven hundred square feet Just one Yeah But uh all the rooms are small but it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted And uh Use an extra one for an office which is handy I'd rather have more rooms and less space in each one I guess Rather have lots of rooms and lots of space but uh that ends up costing me Well it's a very very middle class neighborhood Uh lots of young couples with you know usu- oh I'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood that's their first homes and uh lots of kids and stuff and so it fits well in the neighborhood it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood but on the other hand it's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than I want is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood or is it Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh wow eight kids Oh my gosh Ooh I'm sure with eight gosh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah new ones they tend to be real tiny uh especially in newer neighborhoods my brother just built a new house He lives in Wichita Kansas and um the neighborhood actually fought him on it because um the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood Now that's because he's doing a lot of it himself you know for example landscaping and lots of the other stuff and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots in the neighborhood but they were pretty touchy on it He was a little surprised Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Kind of depends on when they get in you know Oh they have it's gotten yeah Yeah oh Uh-huh Um Well see my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they moved into a neighborhood and bought a real nice stone house down in South Austin uh and what the builder apparently plans to do is they do phase one and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled uh codes and stuff and then they come back in and then they sell
