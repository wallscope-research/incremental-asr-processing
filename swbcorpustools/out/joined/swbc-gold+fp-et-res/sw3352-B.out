Yes sir I'm right here Well actually I've done both kinds uh I'm originally from the State of Virginia and uh lived near Virginia Beach where we could uh surf cast and uh catch a lot of things in the ocean there I don't believe I have fished the James River There's a possibility but that was so long ago I moved here to State College uh in nineteen fifty-five and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water and we have a lot of uh beautiful fresh water streams that come through this area I'm in an area called Center County which is in the very center of the State of Pennsylvania The trout fishing is really uh beautiful As I say the streams are oh eight ten fifteen feet wide and so forth and uh you stand on the edge and you cast out and you work uh from your feet most of the time and then there are a few lakes of course close by should this be part of utt1 and the end of a slash unit Well tell you the truth I'm uh not picky I wherever the area whatever fish is the specialist in that area uh I enjoy fishing for it and I try to I haven't fished in several years I'll have to admit but when I do fish I do contact uh some of the local specialists so that I can then find out uh the type of lures that they use and where they fish and any unique uh techniques that would help you Uh no we fly fish Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh that's a pretty big fish Uh-huh Well our streams here are replanted with fish about every year so that well uh they have a pretty good idea of uh what the number of fish are in these various locations and they have certain areas that they plant you know a hundred here and a hundred there and this is of course X number of weeks or months before fishing season opens so That sounds about right uh-huh pretty close You know Well as I say it's been several years but the licenses weren't that expensive I seems to stick in my mind five to seven dollars is about all from what I remember it Uh-huh And I have oh probably a half a dozen different kinds of uh fishing poles and fly rods and so forth and I had been so busy in my work in these last few years that I haven't had time to fish But I'm going to be retiring at the end of December and I hope uh the next fishing season that I can sort of get back in and uh enjoy that that was a really enjoyable uh thing for me to do Huh I just have one son and he lives out of the state now rather in the eastern corner of it so I don't think he has time to fish either Oh is that right Oh my goodness Well the disease I caught was simply because uh I was in the Norfolk Portsmouth area and people there there's so much water around that you're either boating or you're fishing and uh I fairly enjoyed at that time I have a small aluminum boat here that uh when I go on one of the large lakes that we have here I enjoy fishing for trout from that Well as I say I'm in Center County um there're two different size lakes about well five six miles from State College Now these aren't huge lakes from your point of view but they are probably fifteen twenty acres maybe which here is a lot of water
