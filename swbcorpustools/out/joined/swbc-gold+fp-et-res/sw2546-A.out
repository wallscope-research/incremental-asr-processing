I guess don't really have a problem with capital punishment I'm not really sure what the exact uh specifications are for Texas I know that they uh have capital punishment for certain crimes and that's probably the way I feel about it is uh it kind of depends on the crime that's committed My belief all my life I guess has been that if you take someone else's life then you automatically are giving up uh yours in place of it But I don't seems to be a lot of controversy about that That's true I guess well there's probably two or three different types of views as far as the controversy goes I can see where if a life was taken by accident or uh I don't know what you'd call it not premeditated or I guess primarily by accident uh there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for but I lean towards if it's premeditated or if it's uh kind of a habitual or uh a tendency that people uh may get into then I guess I don't really have a problem with it Yeah Yeah I think that's what aggravates a lot of people is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months No Right No it's not You think of your chances of getting the death penalty after uh committing a crime are really pretty slim right now And you can probably spend uh a lot of time uh or maybe eventually uh just waiting it out and that's where a lot of aggravation comes I think is uh these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process they may spend years and you know the last I heard it was costing ten twenty thirty thousand dollars a year uh to keep these guys waiting Yeah yeah to carry it out It sort of takes the justice out of the justice system Yeah It should be over and done with Yeah it is And she winds up being a victim day after day after day Right She's an emotional victim And you know like you say the cops that are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work basically go out the window Yes they are Well that's about five minutes so unless you've got something else well It's a pleasure talking with you Okeydoke good-bye
