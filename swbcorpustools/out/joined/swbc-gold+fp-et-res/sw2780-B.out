Uh-huh Well now you say two different parts of the country are you referring to yourself or Uh-huh Uh well of course you talk gun controls down here in Texas and you're asking to be lynched Uh-huh Well it's very true now I'm a uh New Yorker by birth Although I claim Florida as my home now uh I have two sons living down there but I also have two sons living elsewhere one in Tennessee one in Mississippi But I lived in Florida for ten years and I kind of like it down there but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far I think uh well in your words they were a little bit too liberal if I'm correct I believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons But they uh quickly did away with it I think in the next session they uh modified it but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh Florida the delay Uh huh Well I don't mind that too much I'm with the N R A myself And uh uh Really the only objection we have Is uh you give a little and next thing you know somebody's trying to take more Yeah Well then tell me do you consider yourself a liberal Well let me ask you this then what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag Huh Well now wait a minute there you just said it It's their right by freedom of speech What does speech have to do with burning a flag Now uh Well I still go back to Then would you condone the burning of the capitol building Uh then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh a public uh symbol Uh yeah but here again I go back to the second amendment You can disagree by freedom of speech which has nothing to do with action Now I am adamantly against that Uh-huh huh Yeah Uh-huh No Uh-huh Well here again we uh even though you agree with me you wouldn't do it yourself Nevertheless you maintain that it is the right of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country Uh um so long as it's their possession Ok that's fine up to there except that uh what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country and I used to know as a Boy Scout but all I remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country and to maintain it And to me that's uh uh black eye to every man that ever uh carried a weapon or killed for his country Uh-huh It's very easy to do Uh Uh-huh Well I think it should be permitted under certain circumstances Uh-huh Huh Well tell me has it ever been decided when is a uh fetus a human Huh Or they within the own uh society it can vary Uh-huh
