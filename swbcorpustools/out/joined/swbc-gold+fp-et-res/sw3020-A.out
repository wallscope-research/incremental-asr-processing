So where was your last vacation Oh well actually I did visit Hawaii once but I never made it off of Oahu which I've heard is not the nicest of the islands Uh-huh Oh that's wow Yeah Oh I've been lots of places My last vacation was actually in Morocco I guess that one would count Uh that was about a year and a half ago and Uh well my husband is French and we were living in France at the time and we decided that I've never been to Africa and I needed to get that continent since I hadn't been there yet And actually it's a fairly common vacation place for French people to go and they speak French so uh you know in that sense is just a little bit easier and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go So we didn't really have enough time We had about a little bit less than two weeks And as always it seems a bit uh rushed We do a lot of traveling around We rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere No in fact some of the days we froze It was well we were there in the winter In uh January or February I don't remember which Uh-huh Uh-huh at what age did you Oh that's too bad because Uh-huh Yeah It was a very interesting vacation The only thing I didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh um it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide and there were some places where people defini- there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and you know in jacket underneath a coat type of thing But Uh-huh Yeah the worst place was in Marrakech and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad and a couple of them it was what we did in some of the other cities and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide it doesn't matter who it is and they keep everyone else away from you And it's worth it and it's like ten dollars a day or something and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you and you feel stupid doing that but we did it and we were much happier and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone uh Uh Yes No actually I haven't been all through Europe like I haven't been to Italy yet Uh we're going to go for a conference in September and so hopefully we'll get to travel a little bit too Uh my more exciting spots have been I've been to the Galapagos Islands Uh-huh that was one of the most wonderful vacations I've ever had Yes If you like wildlife it's a fabulous vacation If you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest But that was really really fabulous and just the photos I have of it and gosh incredible and be so close Um August eighty-eight And then actually after there I went to um Hawaii a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings and so I went to Hawaii and then to Australia and Japan and China actually I didn't go diving I'm a diver and so that's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips but uh no I didn't get to the Great Barrier Reef I drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to Adelaide It's gorgeous absolutely gorgeous The coastline was just incredible It's huge Australia Yeah Uh but I don't remember if I had shrimp I don't think so Oh I like that too But uh in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car it would have been I think much more fun to do it like in the van with a bunch of people But uh Uh-huh And I was by myself in China too Yeah China was a little bit more uh of a challenge But it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time and so I never you know got out by myself or not much No actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit no maybe it was about a thousand dollars maybe a little bit less I don't really remember for ten days including all my meals a guide a car the airfare but this is from Hong Kong because I was already in Hong Kong um but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and I went to Beijing Shanghai Chengdu and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little Quingdao I think is the name of it It's a little uh sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai It's just a train ride And that I had yeah two internal plane flights and a couple of other things It was really Uh-huh Around a thousand Oh Japan's ridiculous And I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels but I stayed in they were all completely clean and you know they were newly built and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line hotels because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff Right Right Uh but yeah that was I highly recommend that way to go If you're ever interested in going the route I dealt with this woman her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston Yeah Uh and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China and she just gave me this woman's name to contact and it would really be fun I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide and then
