Yeah we have one that's seventeen one that's fifteen and one that's just now six And we had kind of a hard time finding someplace we could put Michael's goods his birthday is the first of September and he was going to school at five So he started the first grade when he was five or started yeah first grade when he was five years old Yeah so we could you know we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something And it was uh mediocre expensive it wasn't really that expensive but it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something Yeah Yeah well Yeah but parents pay when they stay home with them anyway You know my wife works so it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the baby-sitter so <> We try to Yeah see I don't know Yeah Yeah Yeah Well see we took our time and we checked it out and we found a preschool for him And it you know through other folks where I work I work at T I So through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool it was actually at a licensed preschool you know we had those requirements so Yeah I know I'm well that and you know I don't think I would have left him anywhere that would I would have stayed home with him first before I left him somewhere that you know they still have unlicensed baby-sitters running around up here and you know I don't think I'd take that chance You know I think it's out of sight or out of mind for less than for more than a minute or so But you never know Yeah Yeah But you you know as far as child abuse is these days you never know you don't know who you can trust and who you can't you know Yeah senior care is getting real bad <> Yeah So you have no children at all <> Gee Do you miss that part in your life or Yeah Yeah yeah I imagine yeah working in the news production anyway back to the subject we should have discussed this earlier but anyway it's tough it really is it's hard to find good child care and it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's going to be fine all day long And Yeah you know and he's doing real well it has paid off for him He's in first grade now and he's you know got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level So you know those early ages you know when his mom and dad are at work and he's actually in child care in a preschool not just child care you know we could have sent him to anybody you know there's a lot people at work that would have baby-sat him but sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something has paid off not only for us his attitude is I think a little bit tall for a six year old you know but his Um they were outside my marriage so I don't know I would say no but you know all my children excel they're really good and I guess no he learns from the older boys too but Yeah yeah Yeah seeing like uh in one way we're kind of lucky because they're all boys but in another way we're not so lucky because we don't have another woman in the house for my wife to share but you know so we faced that too but he learns quite a bit he learned quite a bit not only from nursery school but he learned quite a bit from the older boys and you know he's excelled and it's paying off for him it really is he is pretty smart sometimes he's a little bit smart mouthed but he is smart <> you know Yeah But I think it's really nice to know that you can find someplace I don't know you know how it is down there in Waco but in Lubbock we have a few that you can send your children to and they can actually learn something instead of just being baby-sat And No not in Huh-uh We just Yeah they're trying to The federal government is trying to intercede on that too so no we don't get Well it would be nice you know there Yeah there's not well You know where we sent Michael the first few years there was different teachers all the time you know some girls were there in the morning and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon and they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day You know and then they had a group of kids and they put on skits and they put on plays and they did the Halloween thing and the Valentine's Day things and you know it was important to us so you know we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way Um No because you know as a child growing up I think is a task that belongs to his parents I don't think he needed to be attached to too even though he did you know he attached himself to a couple of those but I think his attachments at home and you know he gets the idea of what school is for and uh you know I have different teachers here and this person can teach me one thing and this person teach me another and no so I really can't say that it's important for him to attach himself to anybody He did well you with another child I can't say that Because I don't have that experience Yeah see But I don't have that experience so I can't say that you know he did well so I don't think we made too many mistakes We tried hard Yeah he's doing real well And he learned from it and that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be baby-sat all day You know baby-sat sounds to me like well you're here I guess I'll watch you when I get time You know maybe I'll clean my house maybe I'll cook you lunch maybe I won't you know and Yeah yeah Yeah and you know I don't allow that when he's at home but we had a good experience and we really did well and he served better than we did you know he actually gained from it you know sure we gained from it because we were allowed to continue our employment and continue our family but I think in the long run he gained from it just being somewhere where we learned something instead of just sitting around watching T V and playing all day And it's important Yeah Yeah Yeah well Yeah Well you know his Mom didn't go back to work until you know when he was six months old And we just didn't want to dump him somewhere and make him feel like he wasn't wanted And we wanted his center of attention at home but we did what we could and it worked out real well I'm glad we were so careful Oh yeah you know Well it Most of the time now it's a necessity you can't afford so you know I'm not making seventy or eighty thousand dollars a year so it's pretty tough Yeah and Mom was allowed to stay home and you know there was a few families outside of that where dad stayed home and mom worked but not very many that I know of when I was growing up and you know I'm forty now but you know when I was a kid Mom was always at home So we didn't Yeah it is yeah it is I'll agree with that it is it's not there Yeah
