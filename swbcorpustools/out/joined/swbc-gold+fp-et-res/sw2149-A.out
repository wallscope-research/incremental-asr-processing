<> So what do you think uh should young Americans be forced to do a year of service Yeah I think something like the Peace Corps is a bit harsh No kids Vol- Yeah I think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two I'd force them I think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it Right exactly I was a Boy Scout As part of being a Boy Scout you had to do you know projects all throughout and then to become an Eagle Scout you have to do a yearlong project Yeah now I think people generally volunteer That there's no problem with getting them to do stuff Well we have a funny commercial around here It says something like if people were to give five hours a week or five percent of their salary they could solve all the world's problems or something So I guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could uh or just force kids to serve for uh parents I guess Substitute my + yeah my  kid will do four or five hours this week for me No problem Uh-huh I've seen that Yeah they just started trying to get something together like that around here from the community because uh we had a big ice storm uh very recently You don't sound like you're in the north You sound like you're in the south somewhere Yeah uh I'm in uh New York Upstate New York yeah And uh Long way uh And we just had a really big ice storm And basically I'm in Rochester which is uh right upstate Half of the trees in the city uh are no good anymore That's how bad it was Everything is just down everywhere You know we had three hundred thousand people without power You know it was and we didn't have power for a week and there are still people who don't have power Oh yeah it's been ten days already and there are still something like ten thousand people without power and were officially + yeah and we're officially  in a state of emergency Funny thing is the national news how they covered it Uh Yeah I think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something and we've been in a state of emergency you know for ten or eleven days You know We just got our phone back today uh and they're you know putting out ads now for people to come volunteer or to have their organizations come volunteer to help clean up the streets Because we have you know everywhere that a tree is down people need help and a lot of older folks need help getting their yards cleaned out because they can't afford to pay anyone and they certainly can't carry it themselves and So Oh that's great And is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth or Oh so he That's real nice Right that's real good and I bet it gives you a real good feeling to be doing that Yeah uh that's real good uh we had organizations like that in college you know We had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups and some did elderly visits uh some did you know Big Brother Big Sister stuff like that And I'm convinced that at least twenty-five percent of our school participated in some sort of group You know activity like that You know Twenty-five I don't know Twenty-five percent <> Yeah my wife was big in that And she thinks {A yeah } twenty-five percent it was a small school But uh Yeah but a lot of people would get involved you know because there were all different organizations to do There was Big Brother Big Sister they had a yearly auction they had a dance marathon for charity or to support that group Such that you know lots of people got involved that way Yeah Yeah no neither do I I think it should be completely optional and you know Yeah they're not worth a year Or some people just can't even afford it you know whatever the Peace Corps doesn't pay very well You know People get shipped off and then their parents I have a friend whose daughter is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala right now And you know he and his wife just went off to visit her and you know I know I could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala You know so so I think you know and the kid's certainly not making much money So I can see where that may be a problem Just take off a year Yeah I don't Yeah yeah well neither can I so I did my service before and I'll do my little community service throughout but never for a year again so I guess our vote is no Well it's been nice talking to you again Well yeah we're slowly getting everything back together again You know it's taking time but everything you know we got lucky We had no damage to our house or anything so The rest will just have to come with time Well good luck to you too Bye-bye <>
