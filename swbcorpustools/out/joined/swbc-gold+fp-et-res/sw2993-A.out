Are you in the market for a car recently Oh what did you get Uh-huh what convinced you to get that one Uh-huh Oh incredible how many miles on it And it's still running real well Oh great yeah uh right now we have two cars uh I have my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers one of which is um an eighty-eight Plymouth Voyager Van and then we have um about a year ago we picked up a second hand uh uh Audi and uh that was you know a sedan and uh we got that The major things the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova and a well my son was driving and someone came into his lane and hit him and fortunately he was able to his he was out of the hospital by that night but the car was completely totalled and my two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that which was hit by another car So I was getting really nervous so I finally said I want a really solid car So we found the Audi second hand I guess right now my criteria for cars is uh being solid able to take an impact and uh so uh we're not going to be in the market in the near future for any new car But the things that I would want <> would be a solid car Another thing I'd definitely <> want would be anti-lock brakes Uh our van which is a delight to drive does not have I think the brakes on the Plymouth van are terrible If the road is at all wet and I'm and I don't go all that fast but uh it just doesn't hold It doesn't hold well at all So I definitely want to get anti lock brakes So I don't know do you have any particular things that are priorities on your list Yeah I guess down here air conditioning's a must isn't it Uh-huh That's incredible That is incredible Uh  we get about + the van on highways can get about twenty-eight The Audi does not have good mileage That's the one drawback It's a powerful car Um but it does not uh if I'm on a highway and I can get twenty twenty-one miles per gallon I consider that I'm lucky maybe sometimes I've gotten twenty-two It comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving and that's to me is a real drawback I wish you know I could settle for twenty-eight but uh uh the frills on that car are nice but they're not necessary for me except air conditioning uh in Washington D C area it gets hot and humid Yeah uh so air conditioning is uh definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer Um but I don't need uh you know power windows are nice but I don't need them Although I must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads come into a toll road you just push that button down it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up instead of having to crank it Yeah or you know if you want to have open windows to be able to op- if you're alone in the car just to press buttons and But you know I've lived all these years without them I probably could have lived a little longer Uh one of the things that uh we've liked when we gotten a new car and this used car has it is a sun roof and those are really nice in good weather so I guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have anti lock brakes I'd love to get an air bag and a sun roof uh just so it'd be a good solid car I guess that those are my major criteria Everything else is you know a luxury and they make the car more expensive but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong So uh if you were to buy a brand new car what would you look for Yeah yeah Isn't that true it's funny um uh that you use the Audi's German and I have to say it has been pretty dependable Yeah sometimes one advantage of an American made car is if you get stuck anywhere most local garages can fix you up But once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really and I know the Audi parts are terribly expensive it jus- I shudder I would not get the Audi again just for that reason But I would love I wish that you know engineering would make something as solid as a German car You know we certainly have the technology but it's amazing when we bought this Audi everything is more solid in it Uh if you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic and I know and and I'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a solid car I don't think I have to give up as much as I'm giving up But do you need air conditioning down there Yeah Oh we've had eleven days in a row over ninety They've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that Well listen I enjoyed talking with you Okay and enjoy your car Thank you you too it's going to be a hot one Okay bye-bye
