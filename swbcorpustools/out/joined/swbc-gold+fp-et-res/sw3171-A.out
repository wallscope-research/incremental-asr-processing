Where is your favorite place to go Oh that's great Have you ever been there Oh that's a perfect age for Disneyworld Oh that's great Yeah so we've been there a number of times and uh we're going next year We have a business trip every fall Well we go on a lot of business trips I don't work Well we do We g- my husband travels a couple times a month and in the position he's in they don't care if I go along So it's great I just kind of join up when it's something interesting and uh Disneyworld is the one for a week next year and it will be at this time of the year and this year uh uh matter of fact we're leaving next Saturday for New Orleans have you ever been there Well you know we went there once In fact we had been in Dallas and we were on our way home and we were driving and we said let's go to New Orleans So when he said well this year you know I have a week there on a project he's going to be and then I said well I'll going along I hope it's swimming season because it wasn't a tremendous amount of things That I wanted to do there well and that's probably we do like the night life to an extent and they do have a Mardi Gras night planned And I'm kind of anxious for that but uh yours to Disneyworld sounds a little bit better Did you know that next week there's several T V shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary Well and with a daughter nine it is just she's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind Uh so well if you're working then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go Oh that's Well I really I think travel when I heard my topic today I thought okay that's my favorite becau- And really at our point of life our children are grown and uh it has just worked out really well with this uh position he's in Because I can go at a spur of the moment or what have you and it depends where he's going whether or not I decide to go along but I do like to travel and it's uh I don't mind the pool life at all during the day And I like to sight see and I love to shop So it's That's right but it Well and one of my very favorite is Las Vegas Uh that I would have to say we both end up going to Las Vegas uh probably once every maybe year and a half And presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles and so I've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with Continental and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of Continental And I said now that we have all the miles we better start using them Uh So we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip Uh when we normally go that way we like to go to California at the same time because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably from Texas I think that's a good trip And really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent Now we did what we sometimes do since we are in Ohio and it takes a while just to even get to what I would call the more picturesque part of the country we will fly to something like once we flew to Colorado to Denver and then we rented a car for two weeks and we went through the northern route and through Utah and as far west as Las Vegas and then we returned through uh New Mexico that you just mentioned And oh it was just great Oh I think that's the way to
