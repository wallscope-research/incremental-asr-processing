Well how do you feel about the immigration laws Yeah well I'm not real sure why I got this topic because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws Oh Uh-huh Huh No that doesn't make a whole of lot sense Uh-huh Yeah Well uh uh my family is from uh Europe well from England and Ireland and uh have been in this country for oh more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years so I don't have any uh relatives uh several generations back that I am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family they were all born here so I don't have any real strong ties with the immigration laws I don't have any personal feelings about them and I haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are Um Uh-huh Yeah Well I agree with that I think if immigration was entirely unrestricted uh not only would the United States become well more over populated awfully quickly I think it would bring in a lot of uh people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in other countries I think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their brand of crime I was not aware of that Uh-huh Yeah I think so Well I've enjoyed talking to you Okay Thanks Bye
