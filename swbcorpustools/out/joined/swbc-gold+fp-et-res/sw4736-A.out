Capital punishment uh I guess out in California has had uh a lot of you know discourse in the paper Uh apparently you know they haven't uh executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven I believe Yeah they Well we lived in Redwood City when we were out there uh and we found that uh you know it was a very liberal kind of community But uh I really feel that the law enforcement community uh you know puts these people behind bars and then these lawyer groups get together and uh they I think extend beyond the normal uh appeal process Uh you know and just drag this guy uh his uh ultimate uh demise out for ten or fifteen years Uh and I think uh that there's something that has to be changed in the system to do that I think capital punishment uh uh was probably stringent enough but I think the appeal process is really getting in the way do you feel as though there should be uh uh more uh you might say transgressions that would be enforceable uh by uh uh capital punishment Uh-huh Well the term technicality The law enforcement community uh uh you know has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which uh grievous <> acts are done you know to get somebody into a situation where they're going to be guilty of a crime uh and whether the rights of that individual have been you know impuned Uh or whether you know a policeman has just made a noncritical error though be it not the right way to do it but you know the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a law breaker as being supportive Now I'm at this juncture you know I'm not sure you know what constitutes a technicality You know that's what all these hearings are about and that's what all these you know court cases are about our glorious uh you know mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of the can and uh you know he tried to appeal his conviction Uh and you know it didn't work But be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry Uh in the old days you know and say round about times of battle of Hastings you know and the villages if you were a transgressor they either you know drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody and you were his slave And if he didn't like what you did he killed you And that's pretty effective Uh you know it's not good for civil rights I guess but it's pretty effective in that you know you've got to get along in the community and if you don't you'll perish Either by the hand of your master or by being pushed out in the woods So as man has gotten more complicated so all of the uh imaginations to uh you know protect him from being uh dumped on by uh civilian authority in criminal actions especially you know murder cases and that sort of thing Uh-huh
