Um serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it Uh Well that's funny because I just um quit my job to stay home with my kids And um I was a teacher for seven years in the public schools so I know a little bit about it not a whole great deal Well um there's some There's several It's such a broad you know topic that you need to boil it down But um one that um I thought it was a serious problem that I'm not sure it's being taken care of right now uh was like bilingual education for um different um minority groups and like Asians and um uh Mexican Americans and just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and in this area and um as the school district I'm not sure how to go about it because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these languages and so most of these children are put in um either special ed or a bilingual program and then for just a small amount of time and then they're into their regular classrooms the remaining part of the day and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak English And so um a lot of the money isn't put into that and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner and um you know there's only so long you can do that and to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts And a lot of the teachers it was not the teacher's fault A lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children <> Yeah Yeah Yeah Oh yeah Oh definitely definitely and it teaches language too Which is really good Um Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Oh definitely yeah Yeah Right right Yeah Yeah Well I know Richardson school district has a wonderful program in the remedial reading um where you know of course all the children are tested in some time portion of the year and uh some children who need extra help are put into this um reading program and it is just excellent It is I wish that all the children could be exposed to that program you know And I know that there are some parents that say how do I get my kids in that and yet they don't qualify but it's unfortunate that they don't qualify because I think everybody would benefit from these programs It is excellent so I have two little ones and that's why I quit my job Uh you know I've been teaching since they were gosh newborns and it just wasn't adding up and you know being a teacher you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just you know don't have the time It was kind of getting to me where I'm doing the same thing And so um you know my children are getting older and I was missing out on a lot so I just decided to stay home for a while I don't know how long
