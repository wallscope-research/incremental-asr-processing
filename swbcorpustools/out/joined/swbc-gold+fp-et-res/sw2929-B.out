Well I believe that um the voice that uh initialized this call asked about uh if we thought that it should be something that should be put into action Yes I would be committed to that becau- Oh definitely Yes I know that there are many countries that uh are very successful with the operation of the government uh providing that plan Um I'm not sure how their program is run but I know it has been successful And I would really have to uh read the history of uh the country that has fared very well with it and I'd like to see uh the data on that Well I Yes I think that's primary is if you have a good relationship with your doctor that you can feel free to discuss anything with him And uh Oh absolutely that the choice would be yours yes if you felt that you weren't being um given the proper guidelines for your health that you should be able to make um a choice there Yes and the expense of that yes Well I would think that they would have that as part of the benefit to the health care program that you would indeed have a choice that you could select that individual yourself And I'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor and hopefully that they would have their um accreditations there too Yes um but those guidelines have to be set up and I think they should be voted on by the public And uh Uh-huh uh-huh Right yes And of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be and um I think that's primary uh if they were going to have a universal health care plan That uh they would have all the facts and the figures and uh what it would mean to each individual family or an individual perhaps being single Um I'm not sure what else that uh we could address uh on health care uh other than the fact I think uh the eyes and the ears and the uh whole self should be uh uh included in all of that Uh dental eye care and uh our body as a whole should be included in that because there are so many avenues that needs to be um undertaken in a program like that Um I wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for anything and not be covered by the program Uh-huh And does he have an option uh if he doesn't care for the personality Oh I see Well if he's pleased with it I guess that's uh the bottom line So but I would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something Yeah cause there's always that opposite story there Uh-huh It's quite different from when I was uh under doctor's care that's for sure I'm very thankful that I'm not under any doctor's care That's right Yes Uh-huh what part of uh Pennsylvania do you live in Well I have a brother that lives there Uh near uh Philadelphia Okay Are you a native Pennsylvanian Okay so I'm a former Michiganian so Yes it is it's very lovely it's a very lovely state Uh-huh uh-huh I'm sure it is uh-huh Uh-huh That has broadened so much also That is the fields that you know are opening up are um just phenomenal They look at the AIDS uh case you know that's a whole new field in itself it's an auto immune deficiency but it sure is a dilly one Yes I do too To eradicate it entirely yeah Well there's guidelines that people have to follow and if they're determined to uh have their cigarettes and the other uh carcinogenic causing items then how do you teach them I guess you That's true too It's I really believe our environment have a lot to do with it Yeah Well you just have to ban the smoking to their little room that they want to Uh-huh uh-huh Well it's a bad habit tha- Yes It's they say that it is Well it was nice talking with you And well you do the same And uh we'll be I guess talking around the country Okay you bye-bye
