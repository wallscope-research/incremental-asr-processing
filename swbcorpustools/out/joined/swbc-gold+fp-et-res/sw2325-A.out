Okay So uh then do you keep kids Is this two year old yours or do you keep children for other people Oh that's exactly what I have Yes I know I my little girl was three and a half in March and my son was two in January That's pretty close Yeah Yes it is Have you been able to do that all along or Yeah Oh how neat How old were they when you adopted So he probably doesn't remember Oh Yeah definitely needed Well pretty interesting Well I have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids you know That was always my dream you know I wasn't necessarily a career person but as long as I was single and had to work I was going to get a good job and do the best I could And my husband was in the type of business that you know it's insurance so you have to build a clientele and by the time we had kids I couldn't quit And so I haven't been able to quit yet So I've had to deal a lot with child care and course we're hoping within hopefully the next two years I'll be able to quit and stay home But uh I started out uh my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born until she went to work last year in August and it worked out pretty good You know we had always said from the beginning that if it gets in the way of the friendship then I'll take them somewhere else You know the friendship is more important And uh it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them you know She loved them like they were hers and I knew you know I had good peace of mind I knew that they were taken care of and Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Huh But she had no help She had no help She was alone with them Oh that is hard Yeah Jeez I don't either So Yeah You have to let them have some wild time if that's considered wild Yeah Right Right Yes Yeah Well when my friend decided to go back to work and whenever we had problems it worked out okay because she would come and tell me and we'd work it out After that I found another girl that had gone to church with us that you know they needed it financially She had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy and I though well you know we'll try her But she came to our house and that just did not work Uh she loved the kids and she was good with them But uh you know they were filthy when I'd get home Now I understand kids go out and play and they get dirty but filthy I'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair and the and I was like gosh And then you know my own furniture and stuff was like you know the kitchen table I'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs and the and clean and I was like Yeah And then in the end uh she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me so I had a pretty bad taste in my mouth She told me about five thirty one afternoon it was a Friday that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning Well you know I work eight to five thirty so what am I supposed to do So well I had been sick and I it ended up that I didn't go to work Monday because I was sick So I stayed home with them and we went to some of the Kindercares Yeah Well that's what they said There were two pretty near our house and they said well bring them in this week for a free day so I lined up someone Tuesday They had a Mother's Day Out that my baby-sitter took them to you know which was fine They liked it They had been going to it for years And so I stayed with them Monday Tuesday they went to that Wednesday I took them to one Kindercare Thursday I took them to another Kindercare and then Friday my husband and I split But on Thursday I didn't like the Kindercares They They didn't give him Oh Oh that's horrible And doing something with him Well not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month which I didn't have you know I you know we're a Christian family and you know because they're you know like public they're not private you know They can't pray they can't talk about God They can't do anything like that and I don't want them indoctrinated you know but I'd like them to be able to say gee God made the flowers you know and things like that Yeah Yeah basic So uh I talked to another lady at church It was like Thursday of that week and she said oh I found the most wonderful place that I've been taking my daughter and I've know this girl I went to college with her so I value her opinion And she told me about a private one it was associated with one of the churches here It's not the church I go to but it was Lubbock View Christian Church and it's a private academy And so I went over there and I talked to the lady Well they have like a three year waiting list But she said I had a mother tell me that she may take a job in San Antonio and she has a three year old and a toddler which mine was at the time And she said I should know something by tomorrow which was Friday and she said if she leaves she said I'll let you have her spot And so Friday afternoon at five thirty she called me and she said she's going You can bring your kids Monday I know I was just like God set this up for me He knew I needed this uh so since October then they have been going there and i- I love it I have been at such peace with myself It's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we don't have the little day to day hassles and the cost was not near as much as the Kindercares were going to be Did you hear my printer in the background I'm sorry I hope you can understand what I s- Yeah I was only about twenty dollars more a month than I was paying because being a private institution they're nonprofit So they don't have to charge as much And the hours are wonderful and I think it's the best thing I told Russ that we should have done this a long time ago you know It's great So I guess as long as I have to work I feel good that they're there they're getting the love the care They have a little curriculum They teach them you know the alphabet the numbers the things which you know if they learn they learn If they don't they don't I don't feel like I have to indoctrinate them by age three but it's kind of neat when they come home with it you know and uh Yeah Oh and the teachers Well Taylor got bit several times and Taylor bit several times and the teachers dealt with that We're like hey they're two and we keep them apart and we scold them and we correct them and you know they mark it all down and they let you know and you know they get over it real quick and he doesn't do it anymore and they work at the potty train- I just so mu I don't know I just feel like a big burden was lifted It is I know I know and that's hard Yeah Well and it you know but I understa- I wish you could find a good Mother's Day Out because that would be good for your peace of mind also Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah And that's usually like you know I don't know when mine were going to Mother's Day Out it was like from nine to three so that was a pretty good time you know My baby-sitter would take them and then pick them up So that worked out real good Well I'm tickled to death I hope you find something and it was good talking to you Well I guess It said child care criteria and I think we both listed an experience And you too Bye
