Hi fine I'm Nancy How are you I'm in Plano also Yes we're not too long distance today Oh that was good Utah I've had a couple of but that was it Yeah Learned about their basketball team Uh Jazz Yeah Yeah That's what I heard Yeah Yeah I am Okay Nancy Right Right Right Uh-huh Well I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job I'm a nurse and I work I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance and I make enough money by the hour to make up for that Right Uh-huh Yeah it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace And then I have my freedom I can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever I want to do Well it is to me Most people prefer the security of nine to five and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement and I'm just really not interested in all that Uh-huh Right Yeah Right and especially if you have a family Then I think it makes a big difference Yeah Right Oh yeah Right Could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it the same every week Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Oh well I guess retirement that kind of thing which I don't worry much about I just prefer to worry about today probably not a practical attitude but that's who I am so Uh-huh Right
