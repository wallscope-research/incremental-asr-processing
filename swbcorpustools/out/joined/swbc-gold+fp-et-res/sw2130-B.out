Yeah I read an interesting article in the paper that discussed uh that uh seemed that every other time a President tried to get support for an action like uh uh President Carter and his thing with the hostage crisis he always did it through rhetoric And this time President Bush did it through action and he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support or uh he left almost no alternative and it was very interesting how he did it and uh I'm an Air Force Officer so uh it was interesting for me uh you know I'd certainly uh I think it's great that all the support I have uh friends of mine from the Air I'm an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory but other guys here on base this is a B fifty-two base where I work so we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it Yes it was Yeah I don't know the exact figure but I would imagine that because of how close the vote was almost certainly would have to be Just based on uh the disparity of Democrats and Republicans in Congress he'd think that it would have to have been um And uh I gosh uh this whole thing now with uh all the political cartoons on the Democrats and how uh uh they're in a sad way for ninety-two now in terms of the presidential election anyway Yeah yeah Right right I think that was all those factors played a part in you know uh the everyone was discussing whether we should uh wait longer but I know that there's a lot of reasons to wait longer but I think we were genuinely concerned about their military capability and uh I think we over estimated it but still we were really highly concerned about it and we were worried that they were getting dug in and uh Yeah Right they couldn't yeah it's true they Saddam thought he had the whole thing uh figured out to which way we were coming and what our doctrine was uh That's right that's true That's interesting I think uh this political situation over there now is uh uh it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether this opposition will uh uh today the Turks uh agreed to support the Kurds which is something they've never done before and + uh needs slash And  uh this % the Arabs all of a sudden uh are cheering for Baker on his drive to reconcile relations with the Israelis so it's like Yeah I No uh I think I did hear that at one time a long time ago because I used to live in uh Massachusetts but uh Yeah New Hampshire Oh my gosh Uh Well I don't yeah I'd certainly uh support Israel in their policy in defending themselves and uh in their handling of their foreign policy I think the stand they have or the way the command respect I support that I think that is a positive thing for them after um uh thousands of years uh they ha- I think they in when they became a country they more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore and uh Yeah exactly exactly and uh um so gee I lost my train of thought here uh um so okay so I can't say whether that I'm pro Israel or anti Israel I'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region and looks uh that the joining of forces for this uh uh Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing Right Yeah somebody's going to and I think that's the problem the P L O has is that whenever one group of them decides that they're going to negotiate or they're going to do something they're going to try to make some peace uh the end result is that there so many factions of them uh some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or they split they end up becoming divisive themselves Uh I it's interesting I'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months but uh that's Yeah I know that's absolutely unprecedented that was an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the President and the State Department And that's never happened before and I don't know if it will ever happen again but Yeah okay uh I guess uh well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time All right Bye bye
