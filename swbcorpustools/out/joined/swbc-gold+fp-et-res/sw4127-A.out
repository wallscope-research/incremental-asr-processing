Okay I thought it was supposed to give a recording but anyway uh well I do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for my wife and for me and uh I embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial all I do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month but I doubt I do it more than three times a year And No I work with them all day I'm in computer science yet I do everything on paper Uh I don't even use a calculator for the stuff I'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers Uh-huh Yeah that Uh-huh Yes it's pretty straightforward It's almo- I can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making you know fancy budgets It seems like if you're getting to that level you're not in real good control Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Yeah Actually I like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills because that way it's a record of everything and I don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month Uh <> Yeah I guess if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do Uh-huh Sure Do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that or Uh-huh Well that's good to know Yeah I don't understand the idea of paying somebody to do it It seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it I Yeah just the form Yeah Yeah and a lot of them Yeah I don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer too much stuff like that because I want to make sure that I keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on I know too many people who use a calculator if they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention And it seem Yeah We have the same thing Yeah Sure <>
