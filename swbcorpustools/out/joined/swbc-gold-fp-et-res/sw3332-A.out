Doug you want to start You don't use any credit cards I don't imagine Yeah Uh-huh do you use them a lot Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh well that's an idea that's a thought uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh My husband loves them we do use them we try not to but he's one who believes in credit cards and he uses them quite a bit He likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month he likes that Uh-huh And that's when you get into expenses Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Well sometimes you do come on bargains and that and it's really useful And some places won't take you know like personal checks or cash even but they would take a credit card Uh-huh Right We yeah we have the same thing up here so we don't deal where they do that you know we go to places where they don't charge extra Some of them charge five cents a gallon even like the gas stations more And we just try to avoid you know the ones that do that we just don't go there because there's enough other ones around that don't charge you anything extra because actually to me credit cards are the same as cash to me they are anyway Right Right yeah Yes Yeah right Well I can't say we never have Now we have you know at times made payments on our things but we try not to We try hard Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Yeah because sometimes there's times when you maybe couldn't take advantage of something but with a credit card you can So  Well I think we're narrowing it down actually like I said my husband likes them and we have quite a few but when you get down to the nitty gritty there's probably three that we use most of the time Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh yes Well it's not every week but you do get them They make it very readily available Almost too much so But I really don't like it the charges that you know we try to look at that also what they charge per year to use our money you know they're charging us to spend our money and I'm not real crazy about that so we try to look at that also Uh-huh Right
