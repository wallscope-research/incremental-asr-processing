Hi Do you have lots of credit cards Uh-huh I used to have a ton of gas credit cards and now I have one or two of them but I think I've even let some of them expire But I was living out of the country for a while so I wasn't using them too much and I don't drive that much But I have you know MasterCard and Visa as you know I have a MasterCard and an American Express now I got rid of the Visa because it was getting out of hand having fifteen million cards But as long as like my MasterCard is free as long as you spend about I don't know three thousand dollars a year or something like that And so I tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card when I have the choice And I used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff The stores around here don't let you do it too much And so I don't But I was living in France and there you pay for everything by credit card but it's not really a credit card it's a debit card yeah And just you know many times you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash <> Bye thanks yeah Because they're just so well set up with it Right well Yeah I never pay finance charges on them except when I screw up which I occasionally do And you know I'll forget to pay the bill by the due date or this last month I mailed a check to them on the twenty-second and they didn't get it until the thirtieth and it was due the twenty-fifth And you know so I thought I and so I got hit up with a finance charge on it which pissed me off because you know I really did mail it in time But they have no proof of that I don't want to probably talk to them some more discuss it but I usually never pay finance charges I had that hassle one time and that went on for months and months and months and they eventually found the check and deposited it and months later they were still telling me that I owed them finance charges and late fees and things like that And I said well I mailed you a check and you eventually did deposit it So you know I guess I don't know who the burden of proof is on You know kind of the because you never d- when I pay bills I don't make a Xerox copy of it or I don't Right Or I don't mail them all a signed receipt whatever I you know at the bank to have a proof of when I mailed it And you can't do that it would be ridiculous Right Well you can Right Or I returned it so don't charge it yeah Well that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer and the computer didn't do what these people said it would do We need to just put external cards in and it wouldn't do that so he brought it back to them and they're supposed to modify it And so I called the credit card company and said well we haven't really taken possession because it's not useful for us We can't use it And then they said well then don't pay it And then a month later I had to dispute it in writing and I was out of the country and got back and I took care of it as soon as we got the computer back and it was okay I mailed off a check but then it was too late So now they're hitting me up there with a finance charge But it's sort of you know it's half our fault And so w- Right if I had filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually it would have been okay So I learned that for the next time Yeah Uh-huh Right yeah Yeah Well my husband and I both have that and I don't know what we pay for his card I pay I think I have a gold one so I think it's like seventy-five dollars for me and I'm not quite sure what it is for him But I had really like w- there nowadays I'm not so sure that it's worth it but in the past you know there are some places that only take American Express and then they don't have the credit limit because I've over done the credit limit on the other card if my husband and I both travel you know a couple of plain tickets and a little bit more and you're over the limit on the credit card And with the American Express they say there is no limit There really is but they tell you that but then that was one advantage but that's like I don't I think it's seventy-five dollars for me and forty for him for a year which is a lot Be n- Yeah well we should probably get another Visa card another one that's free Because there are some like I think A T and T has one that's free if you make two purchases a year Well so Yeah and so that's easy enough to do and if that's true it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit And get rid of the American Express because it costs so much No No I and I guess I do understand the mentality of people doing it but I don't understand Yea- because people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay I have had months where I was shocked at how much had come in because like I thought I would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process and sometimes it comes in right away and it's like well guess I have to pay that too Because like many times I'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking hey I won't get that bill until the next bill not this bill And it will come in on the next one you have to pay for it right away anyway But sometimes the is long Like I've had things that I didn't get billed on for two or three months Yeah Immediately Yeah but that's what happened with us like we bought a washing machine seven months ago and I got billed like the next day It didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check but we prefer g- like with the credit card you get the automatic one year guarantee so if something breaks things like that You can return it so like the washing machine we bought it in October and you know if something goes wrong with it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee And somethings like that are Right Or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be and so that's you know another advantage And then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which hopefully you never use But like if your bagga- but things like if your baggage gets lost you get money for that to buy new bags and things like that And yeah when you rent a car you get that and sometimes you get discounts with the cards and so
