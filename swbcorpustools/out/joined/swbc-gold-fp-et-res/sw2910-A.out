Well I do about the same I guess but in a different fashion I'm from New York originally and now that I live in Florida I live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the summertime and I feel that the only legitimate paper although it might sound a little elitist is the NEW YORK TIMES I've always read the NEW YORK TIMES when I was younger and I try t- now that it has a national edition I read that I guess I do watch MCNEIL LEHRER on P B S because I lean to that coverage and I guess I'm Yeah Well there it's a whole hour show Actually it's an hour show each evening and we turn it on when we start dinner We seem to start dinner around six and finish it up I find that I'm leaning on I travel a great deal even overseas and I find that I lean on C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff And I'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out I don't believe everything they say but it's coverage you know Yeah Yeah  Well yeah I Peter Arnet was reporting direct from Iraq I think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him I think he reported what he saw and if you didn't like it that was just too bad you know Yeah yeah  No that's right I think so and I guess when it comes to magazines I don't read I used to when I was younger I subscribed to TIME and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT I have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper or I also subscribe to something called WORLD PRESS which is a magazine that only talks about other excerpts from the WORLD PRESS which sort of gives you a different slant than it's not as slanted as the NEW YORK TIMES or as biased perhaps as the local paper But that I guess and the radio I listen to P B S radio a lot and I also listen to these twenty-four hour news stations when I'm driving I Yeah Do you read are you from Southern or Northern California So well Yeah what is that the San Francisco paper out there is the major paper Yeah and that's a terrible paper Is that pretty good what is that the CHRONICLE isn't it Oh yeah they really are probably the worse papers I've ever read I Yeah Well can you get the L A paper up there That's a pretty decent paper isn't it or Yeah Yeah Yeah Well that's another one I read I forgot that I read the WALL STREET JOURNAL not as in depth as I used to because their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer but Yeah I agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff I feel pretty well versed in what I'm doing because I do spend more time on that than I do say on sports although I watch that I spend a lot of time reading about these things I'm quite interested I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now today If anything I think they list- Well I don't know I hear a lot of criticism about listening to these the Dan Rathers of the world and taking their word for it or their comment actually I think they slant things but No kidding wow I didn't know that Yeah Yeah Yeah was he Yeah How do you feel about it I guess I got to say if the subject is do I feel that we're well enough equipped to I don't know if it said that I feel I'm well enough equipped Yeah To Yeah Yeah I think I do too I think you got to segregate some of it Well that's about all I have to say Nice talking to you Bye-bye
