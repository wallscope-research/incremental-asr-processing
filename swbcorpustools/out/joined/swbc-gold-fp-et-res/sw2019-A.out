do you have a pet Randy A poodle miniature or full size Uh-huh I read somewhere that the poodles is one of the most intelligent dogs around uh-huh So you've only known the dog how long did you say well is it how old is the dog it's still just a pup Yeah I have a well a mutt myself I call it a Chowperd It's part Chow and part Shepherd and it as I understand it both sides of the were thoroughbreds So she's a genuine Chowperd She has the color and the black tongue of a Chow but she has the shape of the Shepherd she weighs in at about fifty pounds so she's a medium size But she's big enough to be intimidating  Seems that this should end in a slash since A's next turn is an indep clause  it is a fixed female by the way see note above  and right from day one she was teaching me/ She's the most intelligent dog I've ever seen Course I'm a little prejudiced of course You know the first time I brought her home she was only was it six weeks old And I spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area But next morning she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom So on next night I spread the newspaper in the bathroom and she used them there But it wasn't too long until she found out she could wait until I let her out in the morning And since then I live alone and I live in motor home by the way I'm an full time R Ver and it's such a pleasure to come home at night and you can see her smiling from ear to ear she's so happy to see me And I don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not Uh-huh Well my dog's an outdoor type she does not like to be indoors 2 slash units  she'd rather sleep outside on the cold ground at night But I do make her come in And I feed her indoors that's to lure her in but during the day I have her on a leash which is on sort of a run I have a thirty foot cable running from one stake to another and then attached to that is a twelve foot leash so she can cover quite an area And she's the best burglar alarm going yeah she it's the strangest thing though children no matter how strange they are or how new they might be can walk right up to her but adults if they're strange to her or they look suspicious or something boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off And I have not discovered yet where the line is between children and adults But she is a great comfort to me Uh-huh uh-huh You mean she didn't appreciate all that attention/ Uh-huh What's her name by the way what do you call the dog Mitzi Mine is Gin As in martini Actually it's Gin two Because when I was a teenager in high school I had Gin one but then when I went out in the world I couldn't take her with me Uh-huh yeah what a shame Uh-huh well Well Randy we've just about used up our time here and I must say it was interesting I enjoyed talking about pets with you Maybe we'll get together again in the future Take care now Bye
