I really am I enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as I can Although you know I'm a full time student and  I work full time too so + {A not full time but } I work quite a bit so I mostly depend on the radio you know on the way to work I like to listen to national public radio all things considered Yeah and I like to listen to that and catch you know sometimes I don't get the current events you know Because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with you know some important issue on the day But Yeah Right that's right yeah Yeah Yeah you like N P Rs programming Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah h- yeah yeah Well we have a big newspaper situation because we used to have two newspapers up until last Sunday and one of our major papers just closed down They closed shop and said well we can't put any more papers out we're done Yeah I thought so it was a more effective paper as far as I was concerned it got to the news you know and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy which I like you know I like to save the editorial information or the politically weighted information you know for a different section I like just to you know find out what's happening pretty quick And I feel that the other newspaper the DALLAS MORNING NEWS is the one that's still here The TIMES HERALD is the one that closed up And the MORNING NEWS is okay but you know you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as I'm concerned You know many times it doesn't reflect my own opinion and Uh-huh No no that's the problem But you see Troy Aikman's knee surgery on the front page you know Yeah a quarterback for the Cowboys you know what I mean there is local news that really a lot of times doesn't change my life one way or the other So Right right yeah Not something you'll be interested in ten years from now by any means You know how about you I guess in Washington D C you guys have several papers that are pretty effective don't you Yeah Uh-huh Right Right yeah I have a question does the WALL STREET JOURNAL I've kind of gathered lately that maybe their information is not just only related to business is that a correct assumption Uh-huh Oh Oh Uh-huh Wow Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Do you find that you're disappointed or pleased with the performance of like network coverage of news Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah definitely Uh-huh
