Yeah Jonathan you say it's near and dear to your heart Buying a car is something you're contemplating I take it  Uh-huh <> Uh-huh They get Uh-huh what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I think the next car we get will probably be a well I like Buicks We have a Buick Century now it's a nineteen eighty-seven and whatever I get I want to have air bags both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody you know rather than have them stoop down to get over so I think the four door is probably a major requirement and other than that you know reasonable cost and safety and as much economy as you can get out of a car you know I'm not looking for one with a great big engine something that will carry it around careful I guess is best way to describe it Right now we've got a V six and that seems to be just fine I know they're coming out with some V eight now and I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age Uh-huh Right I drive a Ford truck I like trucks because they're spacious and it's handy to haul things it's not related to my business I just really use it basically for transportation but there's so many occasions when I've had to move some members of the family or do this or that and it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one Traction not really you know it's a two wheel drive truck and I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive I probably ought to be home anyway Wow Uh-huh what make is the mini van Mazda I see Right One of my sons has a Plymouth van or you know that same type of thing the Voyager I guess and they have a child that's five years old and it's really handy for hauling him around and their stuff and of course as he gets friends I'm sure that will be even handier So I know we're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value What about all wheel drive Is that something that you'd be interested in or is that Uh-huh Uh-huh Right
