So do you have an opinion on credit cards You do I think they get a lot of people in trouble Uh-huh Yeah and then you don't stop to realize that you know you charge this for twenty charge that for twenty charge this for twenty and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars and you don't stop to think about it I got in trouble when I was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble you know so I eventually got it all paid Now I carry one I have a gas card and a Visa card And I never use them unless I need to but they Yeah That's a good idea Stops all them interest rates and interest rates aren't none too shallow these days anyway But I know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially you know we have I'm in Lubbock and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot Yeah Gee Yes something like that <> Yeah Well my wife got in trouble one time with hers She was making like I don't know what she was making forty-five dollars a month I think And fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month So and that was before we got married so But it's you know we sat down and talked about it and discussed it and it's come out pretty good Now we have a eighteen year old that's fixing to get out of high school and go to college That's the first thing he wanted Yeah So we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick <> You know so But I think they're too readily accessible and there's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you trapped you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it but that's a lot of pain and hassle in the olden days when my parents were growing up and we couldn't afford everything we didn't have such things as credit cards We just waited until time come around that we could afford it And you know we had all the necessities so And I very seldom use a credit card on necessities I always use it for something I want not something I need So <> Yeah I think if cards were as stringent as say a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldn't have the problems we have Of course we wouldn't have the retail market we have either so I guess they trade one for the other I disagree with it but they still trade one for the other Well that's good I'm it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for you sound pretty young so Are you Yeah All right Oh Yeah Yeah it's pretty easy we have a eighteen year old seventeen year old and a seven year old <> Yeah are you <> you're a Mormon then <> all right What's that yeah they must not have too much traffic on Saturdays fifteen or twenty I guess yeah I try to every day I get calls at work I get calls at home so
