Well this is an unusual topic What do you think about it Well that sounds great Ellen How far away do they come from okay okay that makes sense Nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than once Uh-huh Yeah That's interesting You sound like you've had a lot of experience with this then Southern California's still pretty large I see  Yeah well my experience has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side and they haven't had a reunion since then They just show up at funerals and weddings It was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that but anyway my mother's side we had our first real reunion that I've ever gone to last summer and they had people come in from out of town and they took some rooms down at a Holiday Inn and they had some activity they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree and you know a lot of that sort of thing Since it was the first one that we'd had you could do that once Now next time we have one we'll have to think of something more creative to do  Well do you have an interest in genealogy Not a passion I suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy and I suspect we will do more of it I found about some of the relatives I didn't even know their names some of the two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles and there's a lot of things there you have to stop their really kind of fascinating I found out my grandmother was one of a twin And we don't even know where the twin we have virtually no background on the twin My grandmother's sister who would be somewhere in West Virginia I'm sure she's you know dead now because my grandmother died about twenty years ago I'm probably a lot older than you are I don't know
