Well Well yes I do this is a question that hit pretty close to home I had to go through this with my dad about four years ago his health was failing and he was adamant about two things One was that I take care of my mother and two that he not be put into a home And we talked about some length and I respected his wishes He stayed at home as long as he could and then he died in a hospital But I think that my position is that you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care  of the of their  clients and because I've heard about the many abuses and because he had heard of so many abuses he just didn't want that How about you Yeah all over thirty percent isn't it Uh-huh They're captive at one stage we had care somewhat like what you're talking about We had the Visiting Nurses program and they sent somebody in and it was a nominal charge that it started out that the lady would come in I think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day They would try to get him to exercise They would try to you know they would check him over to you know the basic checks Try to get him to talk and be motivated and that's what we went through up to a point things seemed to be working and then I think he became discouraged and they did not know how to take care of that and then at that point I think it's mostly a psychological problem And but yes I agree there's a lot of options There could be a lot of options I think it's time that we decide to do something about it  I suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need Yeah the church or synagogue whatever because typically these were close knit groups at one time but in today's large metropolitan areas or even the rural areas now people are not quite as close as they once were the mobility factor the factor that we're living longer and people are less trusting all these things tend to destroy this type of system But I agree with you there might be some possibilities there Although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do I think they would have to have some training
