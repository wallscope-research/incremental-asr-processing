Okay do you have any pets now Yeah okay that a matter of choice or compulsion Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Well right now I'm a student and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that No we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat Yeah They're very strict about it I love animals I was raised our house when I was growing up there was almost never at least one cat in the house It was almost always at least one cat sometimes you know like fifteen or twenty But always cats in the house Oh Yeah How old are your kids Okay One Our first He's about eleven weeks now Yeah Yeah originally West Virginia I don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country but Charleston West Virginia Okay that's pretty much the south end of the state or the southern quarter of the state anyway Okay in the north end of the state you've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania Right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown Yeah yeah It's well my parents' house is like three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far So it's beautiful well from my neck of the woods it's hilly you know maybe four hundred feet elevation type variations from the valleys up to the hilltops not a lot of farmland there Mostly it's you know there's you know individuals growing their own food most of the agriculture it's more in the way of sheep and cattle And even that's you know small time mostly the biggest chunk of what's going on there is industry It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants aluminum plants There's like two aluminum plants Computer engineering just finished up my fourth semester Yeah Yeah it's a big change I spent twenty years as a mechanic so Yeah Yeah I'm working on a bachelor's degree I'm working on a bachelor's degree It'll be compu- Pardon it seems to me from what I've been able to find out That's considered a pretty good program It's nice and small which means you know if you don't get the class this semester then you've got to wait you know anywhere from two to four semesters to get it again But it's worth it once you get it yeah yeah Most the class are pretty small That works out real well well first off we'd probably wind up with a cat or maybe a puppy I'm partial towards the larger dogs our last we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus had a hamster or two and they got to be a lot of fun it's amazing how much character
