Well for a lot of years I've pretty much flied without one and just recently we set up a budget and we're trying to stick to it We just bought a new house So you know pretty much we know what our fixed expenses are per month and then we've got some ones that are variable that pretty much stay within a certain range then there's the ones that you never know anything about and that's the food Yeah well the utilities are pretty much you can pretty much figure what they're going to be and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you Uh-huh Yes sir Well I used to know fairly close to exactly how many miles I drove because I lived nine tenths of a mile from work so it was you know two miles a day to and from work So it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot But now I've just bought a new house and I'm a half hour and so my transportation costs have gone up by five times Yeah pretty much The problem is there never seems to be enough money I have three children and it seems like the more money you make the more money you have the more things that they seem to need and of course nothing ever goes down I remember I have five children total I have three left in the house And I can remember years ago when school would start and I'd go buy all five kids you know shoes and I could get out of the shoe store without spending more than thirty-five dollars Nowadays thirty-five dollars buys about one pair of shoes yeah so I mean things have just really gone out of sight in I guess about the last ten years I'm exempt Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh I've got two older cars There both one's a seventy-seven and one's a seventy-eight And my insurance it was running about four hundred dollars a year But when I moved to the new town I live in because it's a different county which has less crime and you know less highways and so it's a cheaper place to live as far as the insurance company's concerned so I think my insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year It's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars Yeah I was down in Texas for two years and I was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance Yeah  they have no fault in Maryland also Yeah Uh-huh Yeah it's kind of strange here the way things go here if you have an accident and no one's injured the police won't even show up Nope They say if nobody's injured you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company Well if you I don't know how familiar you are with Maryland but especially the center part of Maryland where I Ninety-Five runs through it is really heavily populated There's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it'd take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic No Not a bit Yes sir I spent couple of years down there Moved down there in eighty-seven and moved out in eighty-nine right here in Maryland Yeah my family didn't like Texas and I had a chance to transfer up T I bought a company about seven months after I moved to Texas right here in So I got an opportunity to transfer back and I took it Uh-huh Yeah Yeah believe me I know there is I lived in Plano and I don't know if you're familiar with Plano but maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas Everybody else was an import Uh-huh Yes Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah they have a state income tax in Maryland But I noticed when I was in Texas they didn't have a state income tax but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and school taxes and property taxes my God ate you alive Yeah Yeah it sure does there's some good books that I've read that you might be interested in Charles D Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night T V and he's got seminars you can go to and they try to hook you into his organization which costs about four hundred bucks But he's got a couple of books out One of them is called WEALTH WITHOUT RISK Yes it's a very good book It's tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then what to do with the money that you save Yes yes legally cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to you know be wealthier he also has a new book out that I purchased right before I moved and haven't had a chance to crack it open yet FINANCIAL SELF DEFENSE is the name of it the man has a lot of good ideas some of them I already knew about some of them I had already practiced But I suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because Yes I'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety-one Yes Yet Yeah I know what you mean when I was in Dallas I was supervisor and I had four non exempts under me And I was appalled at how they were paying them I just couldn't believe it Yeah yeah Well this company that they bought they ended up buying a very high payroll And you know I thought I was making a good wage
