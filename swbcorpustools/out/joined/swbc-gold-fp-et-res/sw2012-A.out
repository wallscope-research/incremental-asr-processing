Well the first thing for me is I see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is if an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state that's one thing and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that's another And the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me and very much everyday in this country but in the second time at least overtly where someone comes in and finds out information about you that should be private does not seem obviously everyday That's right Uh-huh Right it turned out to be an invitation from personal parties or from these phone commercial things that's a remarkable number I get them rarely and I'm still astounded that one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effect in this whatsoever because I'm usually so insulted by them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what they are I think they prey on people's inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it I would prefer to not to be known and you know the classic I don't know C I A conspiracy theories or whatever would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge So there's things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia It's a surmise and I'd like to think that it's quite low at least in this country I don't think I'd like the K G B monitoring my phone or anything like that Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Well you must have a relatively clean conscience then Yes yes more harmed or something Yeah Yes I did I was just about to write a letter when I heard they canceled it Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh They had you pegged Yeah Yeah Yeah And one of the problems with the Lotus data base was that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information they said they would give it out to only select companies but you know just like software is only given out to customers you can't believe that it would be pirated and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering you know full cash price for it you know you can't tell it what a company really has to do with it and there's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are and that hacker just has to get in touch with the sneak thief and suddenly what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home Yeah Yes Exactly Uh-huh I also thought about it waiting to talk to you that another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how to behave such that there isn't But I realized I have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy If I deviate from social norms of behavior if I run up and down the street yelling or something someone's going to invade my privacy very quickly And I realize that I can take that for granted but I used to live in India and things are quite different there in terms of that There's less of a sense of privacy In fact it's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy certainly the language I know doesn't but just says a word for loneliness Loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different Yeah it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially so there's not doors don't have latches on them People don't tend to knock you just if there's a door closed and you open it because it's in your way people walk in out and as a westerner in India I was often surprised and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded You know it very much is But on the other hand I realized I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic and people would leave me alone Whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and then act like the lunatic you violate the norms of public behavior people start paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in the sense are invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it But it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms which isn't always the case in all cultures and it wasn't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized that's actually something that's culturally relative Uh-huh uh-huh And that's really well I wonder how people have sex and things like that  you go to India and you know the results of sex are quite obvious as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years but I just don't quite there's hope I actually for al- of the time I've spent there I still don't quite understand how certain things that I assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy Because anyone can be alone for some period of time but for me a lot of what I do requires a sense that there's this invisible barrier around me which people will respect And if that's gone I really don't know how to live very well and I really do wonder how people do that All the other classic examples the Jehovah's Witness or Mormons or someone knocking at the front door which is more intrusive because I have to really tell someone to go away And there's that sense of I have now opened my door they now see what I look like what I live like and they're doing something that normally I really only invite people to Because I anyone I give my number to is welcome to call me but no one is just welcome to come by my house So that is more of a sense of invasion
