Okay we use them for paying our gas and for paying just about anything because we don't like to pay for our checks So we use it quite a bit but we pay off every month though so we never have to pay interest and we never get the credit cards if there's a monthly or a yearly charge We always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free So we never have to pay anything extra Yeah we just don't think it's worth it So See well I don't do it either Yeah Yes exactly that's how I fe- it's a rare day when I even have seventy-five cents in my purse Yeah Yeah because if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something Yeah and I think it's more convenient too in a lot of cases like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our Visa or our Mastercard or whatever And then you know we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later and so it helps us gain interest in the bank when we do it we come out even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later yeah Yeah even if it's five bucks even Yeah And also if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within I think it's twenty-four hours you can report it in and he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had and if whoever tried to you know credit it to the hilt you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it and then you know you can have your card back with pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever I know Yeah exactly Yeah sure it's just a precaution for everybody Yeah so  I also like to use Discover when I can because they give you some money back every year Yeah yeah Well we just started doing that and you know what it comes in handy for when you're buying things like tickets for the train or airplanes because they'll give you some money back you know and it's only a little bit but it's still something We got two fifty last year and so you know it helps out here and there So Yeah I think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesn't sound like a thing but you know when you add up everything you've charged up on the Discover card for a year and they give you a half percent of that and that adds up to you know two fifty or something And so that's what and I know we're going to get back more this year because you know we spent a little bit more probably and they do it for how long you've been a member I think too and they increase the percentage a little bit
