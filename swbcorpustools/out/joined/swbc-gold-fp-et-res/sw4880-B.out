Okay Well I'll let you start I guess no I'm not my employer does not do that although I had an ex-employer that the previous job I used to have they I guess a few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test I don't know My feeling is that certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb if should somebody be under the influence of drugs I'd be willing to support that For example well train engineers Because you know like there was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer you know he crashed and killed some people because he was smoking some marijuana and I guess air traffic controllers I wouldn't want them to be on drugs And airplane pilots But in that regard where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property I would seriously question it so So it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent Yeah Well i-  Right And Yeah yeah I agree well there's also the issue of out here I remember hearing a year or so ago that a lot of there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results or I shouldn't say high I mean several percent Kind of a coarse kind of test Is that done Right Now let me ask you this at the time you hired on with this company was that prior to any Okay so this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this
