<> Well I haven't tried but this is I haven't called in a couple of days but education in public schools I have a son who's graduating in May and there's some interesting problems of how do you challenge the kids today And I have some real hang-ups I think that if your kid's not ambitious he can sure get lost Yes In North Garland he goes t- What school system are you familiar with Y- okay well I have a daughter that's in the I B program at Garland In the are you familiar with the International Baccalaureate program do your kids go to Garland High you said okay Well there's a it's she went from Austin Academy when it opened up over to North Garland for ninth grade But at North Garland the difficulty I see with the education system is that you can get some masses but unless if the kid's really dedicated it seems like they do all right But if your child is just pressing along I I'm firmly convinced that teachers aren't being paid enough Would you argue with that Well you know the thing that I don't see and maybe you would take issue with it is that if there was an opportunity for teachers to teach year around Well would Well how do we get that Yeah Does it work well out there Well what about the issue of air conditioning Isn't that an area of concern in the cost of air conditioning yeah Yeah Yeah it's less degree days you're right But I think Yeah well how do they do it Do they put long do they put two or three week breaks between Is that from what you've seen is that the desirable way to do it you said you had some people from California I thought you okay But you didn't go Well the other issue that I hear that the local commentator I listen to some the idea that the numbers of administration and the fact that the principal do you see that the principals aren't really in charge Well I had heard that one of the comments when they brought it Then why the the one they brought in the new superintendent for Dallas schools the admini- can't think of his name but the idea yeah that he had suggested that maybe they could reduce the number of administrators and some of the people who were administrators saying that's not what he was hired for But they resented the fact that he would try to save some costs there  Well you know the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that it took to contest the football issue Yeah but the I can't think of the name of the school that but in any event they kept arguing Yeah And they went to court i- you know guess I'm sympathetic with the kids but how much money did that cost Dallas to fight that in court But just think of all the all the lawyers you've kept employed see That's right and all these other people are out running around I guess that's the only problem with jobs being relatively scarce But you need to keep all these people employed right and you mean we need a little more of our tax money like maybe Yeah that's that's interesting and how many administrators is that going to take Yeah Yeah well that's part of where my son would like to go to Rice but I don't think he's well the difficulty is the people that get in are overachievers And he's not an overachiever But the same time everybody can't go but it the question you know of how far should you take a kid in the motivation I'm not sure I think maybe there's too much responsibility put on the teachers to motivate these kids I had a friend that was administrator in Richardson said if the parents read books then the kids probably would read books But that a lot of the schools I would think the kids you're talking to question of how much reading do those kids' parents do Well Well but that's the point as I would say and that's what makes there's a lot of problems But anyway I'm trying to think how much longer I had a conversation week or so ago and we got carried away and they cut it beeps in at ten minutes So So anyway  Well see that's in the Garland schools the numbers I don't think they have to do that because most everybody passes Well opportunity right If you get graded on percent improvement But see that Yeah And unfortunately that's tough that's a real challenge though But Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Well yeah you know our son had that he had an attention deficit disorder and they were keeping him from recess and in reality that's one of those really tough situations I think the kids need some time to play But if more people like you though that understand the problems get in and change some education so I got some background noise there but I guess <>
