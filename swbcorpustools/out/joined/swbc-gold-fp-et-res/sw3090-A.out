Okay well do you keep a family budget or do you have some Uh-huh interesting Yes well we sort of started doing it years and years ago and my husband started graduate school when we were first married and I sort of just got in the habit I guess And you know never have gotten out of it I cannot really say that it's a formal budget it's more just a fairly accurate recording of what I spend and what I think I am going to have to spend And Yeah Yeah Yeah Right Yeah That sounds real similar  my yeah Yeah Sure Yeah I think you are right well it must have been sort of interesting to us it's because since I have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years I guess I can go back and look and it's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years For instance My goodness dear Yes yes Well as a matter of fact my mother was going through some things not long ago I guess it has been a couple of years ago in an old trunk that she had And she came upon a budget book that she had back in the thirties when they it was the late well I guess I will take that back it must have been in the forties because they had been married probably fifteen years at the time And it was just fascinating to see how little things cost it was just almost laughable in some instances that you know of course it's all relative of course but never the less it was fun to see those figures next to you know for a pair of shoes was like five dollars and  Oh isn't that something Really that is really something That's true Yeah that's right that's just good old economics working Well we have tried to instill some sense of budgeting in our kids but our two children are just as unlike as night and day And our son could care less about a budget and our daughter watches her pennies so closely that she almost just sounds like your father she has everything planned so closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a loop Yes Right yes Yes Yeah I think that is true I and I think that is probably what happened in our house because I think my husband was not quite as good at saving and so on before we got married and I was really diligent about that I was putting money aside before I was married you know when I was working out of college and that really paid off Because when time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts And Yeah he is an engineer he is an electrical engineer And in fact went through many years of graduate school and got his P H D so we had a lot of years of budgeting And you know Yeah When you yes Well I'm working on my masters degree now so in fact this last year we had three both of the children were in college our son has a year left and our daughter graduated this year and I'm just about ready to finish my masters degree so we have had once again you know a real lean year for us But Yeah Yeah yeah you know exactly what it's like then And it's which you learn I guess you figure that that is an investment that is really invaluable Uh-huh Yeah That is right so it's one that you can live through And I think that that's the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel You know that it was worth it to save and to not have something and in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it so it really makes it easier but well I have enjoyed talking with you Jerry And I wish I could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me I am interested in that Oh wow Well my husband and I just went there last year actually we did not take a tour we were in England and went to Ireland and Scotland and just rented cars and did it on our own but I that sounds interesting Is your business in Dallas then Okay you are kidding Well I'm going to be teaching at Brookhaven in the fall Kuenzer K U E N Z E R and I'm Uh-huh Z E R And I will be in the communications department teaching English One Oh One to I have a couple of sections Yes yeah that's the guy who hired me yes Fantastic Well it's been a good type conversation Bye-bye
