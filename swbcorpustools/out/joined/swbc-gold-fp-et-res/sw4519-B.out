I start Okay Well we keep a budget to an extent and we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm paid once a month which sort of forces some restrictions and you need to make sure all your bills are paid about yourself Yeah Well I guess that really is sort of keeping a budget you know You stay within your means Yeah Yes you moved from Dallas to San Francisco That is a hugh difference Yeah But you have good sour dough and it's a beautiful place to live Yeah Labelled as an indep slash unit since A's next turn is so voluminous before B24  Uh-huh See B22 note  Yeah Well that's a system too Well then again you know you said you are able to take trips And you do obviously have enough to live on so I guess you're indirectly budgeting just bye-bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal in spending the money So that's a form of budgeting I would think <> it's kind of a strange topic for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money Yeah well we have one on the way my wife and then we're having one on the way in September No I think it's just going to be one How about yourself  Do they budget at all do you have them on an allowance Yeah Yeah
