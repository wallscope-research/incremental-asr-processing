I don't really know what to think about it but I do know that they're not you know they'll give somebody twenty-five years and they'll serve what eight months Have you noticed that Uh-huh and But I think trial by jury it's a lot better than leaving it up to one person Leaving it up to the judge okay Yeah well right because the general public doesn't know that if they're sentenced to life that they won't serve life Course the judge will know when he'll be up for parole and all that So yeah Okay I must not have understood the whole thing because I didn't hear them say that but yeah Uh-huh But I think if the entire trial was left to one person I've got a four year old you can hear But I don't know you too many people can take vendettas out on people and everything Right but that's true Yeah Right because they know that you're biased Does it have to be unanimous Well then they consider it a hung jury I think and then they have a retrial or do they Uh-huh No me neither Well you don't have to be really convinced that he's guilty just if they can't prove he's guilty because Yeah I would hate to be that person because you would be you know bombarded by all the other eleven jurors to you know just say he's guilty so we can get out of here and go home should this be in the above slash unit The slash unit should end here Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I know it's too bad one of us don't have some knowledge on this huh but I don't know I just hope if I ever go to court that they all unanimous on not guilty Well you've seen like these T V movies <> Kyle I'm talking hush <> But well how they'll you know the through the whole movie you think this person's I don't know but one thing that I thought was pretty weird is how somebody can't be tried twice for the same crime Well I just think it's weird because I've saw well of course soap operas I'm an soap opera fanatic This one guy had framed himself to make it we- which he really did kill the person but then he set it up where it looked like somebody was trying to frame him and he was on trial for it and then you know it came out that he was being framed so then he was found not guilty and then th- directly after the trial they found out he really was guilty and he couldn't be tried again Yeah beca- No I don't think they can You know I saw it on L A LAW too Yeah about that woman Right and I'm sure that you know it's the lawyers after the defendant defending the defendant's lawyer and the prosecuting attorney I'm sure the prosecuting attorney could make a real good case if he you know knew all the details of the defendant's you know case Right Right like if they're on trial for rape you can't bring up the sexual assaults and stuff or whatever Yeah I know if it's related if it's related to the crime they should be able to Yeah Right yeah But they're not allowed to do that Well that one does seem out of it though because you're allowed to show their character do you know what I mean And if it shows that their character's you know <> capable of lesser thoughts like that and stuff Right that led to that Tell you what we need to do is go into law and then we'll be able to or vote Do you vote Yeah do you vote Okay we- you'll help out a little bit Putting the right people in the office that's a lot to do with it too a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the general public wants so they'll be revoted and all that Right Right Right they sit on the fence so Well I talked about this the other day they won't say yes and they won't say no to certain issues just because they don't know what the public wants or the public's split on it Yeah Right because most of it is politics even in the courts Right Uh-huh now was that I don't know some guy that was attacking women jogging No Well did they have a T V movie about him Well well how was he killing the women Were they jogging on a okay  see that's what I mean then they let them out and then they're able to do it again I think my sister is married to a guy from Rochester Yeah Yeah way up nor- well I'm originally from Kentucky Yeah I was up north too But that's one of the reasons I think judges should be the ones to sentence people because they do know you know if you sentence them to three life times then they probably won't get out on parole Uh-huh Well of course But they just need to do something with him He needs to be annihilated Yeah Well it's supposed to be a jury of your peers they couldn't have a bunch of psychotics up there Uh-huh Did they have a trial by jury for him well
