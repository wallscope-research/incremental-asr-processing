Okay Do you have any children Uh-huh I don't any children so I'm going to have difficulty with this topic But what kinds of things do you and your family do slash error should be 'b' Uh-huh slash error should be 'b' Then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days I don't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that That's great Yeah Uh-huh That's great I think a lot of families now they probably don't spend enough time together You know whether their parents are together or divorced they don't spend enough time together and I think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is being destroyed Just simply because that time isn't spent just doing things like fishing and I think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot And the communication helps just build your family Uh-huh Yeah to me that's pretty rare I like that Whenever I do have children I'm going to try as hard as I can to see that we spend a lot of time together you know maybe just even if we just rent a movie and watch it together just to make sure that everybody's not going out and doing and their her own thing all the time You know that's good sometimes because you need to you know get away But I don't think you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of losing the family unit Uh-huh Yeah Yeah And as I understand it I don't know I haven't experienced it but slash error you know kids these days are growing up so much faster slash error should be sv And once they hit like ten or eleven or twelve you know you've pretty much lost them Yeah So do you think that your family is pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter Uh-huh What do you think is the key to just bringing the American family back together What kinds of things do you think can Yeah that's true slash error I think that's the first thing a lot of people do and I know I'm guilty of it Like I came in from work today first thing I did was turn the TV on Because I taped the stories from earlier today And I like to watch 'em but I think that's that is a big problem The television and it's too static you know it's something that you can do but there's no thinking involved no motion you know and I think that's another reason why people are so health conscious now is because America's becoming really a couch potato society You know people aren't doing anything just sitting around you know no thinking involved and now I think people are trying to get out of that At least and there's a lot of it's becoming really health conscious and that people are you know starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that And that's probably good you know if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that that also helps That's also something you know family oriented that everyone can do  Uh-huh how old is she Well she has Yeah yeah You've still have a lot of time before she gets up in years That's good That's good Okay Well it was very nice talking to you Okay Bye-bye
