Okay you go first Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well yeah it's pretty much what I was going to say there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in I grew up in New York and the place or not New York City upstate New York and I went to the City of Rochester School District and a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs and we weren't too far removed geographically from each other but the difference in schools I think was pretty substantial and one of the things that probably would have been better is if the entire county had just one school system And that could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was you know all the very rich people move out to the suburbs and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with As a result the schools were rundown there wasn't as many you know of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked There wasn't as many advanced placement courses when I was a senior that some other schools had And it so you know I think that one of the ways to help schools in general and get them all to a minimum level of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the problem with that is then the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away to get better schools So you know it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Why is that Why is that Right Right Right Uh-huh Yeah yeah Yeah I know that was a big factor for me I ended up coming out of the public school system very well and was very good education ended up getting some scholarships to go to college you know which is really nice and I think the difference for me was that they were always there was like well yeah of course you're going to study and do well and that's the way of course are you
