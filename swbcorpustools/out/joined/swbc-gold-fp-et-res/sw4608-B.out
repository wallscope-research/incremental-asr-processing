Well Minneapolis isn't too bad I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders that's kind of gone up in scale and some other things I personally had a little experience the other day somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck But actually you know when you look at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live it's really quite a bit better because I came from Florida and in Orlando crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever so What part of California are you from really I have a good friend there Yeah yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah that's <> That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like Sure Well interestingly enough right before I moved up here I'm an intern and then I go back down in May but in Orlando before I moved up we had a real problem with it we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks And one of the things that I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there because they were just it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work you know and then the houses were left unguarded but yeah I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it that's a good way to work it with a neighborhood watch is that right Oh That's amazing Yeah  Yeah it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter Really you know Yeah unfortunately it's starting to really you know look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit and the crime level there of course is quite a bit more pronounced but yeah I guess I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis I'm not real sure Pretty much Yeah I was basically involved in that in the organization of it And then I left right in the middle of it I'm not sure where we went from there but Yeah that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious activities like that sure Yeah Yeah Yeah One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps it's against the law to do a lot of things you know They could basically when I was getting robbed down in Florida I was really considering electrifying doors things like that like they did in Miami that time That's not always true No there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed and essentially what he had done is set a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home The guy came in while he was home and sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned He didn't die but he was severely burned and he took the guy to court and won a settlement Yeah So that makes you think you know It's like your hands are very much tied
