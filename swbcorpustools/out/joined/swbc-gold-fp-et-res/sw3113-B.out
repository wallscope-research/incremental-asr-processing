Okay Right Right I agree too I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down I think the judges should or even a panel of lawyers if it got to that point Might be better than just regular civil people Not knowing you know exactly what things are from murder on up to like tax stuff you know Right Yeah and Right that's yeah and most people that do sit on juries some people just sit on them once in their lifetime you know if they're that lucky sometimes Or you know whatever the case may be and may not have any idea of what the standard punishment would be for it And they may have some different idea it might be more important for them to put a sentencing down that was longer you know that the punishment didn't fit the crime Or not long enough or you know whatever the case may be I think the judges do have that better knowledge of it The only thing I worry about sometimes is if you get somebody in there that has a name that is the defendant and you know sometimes might have more pull which does happen we can't say it doesn't because it does happen not everybody has the right morals sometimes People can be paid off politically or whatever the case may be and sometimes that's not real fair either though so Uh-huh Right Right Right well also what I don't think is fair either is when you have say a rapist come in and his attorney gets his sentencing reduced because he's gone to a lesser charge like I don't know what assault or something or But which doesn't make any sense to me either I know it's hard to prove rape and whatnot and the person that was raped or whatever doesn't I mean it's embarrassing and all this other stuff and they're put on like they were the ones that caused it or whatever but to me when you do the crime then you should pay for whatever you did and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge I don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say well you know that was a breeze I can go out and do it again and you know have the same thing happen that's not right Right Uh-huh Yeah And to me how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of whether it pertains to the case or not somebody thinks it had because they've got it there So the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information Don't they They only put part of it Yeah Right Well that's just like that old witness game well it's a game kids play too but somebody did it just for your train of thought where they showed something and they asked there were like four people
