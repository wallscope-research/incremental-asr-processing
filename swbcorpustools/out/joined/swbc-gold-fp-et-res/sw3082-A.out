Okay Well this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we're going to a family reunion this weekend Yeah Down at Lake Texoma lodge Yes this is one that's the Baker family reunion and this has been going on I would say at least twenty-five years or thirty something like that Maybe longer than that I'm going to get back into the fifties sometime First time I married into the family and the first time I went was about fifty-seven I think But this one has been well organized and in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood and now it's Lake Texoma because that's more central location for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to Very important because you'll start losing people if it's too far to go Yeah Never get them at both places Right Well listen they've had this one well it just of course over the years it has built up as far as the organization is concerned but now they have a golf tournament on the Saturday And then they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such Yeah and they get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge and everyone brings in food and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant and it really has worked out generally I think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people I think normal's about sixty or seventy Oh Oh Yeah Right Yeah well our family reunion started out my wife and I were the kids the newlyweds so to speak and now our children go and our grandchildren are going now So it's wound up that we're the old folks now But they have various organized they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes to pitch and they organize a baseball game for the kids and several people bring boats and there's a place they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon so it's a full day Some of the people come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend and some just come in for Saturday so it has worked out quite well and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long except that once a year Yeah my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia and I think we've been to one in thirty-five years or something like that so That's just too far away Yeah It's an all day drive just to get to this area Yeah Yeah Yeah we have each year of course they elect officers of the family reunion and a number of years ago back in the early eighties my wife was president We discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together And it takes a lot of planning and assembling of stuff Right That's correct Yes it is I tell you I don't really care for her to be president again But it's a lot of work but it's a lot of fun We've enjoyed it and the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma Yeah and this year they're all excited The show this weekend this weekend's going to be a rock and roll show my two grandsons and one of their cousins are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know in jeans and t-shirts and such So it's going to be exciting for them and for us too yes there have been some really wild shows put on there They really get into it Yeah well that generally happens Yeah Yeah well we've had various things over the years to raise funds for it and again it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting room down in the cabins and such but they've come up with they've tried passing the hat and they've had auctions and various things to raise funds and some people do and some people don't But anyway that's the family reunion story Okay Been nice talking to you Bye
