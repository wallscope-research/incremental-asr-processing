Okay Ron Welcome to the net and what did you do about your last auto repair and might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth  My goodness gracious that's Well that's still not enough for a total is it It's a very expensive automobile and do you buy one every two years Uh-huh Did this car have one of these expanding balloons or just are there normal safety belts in it that you had Did that help you They didn't go off But you were hit in the side weren't you That may be the problem you may need to be hit leaning towards the forward to activate it My goodness Uh-huh My goodness I would think so This doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one Well I'm relatively fortunate about that here we somehow don't have many people run into us although at the beginning of each school season students move into town who are from big cities and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two three weeks then they finally settle down and realize that they don't have to drive that way here And now that takes the strain off of everyone that is driving a vehicle and I find that the most of the repairs I have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to take care of us in the winter time I have a sixty-nine cougar and a seventy-seven pontiac so forth and I have to and I drive a Honda most of the time and <> I have to make sure that salt and so forth are kept off of it and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it's rusted away Uh-huh Well I had this Cougar the body of it totally rebuilt to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders done and then it all repainted and then winter got here and so I put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off <> so I haven't had a chance to drive it very much But anyhow now are you going to buy this next car or you going lease it again Are you Uh-huh Well that's an awfully big one that one that you had that Lincoln isn't it too large for normal town driving finding parking places and getting in and out the doors Uh-huh Yeah Well that certainly would be a wonderful comfortable machine to take on long trips I'm very much aware of that Yes I'm sure it is because that's the way that I enjoy this Pontiac that I have It only has thirty-eight thousand miles on it but it's very quiet and very smooth riding machine Uh-huh do you feel that
