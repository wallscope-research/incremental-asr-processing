Okay all set then what do you think about it Uh-huh I didn't realize that Uh-huh Okay Uh-huh yeah that's right I have heard I don't remember what they call it sort of like a positive negatives or some kind of word they use when you get a positive indication of drugs but there weren't really any there every now and then there's an error and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated Yeah I work here at Texas Instruments so let me think do we yeah everyone coming in I guess I did three years ago Everyone coming in goes through the drug testing procedure and they talk about it as better for the country and better for the working conditions So if they test for drugs I can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore I know we did in the military but I don't know if once your in they continue to do it but I guess you're always on call for it Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh B- Uh-huh right So your big beef with it is the it's a good idea but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better Make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever Yeah I tend to agree with you David Yeah my brother used to work for Wal-Mart and then I don't know if he still does or what because I don't know if Sam's is actually part of it but he you know is working at Sam's now Okay yeah then he's been working for the company for a while too He Good company You all have some he's telling me about good profit sharing and all that so It's good news Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that's what my brother was telling me That's good deal Well how long were we s- I haven't done this in a couple months How long were we supposed to discuss for Okay we got a couple more minutes then I guess think what else I can say about that Right everyone coming in goes through the drug test no well let me think about that Yeah it was after I had already been hired Yeah you get hired then you come in the first I seems to me I remember that I was hired came in and went through some orientation and I thought I boy I can't remember That would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test Maybe it was during the interview I came up a couple times for an interview so it's hard for me to remember where I was when all that happened But I guess just like other companies other friends I've been hearing about that have been moving around it's before They have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment so I'm sure that happened to me too what about they just instituted it there at Wal-Mart so Right
