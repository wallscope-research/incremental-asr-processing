Well I think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately the invisible hand that which Adam Smith wrote has provided some very good health care and much I think inadequate health care and in some cases the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces and I think it's inevitable It is just a matter of time and mistakes and they're both inevitable Well it's going to make it tough for them and it's going to be a difficult transition I don't know how it's going to play out in terms of the particulars but I don't think that society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long Our physical and mental and spiritual health it's really very costly And as a society we are paying a staggering price for this My Right Uh-huh Yeah Yeah they're abusive of privileges Right Well this I think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten or twenty or thirty years will address Because I know this is addressed in Canada I have a good friend who is a physician practicing in Canada And they made the transition and I think that the for example the duplication of magnetic resonance imageries I've had one myself and they're wonderful technology but cities have three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need So I think that what the market place doesn't do because of the way the system has worked and it doesn't allocate resources oftenly because at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills but it's begun to change all of that The people paying the bills employers ultimately have begun to squawk because they have seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years So I think the evolution will be interesting Hawaii has a system that is apparently working and it will be interesting to see how much more attention we pay to that I do think though that it is inevitable primarily because of the pain that people are feeling under the circumstances I believe that it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care whether it's subsidized by the government and operated by private insurers I don't know I like that idea I tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances with the profit incentive work very very well we would be a lot better off if we contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste Well that's the problem with government administration of these programs and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with Government is going to have to change in this regard You know that is really a tough one for me to answer I would like to see the greatest improvement in management my field is the cognitive sciences and I recognize that a lot of these things that are done are done as a function of the operating systems in place And those operating systems have to change and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems and so a State or federal application could work it all depends upon the way you structure the environment We may have to deal with
