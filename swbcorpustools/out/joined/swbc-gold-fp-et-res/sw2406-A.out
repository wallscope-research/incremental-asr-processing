Uh-huh Uh-huh No no kids Was that the animated version Even better than ROGER RABBIT insofar as animation Yeah Yeah that was made I don't know several years back I guess latest one I've saw which was a mistake to go see was LIONHEART had Claude Van Damme of course I guess he's trained in this martial arts of some sort but the plot was bland the acting was bland It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to yeah chop them up exactly And Yeah Or he's singular I guess you know You know how they can make any single one of them in a movie to be a superstar of any sort you know but Chuck Norris of course could be just about equal if not more and all of them I guess could be in that fashion or category It was about a French Foreign Legion fellow who deserts to go help his brother's wife who became a widow because he was selling drugs and he got killed So he deserts and goes to New York and he starts out by fighting to make money and then he moves on to L A to where she is to just help him out the Hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something I don't know Well it was worth the buck I guess A lot of Uh-huh Yeah I absorbed all of that movie in one sitting I guess what made it so good was the cinematography Yeah and the music and well it had an excellent story line Everything about it was good I thought an excellent one too was MISERY with Kathy Bates and James Caan I'm not a James Caan fan but that was a well directed and acted movie I'd recommend it It's a little on the violent side but then what movie isn't anymore Well I have no objections to it It's just and it's a matter of your taste Yeah And even on those type they don't show what you expect Right Yeah that seems to be the norm of most movies but what the hey This is America Yeah Yes I have That was pretty good I always wait for the movie I don't have time to read the book Uh-huh Yeah They That's the magic of Hollywood special effects I hear this movie F X part two coming out is pretty good Did you ever see the original one It was you ought to rent the F X part one It doesn't say part one but it's F slash X A special effects man who somehow gets involved in this I'm not sure I can't remember It's been a while since I've seen it But he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody and he has to go underground and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done And Right and using makeup and using all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go But you need to rent the first one first if that is that the second one follows the first I don't know if they have the original actors on that first one to that one Oh I expected those they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there I think Uh-huh Actual names will not be used Eventually I'm sure they will come out with the proper names Latest story Uh-huh Kevin Costner I understand is supposed to be play Schwartzkopf supposedly I don't know That's just one of the many rumors that floats around Or what you read Pretty much used up the tape I guess Same And we'll Talk to you on the next go around Adios
