Okay what types of music do you like to listen to I like classical music also I like you I don't know a whole lot about it and I would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff but I'm not sure which composers or which I really like so I kind of hesitate to buy something There are certain kinds I like and certain kinds I don't Yeah Yeah I understand that no not really My husband is but I do the world a favor and I don't sing aloud to anybody but myself Yeah I don't care for rock at all I guess I'm real old fashioned in my musical tastes Yes Right Yeah Yeah I agree with that too Yeah now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the New Age and all that stuff Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Crops up every so often I listen to the Christian radio station when I'm in the car K L T Y I like to listen to some of that Yeah Uh-huh Yeah where do you live I thought maybe you lived in Dallas because that's the complaint I make to my husband about the radio station too I said they're playing one of their ten songs It seems like every week they pick ten and they just play them over and over Yeah Yeah Right My husband likes Sandy Patty songs He likes to sing those in church He'd buy all the sound tracts he could get his hands on typo tracks if he had the money to Well just an amateur singer He sings in the choir and he likes to do special music and stuff at church Yeah yeah I like to hear him sing <> He does a good job No not yet we're expecting a baby in July I guess we'll start listening Yeah maybe so We'll start listening to children's music Yeah there are Uh-huh  Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Yeah that sounds really cute I tell my husband to sing to my stomach because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they're still in the womb and I said then when it's born you can hold it and sing that again and maybe it'll comfort her you know when she's fussy and stuff What Huh How strange Uh-huh Babbly I'll say that is Well we'll have to keep up with that then Uh-huh Huh Right yeah have something to rebel against Yeah that's good yeah variety is good Well I guess that covers it It was real good talking to you Well thanks bye
