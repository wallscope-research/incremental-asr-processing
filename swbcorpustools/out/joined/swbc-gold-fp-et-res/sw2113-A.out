the last movie that I saw I don't go to that many so I'll just have to talk about the ones that I went to see but it was AWAKENINGS with Robin Williams and Peter DeNiro Have you seen it It is I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro He is one of the best actors I've ever seen It's there's a point where the show is about these catatonic type people that this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the living more or less but it wears off And the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic you know it starts off with like a tic and then it gets to where he can't you know control his movements at all And it was just so realistic The way you know you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor No it was very se- He's good he's talented boy he is I know me too But well what was that show Garf- I want to say Garfield but that wasn't it Yeah THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP He wasn't always funny in that show was he I did too That's why I was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part Yeah right Well what have you seen I saw it Yes the whole way Where did you cry Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah yeah I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed th- when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him And then the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards you know And that horse has been such a pal to him when he was alone You can tell I'm an animal lover you can hear my dog Yeah It was a beautiful story it really was Uh-huh uh-huh I thought it was awful and so graphic I hadn't even imagined it you know I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo I had a friend who had fixed some buffalo chili about a week before went to see the movie Of course they raise them now you know to eat But we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that No it wasn't yeah Yeah really And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this beaten down path and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing I know Yeah yeah have you seen any of the behind the scenes of that movie It was they tried to keep it you know as very close to real like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes and they had to teach a wolf how to howl That's the part they had trouble finding was wolves Yeah what they just don't howl that much anymore I could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off and that's all they'd have to do Yeah Well I think we've made it I don't know is it five or three I'm not either Okay me too Well thank you Yeah you too Bye bye
