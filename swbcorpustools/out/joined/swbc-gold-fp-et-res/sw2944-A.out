well I've had time to think about it because we've had i- i- there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to So I was thinking about a couple things and whether they are serious Some things are serious and some aren't I guess the biggest thing that bothers me is not the biggest thing but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information situation that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any sort of credit extensive checks and things of that nature When I don't know if that's an invasion of privacy simply I do feel it is but I don't know whether some of the questions they ask are legitimate because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your Uh-huh Well I guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact that once you give your social security number there are people I guess who are actually collecting all this all the time and profiles are given I understand I read the other day that these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone all they need now is your telephone number which I guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not I feel that is an invasion of privacy but it Yeah Yeah exactly Yeah My God Yeah Yeah I have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me well b- I make my living by flying airplanes for a company And as an airline pilot I have to take random drug testing it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time so when I finish a certain flight on a random basis I have to have a drug test and that's without probably cause and a- and in the end now they've spent forty million dollars and they've found I think in pilots anyway of something like eighty-six thousand tests there's only been three guys have come up positive and one of them was a bad test so Yeah Yeah Drug test righ- Yeah Yeah right Yes I am Yeah Yeah I can understand the public's alarm to it but I guess having done this all my life I knew that there wasn't a problem and indeed it has proved out that way but now try to get the damn thing repealed you know I guess I feel bad because not only that but in some of the instances like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints what happens if you say no If you say no then you're excluded and I doesn't seem the courts Yeah That's right It's my feeling also that although I don't know if it's that serious but that was part of the question I do feel the courts have held up a great deal of our privacy particularly look in some of the I notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy which I support of course but it I guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that it does seem that we've slipped and that's eroded or at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that you know it's fair game t- you have to answer these questions of course I don't know I feel there has been an erosion and I don't really know how serious it is except I don't like it   Uh-huh Yeah What was that yeah yeah yeah Right Well it just take that step where now we feel there's a need to do that and the next thing you know then there's always the need to go and inspect lockers of high school students tha- Yeah I guess so well good luck to you you just moved to Texas from Minneapolis I don't hold out much hope for you I think they'll be a cultural shock I was based there a lot several times in the service and I was absolutely flabbergasted at the in at least in criminal law some of the latitudes that the police had but Oh yeah Yeah  Yeah Well I don't understand if you don't if they don't make a criminal check why do you have to be fingerprinted I see the state doesn't require it Well that's rather unusual isn't it Well I guess the extension of that is why not the next thing you know we'll just stop a random amount of motorists and then if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street they do Yeah Well there's all sorts of scare tactics I guess to to invade our privacy and Yeah I just going to say NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR is come and gone but it's here And the computers of course helps that The computer abilities store that information
