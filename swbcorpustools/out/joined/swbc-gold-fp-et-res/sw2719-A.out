Do you exercise a lot Is mowing the lawn a new exercise my I think that's considered exercise whether you want it or not Well you are so far ahead of me I used to walk two miles a day and I really enjoyed it Because the two miles went fairly quickly I could do it in twenty-eight minutes And that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way but it's a lot You know It's not too strenuous and I could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything but I don't know what I did to my knee I was crawling under a desk hooking up a computer And I mashed it wrong or I did something And the doctor has had me on medication and she doesn't want me to walk she said that's you know while it's healing you're going to mess it up so I can't walk And she said you know the most conservative approach you do the medicine again and again before you think of surgery And I don't want her to think of surgery on my knee I don't want anyone to think about that ever That's that microscopic stuff you know uh-huh not my kneecap So I'm being very good But I miss it I really do and I really Uh-huh I can you understand that I don't really want to I just know I need to I make myself do it and if I do it okay I don't love it but I will do it it's not anything I would want to but I can really tell the difference since I have not been able to walk I have got to be so much more careful with what I do It's depressing Right Right boy hopefully my knee is a hundred percent better Maybe I can get back into it Let me ask you a question off the subject though you're living in the Castle Park area I grew up in Oak Cliff Yes I did just close to Methodist Hospital On Candy C a n d y in fact I lived there until late nineteen fifties And that area is it changing back again So many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them I know exactly where that is Yeah sure that's wonderful That is a gorgeous gorgeous place Well sure no slash listen they are  wow I need to go over there and just drive around and look I'm sure it must be I'm just we had a lovely little house over there it was like a two story Well story and a half really because we had a basement And the guy that built it was weird I mean weird It's one of these really creative houses that I grew up in that nothing was on the same level with anything else And I just loved the neighborhood And everyone had houses like that They were all completely different and so neat Oh Now why couldn't your wife run around the golf course Is that not good Yes I really hear that you know I think you know you're in Oak Cliff But I'm in Plano In west Plano And we live on one of those blocks that it's a neighborhood watch block We all know each other and the street doesn't go anywhere If you are on the street you better belong there Because it's not a through street And still I want to get up early in the morning and walk Before this knee business And my husband had a lot of heartburn with that it looked darker to him because he was in the house with the lights on When I was out walking it was more of a predawn type pretty but huh-huh he didn't think it looked predawn to him It looked dark And even he was real concerned about that So it's not just because you are in Oak Cliff it's just because you're smart That you don't do things like that That's right There's only one crazy out there you know to make any difference
