Okay Uh well yeah for the last uh couple of months Yeah Well it's kind of hard to say uh because I don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years We just bought uh a car uh last year and then bought one in eighty-nine and uh wait a minute we bought one in ninety We've got three cars of all things So uh probably we'll be in at least a midsize four door sedan Uh we have a a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater C R X Uh it's rather difficult to to project what kind of uh we'd look always look into uh consumer reports to see what kind of uh report or uh repair records that the various cars have and then of course we look into the prices And uh f- uh we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when when the cars could get to be discounted because we keep we've begun to keep them uh long- a longer period of time Uh I traded off an eighty-two Oldsmobile for the eighty-nine Mazda So uh Uh yeah yeah We we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life and uh we we've had a good many foreign cars And uh they they uh I've been extremely we've had three Mazdas We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas Yeah Yeah well we we've had uh let's see we had uh we had a uh let me think {pause} We had a fifty-three and a uh we had uh two fifty-threes which is a long thirty minute story Uh and we had a sixty-five and then we had this eighty-two So we we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles really Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well uh my son over in Shreveport uh sold Porsches Audis Mad- Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas Uh so uh the first foreign car that we had was a a seventy-seven M G M G B Was British gr- racing green with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top And uh I drove it mostly And Yeah it really was My husband was in the Air Force and we got transferred to Okinawa So uh we had to sell it W- which really tore me up Because uh it it w- it was great fun And then uh when we got to Okinawa well we bought a second hand we uh we decided that uh we had this uh sixty-five Oldsmobile and it and it was just too big so we we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States and we got a little Fiat uh and a and the little uh forty horse power Mazda four door sedan
