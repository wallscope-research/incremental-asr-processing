<> Yes Tell me what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up <> what is this Uh-huh I have two boys also my children are swimmers and so as they were growing up much of our normal life outside of school and everything revolved around their swimming So in order to have a reason for being there especially as they got older I became involved in it too so we were always together at their meets Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah the boys tried those but they did go in they started swimming when they were seven and eight and they really loved it and they're swimming both c- they'll be one is in college also swims in college and the other will continue to swim in college and they're fortunate they even made nationals And so we would drive up to see that whenever it was reasonably close but we did a lot of things and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children we live near Washington so we would always go in for the museums That's always a big thing And one of my children is also a musician so one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go either my husband or I or both of us would t- concerts with him And my other child is big into tropical fish so our whole family we take family trips to different places to visit or go to fish shows so I don't think we've missed a fish store on the entire northeast coast of the United States Uh-huh Yes In fact it's funny our vacations have always been as they've gotten older When they were younger we would go to the beach but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things and that there would be a feature each day Whether it would be going to one summer we went up to New England and we went to the marble quarries up there to see that and another day fish hatchery and so you know we did try and of course we learned too and I don't know I when they were very young I did not work Uh-huh And I started working part-time when they were in junior high school and high school now and I worked in the school system and now I work a full school day but that leaves me off on holidays and summers So it was a you know I think they need me more when they were older than they did when they were That's true yeah That's right yeah that's for sure That's for sure do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see Uh-huh Yeah when they you know it was funny I can remember and my mother and I have talked about it how important it was when I came home from school It wasn't really conversation but there were always things that just tumbled out And granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it but it when it's not there they miss it Uh-huh Yeah yeah No I realize that but it's funny they don't always do it but occasionally they do and you want and when they do there's a reason for it that they're sharing it and I've wanted to be available when for some reason they were bouncing something off of me Because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned about and it was you just felt gee if I weren't here how or if my husband That's right Yes that's exactly right but it's been interesting particularly I think because the society in which we live families are separated You don't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles I grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives Uh-huh Yeah yeah See and we're that I grew up with you know every weekend there was some visiting somewhere and it was sort of an Italian family but my children although we have some relatives in the area that we see we they don't ha- it's not that constant thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah And I just sort of think yeah that the trend of families and time where parents are spending less time you don't have the families to take up the gap And so the kids in some ways are suffering a little bit in that the family issues that get discussed and all these I think are very important parts of them growing up so we try to do it as well as we can We keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone and cousins and aunts and uncles and we do but although it's not the same we are and that's part of I think teaching too is what a family is like because then how do they pattern their own Yeah That's yeah Well we have had this tradition that we always go out before Christmas and cut our own tree And that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had Now this year it's was hard with our son now being in college So this was one thing that we weren't able to do this year but we did that from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until our older son went away to college And we have advent calendars still from the time that they came you know to Oh yes That's uh-huh Well ours is a friend of mine from Denmark hand appliqu3ed one for each child And they look today as new as they did when she gave them to us and there's a ring and you buy a present and you wrap the present up and the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of Band-Aids and an eraser and things today where sometimes I put a little gift occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save for their future to sometimes just money pieces of candy So I think as they're getting in college I just for my older boy that was in college I put a dollar bill for each day Which was the equivalent well it was the equivalent of a Christmas present and you know it was fun but that's a tradition and those will be passed on to them when they get married and leave Uh-huh Yes yes The b- yes and the broken families as I said living in an area of Washington D C We definitely see this and it's that grandmother figure not only raising her own children but raising children from the streets too frequently Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes well this is a si- this is in fact we've been studying this in our school that this is one of the symptoms or not the symptoms it's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing it's a rite of passage
