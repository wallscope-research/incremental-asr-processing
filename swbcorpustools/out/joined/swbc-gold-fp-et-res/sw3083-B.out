The biggest problem well like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that you know you can throw money at it but it's I don't know to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know because the general values that we're teaching kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school well the values more or less at home and the T V just a general learning is not a revered endeavor really it's a lot more it's well I won't say socially unacceptable but whereas like in a person that stud- they put a lot more emphasis on athletics and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society and I think that carries over to school a lot So Yeah Yeah yeah you know I wonder if that's a root problem or not because I think about that a lot and it's just like everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now but I wonder you know do you get the that's kind of side tracked but I just remember seeing on the news the other night they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much better I thought well you know of course they're doing better and not so much when I was growing up Catholic schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools but they still had a better success rate simply because they started with a lot better raw material everybody that went to a Catholic school at least the parents did at least had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it And I wonder if not so much that Yeah Yeah this is interesting because in my mind I don't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment but this was actually inner city people were sending just because their kids had the ability and the drive to try and get an education they didn't send him to a public school you know like you said you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance Yeah Yeah  and what would you do to fix the school systems Yeah Yeah Yeah That's what I was going to say It's the chicken and the egg thing I wonder a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools vandalism wise and you get it's been a while since I been in high school They're even in grade school when they do that But I can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that But you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything and take it out on the school Yeah
