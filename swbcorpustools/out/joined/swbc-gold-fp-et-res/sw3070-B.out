Does your family normally have a reunion Do you have one that's been Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Well it might be a good time for you to start a tradition You could be responsible for that yourself Sure Well in my family let's see last October was the forty fifth annual reunion The first Sunday in October the Jordan family gets together And all of the descendants of the Civil War veterans come together and they come as far away from California and there's usually between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people there's a big community hall in Vernon Texas and that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family Uh-huh Right uh-huh A lot of the older family lives in Vernon all of his direct descendants have now died and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties So we're talking about second and third great children here well I took them up until this year they're grown and gone from home now so they take their family But <> let's see that would make them grandfather great grandfather great great grandfather okay so it would be the second great grandchild <> And so they Well it's a community hall It's a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen it in and you just bring the covered dishes every family brings a dish of some kind and you get all the wonderful old family recipes that have been handed down for years Well we try to stay away from those things which might have salmonella in them And we choose to bring congealed salad You can bring a congealed vegetable salad as opposed to potato salad And most of us are very conscious of sanitation aspects whatever you've got to carry for any distance I always take home baked bread that happens to be my specialty for that family I do other things very well but there are others in the family who do them better Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Well it's we have kind of a core group that serves as quote officers of the organization and they plan the reunions the organize you know who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there who's going to rent the tables who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer and each year it's done a little bit differently because different people serve in those roles We have a biographer who continues every year to save clippings on any family member and they're entered into a wonderful scrap book And pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and and obituaries to those who are gone And it keeps the family alive you know even though it's very fluid And they're very dedicated to that and it's been really wonderful It helps you hang onto your roots And it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging My husband on the other hand was not very close to his family His family was very scattered and very diverse And I got to talking to him I said well how is his nephew doing "Well I don't know I haven't talked to my brother in three years" I said "Well how's your brother doing" "I don't know" you know my son keeps in touch with him I think but I don't I said "Hey wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people" "Yeah but I'm you know it's too much trouble" So I got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family And succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one to our place down at Lake Tawakoni Liked to kill me because I didn't have that group cooperation I did it by myself And nobody brought covered dishes We had a great big fish fry and you know I fixed a salad in a number three tub and it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping And we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and I told him We did it that year and then the following summer we did not have all of the family there We sent invitations We said "Please let us know if you're coming" It was when his step father had died the year before and it his mother was alone and so they came to support her and then one by one he began to lose family members and it was difficult to hold them together And then of course he died two years ago so you know that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now And it I think that's what happens when they get scattered the family unit you know falls into disrepair Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well see those people who are at that core group manage to keep the vigor alive They'll send out news bulletins Two or three times a year you'll get a news bull- hey guess who got you know elected to the legislature or guess who our local sheriff
