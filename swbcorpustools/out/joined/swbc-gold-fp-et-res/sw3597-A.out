do you see as the changes that have occurred in the last Beverly Huh yeah that's a big one Well I think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible for any of their actions Somebody else made them do it that's what I seem to see a lot of that no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices It's rather sue these guys because they made a seat belt that didn't work right or that's what I think is a big one Uh-huh Sure Yeah and another thing I think has changed quite a bit is the roles that men and women play That's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly Well both you know there's some great things that have come about with more equality but I think that also I don't know what's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that because I think that's bad for us Uh-huh Yeah I would agree with you
