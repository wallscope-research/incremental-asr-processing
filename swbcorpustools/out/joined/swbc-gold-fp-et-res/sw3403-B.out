Well I suppose I'm supposed to say the Rangers right Is that what I- is the million dollar question here Yeah you know I would like to say the Rangers but unfortunately they're not I was from Illinois and my favorite team was the White Sox No no my dad was but I turned out to be a White Sox fan I lived in Chicago Yeah they did pretty well What did you think of the World Series Uh-huh So you didn't really have a lot of choice did you Or country Yeah and I was routing for the Twins myself because a couple of Ranger players that I had watched when we first moved here went to Minnesota and we used to tease my son and I used to have a bet going about some of the players that had moved from here to Minnesota but it certainly was an exciting Series anyway What do you think going to happen to the Rangers Or can we predict Uh-huh Uh-huh No isn't it though You know but I think going to the ball park just really makes it Because then you watch it on T V you feel like you're more a part of it too Well I'm a great sports enthusiast so I love you know baseball teams and they in fact on the news tonight Nolan Ryan was on there he was put in which I never knew existed the Restaurant Hall of Fame The Restaurant Hall of Fame inducted him tonight and he says he's coming back you know he doesn't know how many years to pitch He'll be at least one more and he said he's been saying one more and it's been two and three might be two and three more He likes it Yeah That's right You know and he said I get a kick out of it you know he's such a nice man Yeah and he you know when he quits at being active he will go into you know managing and yeah you know being a coach I'm sure But he certainly is a good example for the kids You know you like to have someone like that you could point to say see what a fine man that he is That's right Uh-huh he's been a legend for so many years you know and I don't know had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at U T with his son His son pitched for U T and he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers Yeah it was a I think it was a little early part of the summer and Nolan against Ryan against Ryan yeah his son pitched for U T and only Ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing A game is a game you know Well the Rangers really knocked the socks off of them which you would expect you know anyway but Nolan I think took himself out after a couple of innings or something you know of the game so
