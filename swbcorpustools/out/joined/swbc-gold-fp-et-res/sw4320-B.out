So how serious is the subject of crime in your area Jeez Well luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime but it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the outlying agricultural towns because you end up having a lot of gangs forming largely around the Hispanic core it seems to be that gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well that's efficient They're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort Wow Yeah yeah I'd heard that phrase Uh-huh Yeah there aren't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays Uh-huh Well there's a couple of things that I've heard most of them are fairly radical in terms of what you'd have to do course the reason that these kids tend to turn toward the drugs and everything else seems to be just you know the end results of poverty and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else because you know the parents aren't making a living at anything  And they're accidental parents half the time anyway It's illegal but it's not wrong because all their friends do it Yeah Well I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of an actual solution to the problem the other social problems wouldn't go away  there's been a lot of and I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus but then the more I thought about it the more sense it made is that alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow
