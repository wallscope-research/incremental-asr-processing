You want to go first Yeah like should the government make it universal or something like that Yeah Uh-huh you would be in favor of it Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Do they have options on you know like choices of doctors and that type of thing Do you Uh-huh Uh-huh That's the way with me I don't know a whole lot about it I woul- that's the only concern I would have because I think personalities plus the type of doctor it is has a lot to do with the care and if you didn't have any choice you know in who you go to Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Or to change even like if you didn't approve or didn't think you were getting good service Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh There that's one of my main concerns I have a friend that their boy has been sick for several months and they just have found out what's the trouble And they have gone through one two three four five doctors and then a team of doctors and they finally determined what the problem was It took that long And that something like that you know I thought if you couldn't change or look elsewhere you know for help I don't know how that program works you know if you can do that Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh I guess that's primarily was one of my thoughts you know because you know how government is Uh-huh For them to have a choice on if they're in favor of it or not it would Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I know where my son works they have an option right now where they can have their own physician or they can choose one that their company has elected and that costs them less if they take the doctor that the company has selected He ge- Well only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense Otherwise you know he has to take the physician and the hospital that the company has chosen as you know the one they have taken And there again he's gotten good service He took the less expensive one of course Uh-huh uh-huh  Right right Yeah cause that's the first I've really known anybody that you know works for somebody that they had that option you know to make the choice of what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take Uh-huh uh-huh If you have your health you're wealthy You really are yeah yeah we live in a rural area up here are you familiar with any of the area that all Where well that's a ways away But we live in Clarion County we have a cousin that lives in Philadelphia and Yes uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh That's a nice state that's a real nice state uh-huh uh-huh So I suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in you know like more populated areas as far as the doctors that are available <> Of course we have good physicians here too we've been pretty fortunate We've had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area for some of the different fields So we've been pretty fortunate Uh-huh yeah yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh It sure is I still wish they could do more with the cancer situation though they just don't seem to be I know they're making progress but not like that I would like to see yeah Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh But a lot of them don't do these things even and it doesn't seem to matter So it rea- Well they say second hand smoke and that is worse than smoking so what do you do you know Yeah yeah Take their rights away from them they say I never had the desire so I haven't ever had that problem as far as that goes So I can't take any credit for not smoking even So It's hard to break it's a hard one to quit Yeah yeah Yes very nice talking to you too and you have a good day Right Okay bye-bye
