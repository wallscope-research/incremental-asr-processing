yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I'm currently in school so I've had an I B M clone I guess for a couple of years now which I've been trying continually upgrading I guess And I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it and I can't really I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer simulation or analysis so it's very essential for me Schools have them but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school it's much more convenient to have one at home At Georgia Tech Yeah so Yes actually Yeah it sure I have some games of course which I play on there and I have a program which allows me to access a weather data bank so I can like check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby So it provides other means other than just strict you know computations and so on so do you have a computer for yourself at home yeah Yeah Tha- Uh-huh Yeah yeah Do you use Email and like that Yeah It's I have modem night computer so I can log into the network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which can be useful But yeah that and word processing is while I tend to obviously I do almost all of my report writing on my computer whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments So it's I don't know really become my mainstay I guess I can't even remember actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report Because my family when I was growing up we got a basic computer T R S Eighty when they first came out And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high so yeah Oh Yeah It must have been tough It's a little bit strange for me I did my Master's thesis last year and I did that on a computer and it seems like I just can't imagine how people did it before It must have been just so much work Yeah so you used your son's Macintosh then do you like that kind of computer Uh-huh Yeah Huh Yeah Yeah Well if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge
