A Ford Explorer A Ford Explorer Yeah one of the new ones And I'd probably buy another this is the first American vehicle I've owned So I would probably purchase another one I would be more selective in the dealership that I purchased it from but as far as the quality seems to be there it's quiet it handles well but I believe I'd get that or a Porsche one of the two No not And why would that be What's wrong with the Volvo Oh what city are you calling from Oh Up in Dallas  B M W or Mercedes yeah well that's a Uh-huh What do you presently drive fun Well there nothing wrong with those they're nice vehicles nothing wrong with those it's just everybody has their own taste but man the Mercedes are expensive My wife has a Volvo and it's nice you know it's okay Huh no no no no no no no it it I kind of wish we would have maybe gone for the G L rather than the D L but because it is the safest car on the road  slash error  yeah slash error  Yeah there just safe to just that's the reason why we mainly got it We got white and it's the safest four door you know if you have a family which we do we just one out and so it's you know they're kind of low to the ground after driving the Explorer You know I presently I used to have a two eighty Z and I'm a tall guy and they're hard to get around in traffic to see Because you can't see a car ahead of you but they're fast as lightning and all that crap But the Explorer you're sitting up on top of everything and you can really see real well And I just it's so comfortable and  I'd call this an incomplete slash unit  So you're what are your feelings about American versus European cars Why not That's the way it goes I guess Yeah I was real hesitant but it was I don't know I think European cars are great course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff and they're eas- some of them are easy to work on A Volvo being a four cylinder is very easy to work on excellent warranty just unbelievable warranty and of course Ford isn't too bad I think Chrysler would probably make a good vehicle but all of it has to do in my opinion with the service and the attitude of the service of the dealership I wouldn't send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford There's Middlekauff Ford in Plano Their just their attitude is just slimy and I've written a letter to Middlekauff and I've told them that matter of fact I got another letter last night from the Quality Ford Division their still concerned about my attitude spelling "their" should be "they're and it will never change about that place And but anyway that's my own personal comment I guess but Middlekauff wouldn't She needs to find herself a lawyer she'd come out like a champ on that one So have you been using well anyway That was I was asking you some questions about the telephone and how many have you been doing but that's they don't want to hear that Is that all A week Good Lord I think I started in January or February God I've I'm like twenty some phone calls That's why I wasn't sure if this was the second time around or what Well look I've enjoyed speaking with you And keep smiling Bye bye
