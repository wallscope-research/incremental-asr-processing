Well this is the season for vacations And I guess for places I like to go I enjoy going to the beach and being outdoors somewhere Someplace that's very different than Texas And I maybe as the summer heat comes along I would sort of like going somewhere where it's not so hot And being able to be outside enjoy outside activities so Enjoy going places where I enjoy playing tennis so I like to have a tennis court there or if it's at the beach the beach is great A pool is great And I well let's see we have plans this year to drive up to the to Colorado And we will be going to Estes Park and Colorado Springs so One year we went to the southwest corner of Colorado into Durango and north of the area there And I boy that's a nice place to visit It's really nice at there's a nice train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining and then actually north of that is another town on a smaller scale I guess than Silverton I and then there's lots and lots of mountains that are covered with boulders So I guess people Jeep through that area and we did not have a chance to do that But I sure would like to go back there and do that again I have not been but I have heard it's wonderful Right Right and the beach is nice the beach is really nice isn't it Oh Sea shells Sea shells Yeah where do you stay My husband always wants to go to Destin we just have not gone that direction yet Okay Right That's nice Great nice Oh Great Oh Well we have just Are you driving Oh Well we are the neighborhood that we live they are switching to an alternate calendar this year so it well starting at the end of July we will have two vacation weeks in October and two vacation weeks in March So that will be an interesting turn on vacations for our family So I Well it's what it truly is supposed to mean is nine weeks of school three weeks of vacation nine weeks of school three weeks of vacation and in the summer would be more like a two month break and they hope to boost the learning of the children Just the retention of the material for them So Yeah yeah So it's anyway so maybe within a year we will see how that falls we will head for Florida maybe in somewhat of an off season instead of summer So Well that's probably all we need to do today Alright Thanks a lot
