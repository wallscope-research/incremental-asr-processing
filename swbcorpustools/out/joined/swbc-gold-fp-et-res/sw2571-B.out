there was a crime here in McKinney a rather heinous murder There was no remorse shown by at least one of the perpetrators And yet for whatever reason his crime was not considered a capital crime and quite honestly I feel very strongly that the man has no redeeming social values and if and when he gets free again he will have no compunction but to continue that same kind of lifestyle and perhaps do the same thing again So it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever that's right But yeah Did you Uh-huh Yes but my concern is first of all that not all persons who I think should be receiving whatever capital th- punishment thank you I just got home from work and I'm just kind of spaced out a little bit that not all of them are being convicted of it that they're not even being charged with that appropr- I agree with you that a person's heart can be changed but the same God that can work that miracle also established the laws that said for certain kinds of <> sin certain kinds of breaking of the law there would be a capital punishment Right then it was almost immediate As soon as the trial was over then it was stoning We don't have a speedy trial we don't have speedy punishment and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth That's correct Uh-huh I tend to agree on that very strongly Plus all the judicial system is overloaded with all kinds of problems and crimes and so forth and then all of the civil things that clog the courts and having sat on both criminal and a civil jury some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time Because we're suit happy but back to the capital situation sounds like you and I have a lot of common ground at least as far as capital punishment is concerned I would like to see some kind of streamlining so that if a person is convicted and sentenced to death that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family any of us the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years bu- him could be a her But  That's sad Yeah However certain very liberal minded groups who do not subscribe to the same ethical system that you and I do such as the civil liberties unions and so forth will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath Which is most unfortunate because we all lose out when people go so far out to the extreme on either side Because too often they're can be extremism that hurts from any direction regardless of whatever you're arguing or concerned about Yeah
