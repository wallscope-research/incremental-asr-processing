All righty well I have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year so I'm really just starting to get involved in what's out there and how they do things as far as the system as a whole I really don't see a problem with it I do see a problem with graduating people that can't read and are not you know productive in society or productive to themselves and I think that's the main problem at this point How about yourself Uh-huh Right Uh-huh That's true Uh-huh Yeah I think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that you know special interest groups can blow up and not really get down to teaching what's important Teaching these kids you know really the basics is what it comes down to Is that right  I remember And talk yeah  Yeah then it comes down to what you said before though about them being some of the lowest paid you know public service employees that there are and yet they're so important Uh-huh Right Well you know it's hard though because then you start talking taxes and that's a bad word There's an idea Run on that then no income taxes in Texas I'm in Texas too so Well me too I think we both agree there's some problems there but we'll maybe do our small part to fix them up All right you too Bye
