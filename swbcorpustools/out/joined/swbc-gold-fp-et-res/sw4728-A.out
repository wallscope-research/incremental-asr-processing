I have a Ford pickup and the family car is a Dodge Caravan because we have three kids and they're under thirteen so they sort of fit our requirement Yeah I have one of those pickups with a seat in the back And so they just fit in there When they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work right now I can throw them all in the back when we have room and since I do a lot of projects I throw things in the back and I kind of like having a pickup truck Actually I think of it as a car that'll last I like the way trucks are built and I don't care about comfort So I'm pretty happy So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one I never buy new so I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck And yeah I don't need to pay for the glitz I'll let somebody else have the showroom shine and I'll pay for the rest of it Right And the van we're sor- we might go again on a van we could probably do with something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time I'm not sure we'll have to face it in a couple of years but I guess we had a small Toyota wagon and we were real happy with that because my second requirement after price is low maintenance And it certainly had that We didn't do much to it at all So Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-oh How at how many miles Huh You didn't overheat it Uh-huh Huh Well that was Uh-huh Yeah I have one colleague that commutes to work on one when it's not raining and he's a it's he's pretty conservative guy I don't think it's much of a sport for him I guess I'm sure he does yeah No Yeah  Yeah Right If I only had some place that I could store the camper top I would have it off most of the time I really leave it on there just just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty But they're solid trucks are built They're the only things Americans still know how to build and Yeah Right I kind of like mine yeah so mine's a Ford I heard about that yes Yeah that's a serious truck Right this I know a contractor who just got one of those He's pleased with it
