Well I'm pretty pro gun control over all I've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control and I must say that there are a couple of arguments against strong gun control which I find very compelling although most the people who argue gun control with me I find use sort of canned arguments you know sort of the N R A slogan arguments and see I've been very frustrated when I do debate with people about it I guess on a scale of one of ten I'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns and I have to admit most of that is strong personal distaste I don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort and guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me Uh-huh I'll give it a try I've got my Texan stereotypes in place Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh It's pretty power isn't it Okay Okay Uh-huh That applies to anything as well as guns a gun Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh What I don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it wouldn't you don't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way I would hope because someone the personal sheriff doesn't get to have a gun and someone the personal sheriff Yeah But if you're not a basically good citizen you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway So why hav- So why have any restrictions at all Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Well we could be Well that makes a lot of since to me I certainly feel that if we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm but I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so Yeah Well I have a bicycle and that scares me too to tell you the truth because I've been run off the road and all sorts of things Well I'm still puzzled though what is the argument how does the argument work if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway What's the point of putting a restrictio- basically the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway they're not going to take those courses is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns If it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices does that mean advantage Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh no Bay area San Francisco Bay area Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh What if you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon I Yeah Well I'm sure I'm sure given all your training I'm sure that you know you'd if I walk into a bad neighborhood I'm sure I'd want to walk through with you because I'm sure you have far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything I'm quite concerned that if you let everyone hasn't yet committed a felony if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature You're going to start getting a lot of gunfire it's hard for me to imagine that a situation of you know take it to a logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying a guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I know No I understand that what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake Yeah Well that was the topic Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well as someone who would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander I feel more comfortable with people having blades because you're not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly and
