Why don't you go ahead and start Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah for a while I haven't gotten any because I just find that I'm not reading what I'm getting because I have so much going on in my life that seems to be the last thing I pick up so I found that I was wasting my money As much as I enjoy them when I do subscribe I've gotten in the past the PARENTS magazine and the HOUSEKEEPING magazine  Yes yeah Yeah yeah Right well I found that after a couple of years of having a PARENTS magazine it was getting repetitious so I kind of canceled it anyway for that reason the HOUSEKEEPING magazines I do like because like you say they have nice recipes in them and ideas but lately they've just been piling up on me so I figured it wasn't something I needed at this point in time I don't know I well my husband would love to have more Now he's the type who will get the INC magazine and MONEY magazine and all the financial type magazines Yeah Uh-huh yes Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well yeah and some of those have had what I consider or what I get the idea that they are maybe the more pricier type magazines as far as women's magazines They seem just to be so chocked full of ads Uh-huh Yeah yeah Yes Right Yes Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Yes I enjoy books a lot more that's true Well now I have certainly stopped subscribing as much as I used to other than my children have gotten You know they get tons of magazines it seems they're always getting something in the mail so between reading to them and reading the newspaper and then I have a book that I'm occasionally reading when I get a chance but I just don't get a chance for those newsy magazines the ones that are full of ads unless you just want to skim through while you're I read them when I'm at a doctor's office or you know waiting on something like that Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh That's true that kind of is a good way to do it Yeah yeah Okay
