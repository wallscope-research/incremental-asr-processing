Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh So you like a variety Sort of easy listening because you like country but then  uh-huh Yeah I like some of his songs though they're not so sad country all the time They're just kind of sweet sometimes You know they're not the typical country where they're just you know my wife left me my dog left me you know Yeah my truck's broken down and my house just burned down you know But No Uh-huh do you play the piano is or you just like it Yeah Yeah it must be fun to be able to play it and you know if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be kind of fun I think because I play the flute and not many things you can play you know people will sit there and sing along to and you can't sing along either but I like a lot I like classical music just because of the when I don't play I like jazz music but What's that What's that Yeah I like a lot like I like is it the New Age music like with the I don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection Yeah I love those too They're just so relaxing Yeah Yeah Isn't that nice it's nice when you have a piece that is so peaceful that everybody likes you know and you know it has pieces that are uplifting but it's mostly relaxing and because it doesn't have words you know you don't feel like there's anything you have to remember you know as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean but Yeah Yeah Yeah I see what you're saying Yeah I can't identify them either I just like them I know which ones come next but I don't even know their names Most of them I don't know their names of the song but I can identify them But I like that and course I like classical music And I was in the band yeah and I was in like chamber music groups and stuff so I'm used to pieces and I played classical flute I didn't play jazz flute or anything like that so I can relate to it I suppose and I'm like you I like the older stuff too because I like Chicago and I like let me think who I like Hebert listen; two utts you don't know Hebert Laws but Hebert Laws a flute player he's a jazz flute player and I like Chuck Mangione do you know who Chuck Mangione is Yeah I like Chuck Mangione Trying to think of all what's his name plays the trumpet slash error Yeah Yeah I like Moody Blues I like mostly the older groups I think c- but we do have I like Simply Red we got Simply Red I figure all our C Ds that we have what I really like And I like Breeze I like the group I think just because  they all sort of sound + they sound a lot like Simply Red If I'm going to listen to that kind of music nowadays it's easy listening slash error No it's got people singing but it is instrumental But it's got people singing but it's got like a whole bunch of people singing You know how many people are in Simply Red Stuart <> <> he can't hear me I don't remember how many people but it's got men and women and it's nice I mean it's pleasant you know music It's not where it hurts your ears to hear it But it's not like Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it You know it doesn't have like all the brass and everything Yeah you must live in this area We're in Sherman okay You're going to Commerce For East Texas or something okay okay Well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas That's why I was just w- Yeah East Texas is recruiting for you know their fall semester and they've been doing a lot of that in the area No more Well right now I'm just a homemaker but I'm going to school for legal assistant and that's what I know and just nothing basically No no it no I don't go to East Texas I got a degree from T W U but I'm really interested you know in the legal environment but I don't want to be a lawyer so I said well I think I'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant uh-huh Yeah Yeah that's how it works And this is the man that was in front of you well they'll weed him out Yeah Uh-huh Well not necessarily but there's probably something else that might make you Because you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for the jury pretty much a lot of people would know about it you know and know some of the different things about it but they might weed you out some other way You know if you don't believe in death penalty you're not going to be picked at all but Yeah so see there they would have a doubt about you that you know because if that's what the punishment is in that instance then you're always going to say you know not gui- you're not going to want to have him have that punishment So Uh-huh Well especially with something where you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt You have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it's like do you really feel that sure about
