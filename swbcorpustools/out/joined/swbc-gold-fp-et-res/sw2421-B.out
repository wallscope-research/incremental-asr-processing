Well I guess I'm more concerned about public safety than I am about the concern for the private the idea of preserving privacy for the individual because I can't really see why anyone who has nothing to hide would object of course that is certainly true yeah Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Sure If you had to have a drug test Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Checked out or whatever But it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that I agree that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test but I would think that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that For example that one positive would not be accepted as an automatic reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive dismissal or treatment or whatever but that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps one or two more stages where further tests could be done Because there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with false positives for certain kind of drugs On the other hand I think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested because of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in industries well the transportation industry you know specifically But in many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs it's not even going to effect anybody but you know himself and his own family perhaps depending on the kind of drug he might be on But and eventually that's going to show up anyway in the way he works and so on But there's so many things that it would make a difference I guess I would not want to have anyone in my family victimized by you know a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that who you know hadn't been tested Yeah Yeah Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Make it difficult enough Yeah yeah Yeah according to what you hear The people who have serious problems we have really I guess we're kind of lucky We really only know of one young man who's a fam- they go to our church and it's the son and so on and he was friends with my children and he's really the only one that I know of personally who got himself really messed up having been involved with drugs But I know of a number of other people who have you know gotten all messed up Most of these are young people I work in the education system and so I have a little more contact with that But the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking and he may never really be a productive member of society But sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are almost uncontrollable he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that you know he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not you know he's so messed up And this was a nice sweet young man who teenager you know and he's now a young man about twenty I guess who just got really down the wrong path And you know I don't know that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing But seeing what drugs did to him makes me realize what it could do to people you know in the work force as well it's horrible Well the limits would I think have to do with what I'd alluded to before that one positive on a drug test would not constitute dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might have set up for those who genuinely have a problem In other words there needs to be more than Pard- yes right there needs to be more than one test and there needs to be some measure of certainty before anything drastic happens There are lots of things that are involved there such as perhaps you know denial of insurance for someone and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this that you know it would be unfair and people who are on medication for example or even people who might be of the gay community and I'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society but I think that there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination because it makes a bigger problem so it seems to me that there needs to be you know some rules that protect I'm not sure though when we talk about what rules if any that we should say well certain segments should not have to be tested I really don't see why And yeah Yeah I don't know why it would be you know bad to test just every- and it may be you know it's not feasible to do everyone but certainly random testing the fact that people know that they Yeah would be some measure of protection But the bottom line is that if you're going to stay clean and straight then you're going to do that because you want to Really Yeah That's very true Well it sounds like we agree anyway Yeah I guess if that's all we've done and I guess we've talked long enough It was nice talking to you Okay bye-bye
