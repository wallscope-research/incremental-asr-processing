All right you have pets I understand a couple of them What are they Pets get like that don't they they think they own you Okay these are cats I remember one time I used to get a chuckle out of Pogo That dates me quite a bit you probably don't know po- Yeah i- when Beauregard was talking he was the dog remember and he used to say pets can be most as much trouble as kids if they work at it a little bit and even more when they work at it a little bit And I think that's true act- uh-huh Th- just good company that's neat it's funny how pets get to be so you really do mourn them after when things happen Now we don't actually have a pet right now but we have had some and I it's always hard for me to believe how close I've gotten to them We had a little dog it was a little I got it so it wouldn't shed one of these French Poodle a little French Poodle Yeah and I used to come down stairs in the morning to feed him you know and I'd let him up out of the basement where he was sleeping and he would just dance around the floor and I just got and we only had him about three or four weeks before he was hit by a car but I cannot believe he just got in to us so quickly I could not believe it I have to tell you about our most interesting pet though we had an iguana living with us for about two and a half years I guess It was about three feet long It was a beautiful animal name was Clyde Clyde the iguana And my son Dan went to Hawaii for the summer and when he came home he didn't bring the iguana with him but for some reason or other he had a thing for them I don't know whether he'd I think there was one in the school zoology department you know or biology department one or the other anyway and anyway he went and found this guy in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one in Mexico I don't know where But anyway he brought this home and I looked at him and I said you've got to be kidding I'm not going to live with a lizard But you know I visualize that animal racing about and you know like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that They're very much like well the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes No he had full run of the house He just loved to sit on the back of my dryer where the heat came up out of the dryer you know he was really a neat pet and though I you know he'd ri- when we'd have family home evening and everybody would sit in the living room and the fire would be burning he'd walk across my feet sometimes And it was a long time before I could really pet him but I fed him and he knew how to get me to feed him He'd come out to the kitchen just kind of look at me until I went and got him something out of the refrigerator But he was really a neat animal he'd lay in Dan's lap you know and just when he'd pet him he'd just stretch and you know you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does It was kind of interesting But he did a lot of interesting things and Dan carried him around and he liked to ride on the back up on his head you know with his tail wrapped around his arm so he wouldn't fall off and scare everybody to death and kids loved him kids just loved him Kids just came from all over to come and see Clyde and visit with him and he tolerated them you know He'd even tolerate him petting though he didn't like them too well at first but he got tame you know so people could go in there And Dan was a drummer and the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming When Dan would drum he'd sit there and scrunch up you know like he was trying to protect himself <> and then he'd leave the room yeah they're interesting well they take on human characteristics like our other animal the next year our son Ken went to Hawaii and well while Dan was in Hawaii Ken decided he wanted a dog and he looked around a long while and he found a Norwegian elkhound and he just brought this Norwegian elkhound an home and he was so funny for a while they built a run for him out to the side of the house you know He'd been on the patio but they put the run out there and he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by and sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him And one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him and Hal + and I were in bed and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air And then bark and march around you know and then he'd pick up his dish again and throw it in the air until we came out and gave him some water Did what No he didn't eat flies No they eat greens we fed him the outside leaves of lettuce you know I'd get lettuce at the store and he'd eat the outside leaves And then in the summertime you could put him out and he'd eat outside except you had to keep him away from the garden because he liked to eat the little peas as fast as they came up you know it was s really a of things that were fresh sprigs you know he liked that Well yeah when Dan went up to college up at Ricksun Idaho he took him with him and everybody was used to him and they just loved him and what not and his roommate put him out one day and Dan didn't know it and it got dark and he didn't get him in again And they searched and searched and searched for him but it got too cold up there and he died in a tree they found him the next day in a tree but So you have to be pretty tender with them he had his own heat lamp and hot pad he laid on you know That was another funny thing he had a hot pad and it burned up one time and boy that was funny too watching him kind of burned up but anyway An we got him a new one he had a blue one before and when we got him a new one it was brown and he wouldn't lay on it until we changed the covers No he wouldn't lay on it Bu- so they really pick up things he was a clean animal he went to the bathroom in the bathroom well we put some papers on the floor underneath the john and he went there to go to the bathroom You had to be sure you left the doors open you know he didn't like to go anywhere else he'd scratch and do all kinds of things to get you to open the door if you happened to close it on him or something you know but even when he had an accident or something if you just let it dry it dries kind of like especially when he was inside and just eating lettuce it dried up a little bit like ashes and you could just vacuum it up In the winter time there was no odor at all to it And in the summertime when he was outside and eating outside the smell was a little bit like a cat you know But Yeah he was a really interesting animal we just really and you know to this day I still miss him and that's been years ago Yeah he was just Yeah yeah I think I guess so But it was interesting Well what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you pet them Yeah and you just kind of took them over Uh-huh uh-huh A little bit easier to have cats in this kind of country though isn't it We- I think Yeah that could be pretty ones Newhart Yeah ye-
