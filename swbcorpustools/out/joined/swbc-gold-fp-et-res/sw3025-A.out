Okay I do a fair amount of cooking and I love having guests to dinner I probably do that about once a month And I usually prepare something depending upon the guests you know I like to prepare chicken that seems to please everybody pasta or a casserole How about you   Uh-huh Well that's about the way I prepare most fish I made scallops the other night that was unusual and basically I found a recipe to make it in the microwave and you swished around a little melted butter and microwaved them for about nine minutes No no four and a half to five minutes and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top very simple but very nice So if you are looking for a French recipe that was good Sesame seeds and bread crumbs And my husband liked it And no unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive fish items But you know I look for them to go on sale at the grocery store one of the things I love to do eat out How about you Do you have any particular places you like going Uh-huh Yes I have been there And it's kind of like Black Eye Pea but I do not think it's a chain Oh yeah Yeah I do not feel like they are very healthy and I always feel like the home cooking places are the healthiest meals You know I tend to have chicken fried steak when I go to them how was it  Uh-huh Yeah I get teased by my family a lot because I like experimenting on food and sometimes I go for fairly exotic things And my father teases me about gourmet cooking Which is not always true and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else is that some of the experiments fail the last time we had some friends over for dinner I tried a dessert that sounded wonderful in the recipe and it was just a total bust I was sorry I did not have ice cream to fall back on my that's ambitious  Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh see I am not that's interesting One of the things I do not make is dessert And my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation because you know we have ice cream or something like that And that's why when I did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago it was just a total fiasco everything else was fine but that was a fiasco yeah Yeah And I also don't have much of a sweet tooth so I can live without dessert for the most part Yeah do you cook for yourself or do you cook for others Yeah Well when I was single I think my favorite meal was a baked potato And yeah yeah And I never put anything other than a little butter on it or if I had a little cheddar cheese sometimes I would grate that up And it's amazingly satisfying Yeah I did not say it was nourishing but it was satisfying And Yeah yeah but you know I never really enjoyed cooking for myself so I ate very simply And I think that's one reason I like having people over because I could try things I must be a frustrated chemist or something like that Cause cooking is a little bit like being in a chemistry lab And Yes and have an explosion Sometimes it blows up anyway I once had an old boy friend over to dinner when I was recently staying with my parents And I had this wonderful recipe and you were supposed to make a toffee like substance for a pie by boiling evaporated milk three hours and it does turn to toffee inside the can And the only problem was when I opened the can it just flew all over the place It was on the ceiling on the walls and me and the boy friend thought he was supposed to be there at six o'clock not seven o'clock so just at the time all this happened the door bell rang and there he was And I had to have my dad sort of entertain him for awhile while my mother and I scrambled to clean everything up I really do not remember that was about ten years ago I just remember how embarrassing it was And I have made it since and several times before and I never had that problem just that one time And he was a gourmet cook he was kind of pushy too Acted like he came from San Francisco and he had a very sophisticated taste I really wanted to impress the heck out of him and well it was a memorable evening anyway as far as I do enjoy cooking so I was awfully glad I was given this
