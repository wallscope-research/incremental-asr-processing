tell me some about your camping experiences Carolyn Okay where do you go camping at around here Okay Sure what activities do you do when you're camping Uh-huh Well that sounds like fun I grew up in South Dakota up in the Black Hills and so we used to go camping my dad would take us there was four of us kids he'd take us and we'd all go camping my dad and my mom and the kids and it was always fun because what I always remember is my dad would let us pick our camp spot and he'd always tell us you know okay look for you know a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents and it always had to be somewhere near a river so we could go fishing and hopefully we'd catch our supper but we never did but it was always fun We'd always Mom was always prepared and she'd bring along you know something because tradition had it we would never catch anything so we always had something along to eat but then we'd roast marshmallows and it was always an enjoyable experience about nineteen eighty-two I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills I crossed the state to Aberdeen and there's no hills it's flat and then I was in high school and couple of my high school friends and I we'd go camping out by a river of course and go fishing but by then of course I was able to catch some things but it was always fun It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river you know in the hills we would do like you folks did would take the nature hikes you know and look for animals and we always you know in the hills you can see quite a few different animals but Go ahead Okay Sure Now are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area Okay Uh-huh I Right the one in Tyler has it been pretty commercialized I suppose Okay helps keep the pests out I suppose Well that sounds I don't know if I can rate camping but you know it sure beats driving a thousand miles to find a mountain I guess No we just moved down in June Yeah I'm still trying to find my way around if I can get on Central from anywhere I'm happy Okay
