Yeah I think this is a tough subject because when you come from two different parts of the country the political views are really different I guess I've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues I guess nothing is as awful as abortion but like gun control and day care an things like that and there are some very different views of the people connected with the program which I thought was really interesting you know Yeah well being in Baltimore see Maryland is prob- a hub of liberalism you know compared to the country you know in many ways very liberal very somewhat to New England though Pennsylvania and New York aren't actually as liberal Maryland is a very liberal state so so here  we have we have  gun control laws we probably have some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation and most people in Maryland vote for that you know So it really is a different Yeah that's right talk to I had to talk about gun control with somebody and I talked with a woman who actually you know had just purchased a gun that day and was going target shooting you know and it was very different it was a whole different view this has opened my eyes to thinking you know at one time I just sat here and thought well how can anybody believe that because I'd really never met people that did and now I talk to people that do So it's really interesting Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah isn't it funny Uh-huh  Yeah Yeah well you can possess 'em here too but they're registered and like the Brady Bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here in gun control avenues and You have the seven day waiting period Yeah that's Yeah Yeah that's true that's very true and that's the way I guess most of the political organizations work you know the same I know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose and both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know there's there's always that difficulty I would say I'm probably liberal yeah yeah Sure Well I'll tell you I think you know if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag it would never happen do you know what I mean It's only because they make a big stink over it But I guess actually I believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag I guess that's their opportunity they're right in the sense of freedom of speech But I would never Yeah Yeah Well it's free- that they I think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and the whole aspect of being able to display your ideas you know what America stands on is that they can do that though I would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself I think you know but I still what the flag stands for I guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed  unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know but that's my opinion Yeah I guess you feel differently no but I think that's taxpayer's money If somebody buys their own flag and burns it that's fine but you know that's destruction of public property and whatever No I don't know I guess the symbolism I think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government I think that's what's made democracy Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well that's true Yeah But I think I g- Yeah I guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers one of the appointees for the judicial bench and they always talk about they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution the ideals the original framers set down And I believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in my understanding of how it was framed is that the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government and you can display that I + Yeah I g- and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever I think that that's viable as long as it's your flag and you've made your point I think Yeah Because realistically like you don't think it's right And I would never do it I love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me But I guess it's just one of those things where it's a need for them you know Yeah Yes No Right Yeah Uh huh Uh huh Yeah I agree there too I agree with you there too I find it you know personally disgusting But I don't think that we have a right to stop somebody from that you know the same I don't know I guess I get all mixed up inside  when +  Yeah it g- +  when  it's an emotional issue and you sit and you try and think about it logically and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing but logically even you know for instance the pro life pro choice movement you know I don't know anybody that actually supports abortion but they would vote pro choice because you know That's just a disgusting thing you know somebody an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing you know but Yeah but that's what I mean see mo- but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing and it evokes an emotional response I think that's the hardest thing I don't know if I could ever be a judge because some things emotionally just aren't you know No no I think the sometimes I guess what did I read recently the Christian point is always the point of well it's at conception but then a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term And there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then So it's I don't know it's a topsy-turvy world and it's really something how political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within a Yeah and  how + Yeah how  it'll sway from one extreme to another I think that you know I just read something I think in TIME magazine about protest
