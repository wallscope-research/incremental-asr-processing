Whoa Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Where do you work Oh Uh-huh Right Do they do it like you know within hours of the <> accident or is it Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah  Yeah Yeah I think that's probably true too that's sort of scary Yeah Yeah yeah really really Yeah that's a bad situation I think most companies now as far as entry you know exams require that I think they should I'm a T I employee and I'm really gung ho for it In fact I you know some of the places now like I B M don't allow them smoking you know in the plant we have designated smoking areas But I work in sort of a building that's not really well it's on the campus of the T I facility but it's a little bit you know separated We lease the building And it's a factory environment And they have designated smoking but it's just wide open it's not ventilated properly and I think that's bad But as far as the drugs you know being in the factory kind of environment that way I think it's essential Yeah In fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years and I was giving my boss a hard time because I kept waiting for my name to come up you know they never called me they never you know and finally the day we declared war was my time No and my boss has gone for about like three times I think And I told him he's obviously in a high risk group Right right and of course you know they did <> specifically single them out when we started you know that they were going to do all them first Uh-huh Which I thought was interesting man yeah yeah Uh-huh what kind of drugs did you use if you don't mind Wow Really Well it's really lucky that you got away from that Cause that's really downward spiral Yeah Yeah that's it Yeah Just life in general Yeah well I'm definitely for it Plus you know you want to think that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share but that are not endangering your life in some cases like my husband several years back worked for Motorola And they had you know it was a chemical handling type Yeah and they have some serious chemicals out there you know like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing And they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals And that's really frightening So I think some you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know on a greater frequency than maybe just you know paper pushers like I am well you'd think so but I don't know if they do it till yet Because when he was at course now it's been years now because it was even before they had the designated smoking type stuff you know at T I I forgot what I guess it was like eighty-four eighty-five something like that And at that time they had no testing whatsoever So that's scary Lord Oh Yeah should we move Ooh That's awful Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah peer group is the other way now instead of Uh-huh that's Yeah it really is Okay Well I enjoyed talking to you Cathy
