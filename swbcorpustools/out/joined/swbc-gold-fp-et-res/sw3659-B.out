Okay Yeah I'm in Richardson Yeah Richardson well they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly if it's not raining And they also have a couple of areas where you can take cans plastic and paper to you know dump them off there if you don't want to wait and have a pick up least of paper but they don't pick up the other items They don't pick up cans or the plastic I'm not sure They only started to do the newspaper late last year Just kind of like a trial basis And see how it goes so I don't know if they're going to pick up the other things What about you Uh-huh  Oh Where do you take them  Uh-huh Uh-huh   One of the people from my department I think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the Dallas Shelter I think it was closer to downtown she's not here anymore but yeah Oh Yeah Well sometimes we always keep our aluminum cans And a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks You don't get too much money back I figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there But normally I collect like three trash bags full and I take them over to that can bank and it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans in the can bank Don't get too much money for them but Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers you know I seem to put them out there on Wednesday and like sometimes they come by sometimes they don't I'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that But I could certainly have three bins out there for you know plastic and tin and paper whatever they were going to separate into and have them pick it up on one of the two days per week That would be easy You're not supposed to have like the coupons in there or you're not supposed to put magazines in there and you can't take newspapers Now at work you know we have changed our recycling At first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle And not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears you can throw it in there because at first they said Yeah at first They said no telephone books You know well that's stupid and then they said no newspapers Well in my department everybody gets the WALL STREET JOURNAL There was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable So I thought that was pretty good to expand upon it say Yeah I still put my cans in with the cans I don't want it with paper Somehow that just seems weird to me Oh Ooh Well we had the one person who used to take things to the Dallas Shelter I think that's what that was called she used to collect from the whole department but she took them all down to that Dallas Shelter place I wish I could remember the whole name of that place but it's a charity for the benefit of this shelter And yeah she used to collect them from everybody in the department She'd go up and down with her little bag collecting from everybody
