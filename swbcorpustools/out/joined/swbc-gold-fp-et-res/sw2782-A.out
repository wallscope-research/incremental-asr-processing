Ready to talk Okay I want to talk about our family budget and the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked and give you a general description of it and you can help me out a little slash error--utt2 and 3 should be one unit bit Tell me how yours works Well at the my- I introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when I said that we're on the east coast now My husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that well we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina And so naturally we put ourselves we looked at our budget and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought was realistic And so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that's satisfactory and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently So you see Well we actually planned for about one year that God because listen it never occurred to us that it would take seven months And what we did was just decide how we had been spending our money before and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and adjusted where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down and we really lessened our living expenses more than what we thought we would But just our own design Uh-huh And the so but we've had budgets that didn't work when our you know of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked We spent too much money until our children went to college So tell me about do you all have a budget Wonderful Yes Three and a two year old Bang one utt bang Uh-huh Well I think that's important for your budget to be realis- for it to work though you have to do something Of course not Well I found that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents we tended to want to keep on giving lavish gifts as we had done before And I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down somewhat on your friends Yes Well I really do I think you have to budget those things though Yes Exactly although so much per month anyway And that really should be in your bu- but if you don't spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the month no no no no You don't want the government to spend your money You want to be able Well but I do realize that that is realistic for some people and it was for us many years for many years and if that's the only way that will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the year then doggone it that's what you should do Uh-huh uh-huh Well I was just reading an article in a North Carolina paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at letters of applications to universities she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty so it can be done where there's a will there's a way right Well I have enjoyed talking to you I know we'll have to stay home and mow the yard Bye-bye
