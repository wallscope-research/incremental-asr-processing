Well a little bit nothing overly strenuous No the majority of my camping experience is a tent by the lake type situation or maybe a canoe trip or something like that it's we've had a lot of fun I moved to Dallas about five years ago and we've made three different trips since I've been here The group of friends that I run around with of varying degrees of difficulty the last one we did and we haven't had a chance to duplicate was a canoe trip in Arkansas and the river it was up about three feet so it was pretty challenging and then we as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and find a clearing in the woods and go for it Well yeah yeah it's the that particular one was a two day trip so what there's a outfitter and they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you spend the night and then the second day head on down to the pool at the end of the river Yeah it really is Okay Okay Right right Okay Boy I bet yeah Uh-huh Yeah that's always been our next step our little group of friends here we've been kind of getting married off and what not but Yeah that well it just puts a damper on things for a little while But we're starting to get everybody back together Yeah we'd like to do a float trip down like Big Bend area or something like that No no we haven't made that trip yet I'll bet yeah Uh-huh yeah exactly not really just yet We've well I do have a little bit of property I grew up in South Dakota and I've got a piece of property in Minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet there's a little lake up there and a group of friends that I went to college with got together and we basically own all the land around this little lake there it's divided up into ten lots So we've got a private lake and it's completely undeveloped at this point so that's a possibility And the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime it's about two hours north of Minneapolis So yeah in fact well I got married last summer and that's we ended up there for a couple days on our honeymoon We kind of took a tour of the United States for about a week and up through that area But my wife's real excited about it so we're going to hope to get up there sometime early eno- last year it was the end of July and it was a little too late for the fish but hopefully get up there early enough to get into some of the fish and the the good weather and what not Uh-huh gosh yeah yeah That's right Sure Right You bet yeah we'll that you know and there's a lot of places with like nature trails things like that where they could learn a lot too You know it's like okay this is what a pheasant looks like you know and okay now we'll go look for one Well yeah that's everybody might learn something that way but yeah that's there's an awful lot of things set up you know just anything you want to do like you say it can be a water ski trip or fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching you know hunt with a camera type of thing or there's a lot of different opportunities for things like that It's a lot of fun it really is Hello
