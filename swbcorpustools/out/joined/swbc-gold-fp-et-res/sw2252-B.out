I don't know that it's so much a military threat anymore as a well you know it's real confusing right now to know what kind of a threat it is I guess it takes awhile to get used to something you know if they have completely chain- the place has completely turned that much around to where they're you know not what they used to be  Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah I thi- yeah the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute you know we're getting stuck into something here you know if somebody's about to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know we're ashamed we're not going to do that anymore And you know I'd like to think that that isn't true but I you know the evidence is that you know he's let some stuff go you know the east German situation It's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible you know if I'd have been asleep for five years and read it in a book I said no that couldn't have happened that way Uh-huh <> Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah I think you know what I'd have to I guess to answer the question directly I'm still just a little bit you know leery of the whole thing What I haven't seen is you know a great stepping back in the military situation You know it's one thing you know to let us go ahead and sort of disarm and you know I even had a thought once that the whole Iraqi thing might have been just a deal to go ahead and let us you know expend some military hardware Of course it didn't turn out that way And that may have been a kind of far out way of thinking about it I don't know Uh-huh <> Yeah Uh-huh Yeah or we can do something about it Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well the China situation you know the when it looked like that thing was turning around and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the Red Square or wherever said okay and that's enough And the tanks came in and you know pretty much took care of that And <> Uh-huh Yeah Well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward you know just some pretty hard by the socialism and you know the reaction you know the economic well the social structure of the Soviet Union you know it's coming apart at the seams You know and I've heard people say well you know it's just like the American Civil War will there be a union or not Well no it's not the same sort of a thing at all because that the whole Soviet system was put together under total force you know there was no as we are seeing now with a lot of those areas wanting out of it you know they nobody vo- you know a lot man those people didn't vote to become part of the Soviet Union they had no choice Yeah Uh-huh Yeah there was the whole thing was put together you know by force there's no real question about that And some of the countries that were forced in at later dates is the three Baltic countries you know came in the forties and well it's not that they came in it's they were conquered by the Germans and then the Russians even took it back from the Germans and never bothered to give it back you know so That's a a little different situation Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers I knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany they said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts all the bombs are going to go right over Germany and they're going to land in other places you know that's going to be the safest place to be Yeah well I guess what they'd have to do to I really don't know you know in the you know I hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears You know some reason or other you know is it's kind of a strange thing we've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say whoa wait a minute you know what's really happening here But you wonder how well this thing who was it Boris Yeltsin evidently was elected president of the Soviet for the Russian republic which is I guess the the biggest Uh-huh Well in the center but you got the the great big area that's was traditionally known as Russia and then all these little nationality groups around it you know you know was there nineteen of them or whatever you know and these were all the Soviet economists you know they had some real fancy names for them Matter of fact when the yeah what I read when the United Nations was setup in San Francisco one of the first things the Russians wanted to do was bring in each one of these you know republics as a separate country you know so there would be nineteen rather than one And the United States said well that mean we get to bring in forty-eight you know And that sort of you know they backed down on that Yeah well wonder if that wh- w- what do you get shot by something that's called an economic force or what is called a military pact you know it's all you can change the name of something but I wonder if it's still exists Although I've seen some evidence that you know the the Russian soldiers are well you the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because they're having housing shortages now What do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia and now all of a sudden they're going home and somebody's got to pay for their Yeah Well that's not Yeah
