Hello this is Jim in Dallas how you doing you're right here okay yeah I'm actually working tonight I just called and came in Do you work at T I Yeah I this not what we're supposed to talk about just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts and I thought I better make some calls Yeah Well I haven't got a chance to look at them yet My daughter got a few calls at home She talked to some student in I guess they give them to computer students too in Virginia something like that She's talked to two students Yeah yeah great we're supposed to talk about the elderly now I guess Do you have anybody that you are close to that decision on or anything or I've thought about it for myself and all and my wife's mother is in a retirement home She's not in a nursing home Yeah didn't we push I'll hit it again just in case I did it as she said yes But she's down in San Antonio and it's a brand new one It's a Catholic retirement home for nuns It's at Trinity no let me see Trinity I keep calling it Trini- it's not Trinity I'll think of Incarnate Word and they have a retirement home for the nuns and they take some lay people Yeah and that one's really super Now I know what they're talking about on regular retirement Yeah there's not too many they do have a wing where the people who are really sick you know have nurses And then they have other wings that we visited that are very nice it's just super yeah they have like a guard with locks We've been there once at night at Christmas She just went in last year She drives and everything she's perfectly healthy  Well her husband died They were in the military together and she just did not want to take care of the house and she visited the place and then fell in love with it and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind so to speak and so she's happy as heck and they serve meals of course They have clubs and a swimming pool so that's nice Now I know the ones where you're really ill we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one And they were all more or less hospitalized type you know really really sick It's a tough question you got more experience than I do then on it Yeah yeah that would be awful I never thought about that you know Uh-huh Yeah I think that hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it and they're getting nicer I've seen on T V where they take animals and young children in fact my daughter is one My wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school took them to an elderly home and boy that really pumps them up That is very nice to see young people I think that's one of the sad things is when you're in an older home If you just have people your own age you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything you know you can't take care of them kind of obvious you can't take care of children or animals in a nursing home but it's nice to have them visit and everything Yeah Right Yeah I think you do get more by stimulation in fact my mother in law just visited She's just about seventy-five Again perfectly fine and she visited us here in Dallas every time she goes back to San Antonio my wife has two sisters there too she said she's much better she's much more alive and active when she's been on a visit with somebody else you know and our routine has obviously hectic with teenagers and everything and she's much and so the stimulation part is really important I think like any animal anything you just lay around that's the fastest way to die I think you know yeah I'm afraid I'm a T V flipper Anything bad I flip it off But it's sad it's sad yeah yeah Yeah Right When I was younger I lived in the East I'm from the East really and it seemed like there were several people that I knew that had their parents {A I guess they would be but well in their seve- } living with them And one of them was even a woman who was fairly old and I guess <> she had her own separate room And I think whether it's more a custom up there or maybe because I was younger and it's just not a custom anymore to have you know the grandparents live with you anymore I guess that well we aren't getting away from that which is not right yeah right right Yeah Oh Well that's nice in a lot of ways Bet you were surprised that you said that by mistake Yeah right That's what I think about it for me I think Well my kids better not do that to me I don't want that you know So I think of it Well how would I want to be treated rather than well it's easy to say yeah let's put these old folks in a home but when I think I don't want to do that you know I don't want to be I'd want to have my little home I always threaten my daughters I say Well I'm going to build a little house behind yours and I'll take care of your lawn he says but I'm not going to one of those places Right yeah that's the way we call it which is really wrong But my wife's mother she's in San Ant- it's everything but The opposite of what you've seen it's a little hotel you might say Again a swimming pool and grounds and she has enough room She has two bedrooms and a separate living area They don't have kitchens or anything but it's like on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and make a meal you know yeah it's nothing like that It's like living in the hotel she's totally on her own and she still drives which does scare us some because she has dented a few things you know and we keep thinking about that you know because they get less alert and they don't care and I've seen some of these elderly people on T V you know the ones from Florida that just run into people and they don't even understand what happened you know I know I know Go ahead I'm sorry he still drives well it's wonderful in one respect but I don't know if you can afford the insurance yeah Yeah Right That's good people are all different I wonder if they should give them a test or at least maybe give them a refresher driving course just to see how well they are every five years Are they doing it Yeah Well everybody needs retraining It doesn't hurt you know the best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches and I don't know why you couldn't after sixty-five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving the insurance companies would probably help pay for some of that you know Right there you go there's a good point very good point Very good point But I think they maybe should do that and then the families
