Well does the company you work for test for drugs  no we're not being tested for drugs at all our policies and procedures manual the furthest it goes about drugs is in kind of the miscellaneous section or it's reasons for immediate dismissal it says use of narcotics on company premises So that's pretty general but I work for an environmental management firm and I'm an engineer there but I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites but I don't operate any machinery Now people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a medical monitoring program because they're at a higher risk of exposure and blood screening is part of that and I think that drugs they do test for drugs in that capacity but it's not their exclusive it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for But I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field What is the nature of your company's business  really Right that's been an issue in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening In fact they'll have these little parties and people will just get I've my brother lives where I work and I have many a time called him to come get me you know but you know they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg You know but I think drug testing and I don't know I think it's got some relevance but I think its relevance is pretty limited I think you know in your case I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident Uh-huh Oh Right
