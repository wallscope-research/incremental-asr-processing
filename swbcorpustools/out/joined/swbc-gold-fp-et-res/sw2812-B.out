Women okay that's not a broad enough topic I'm ready when you are Okay Yeah I'm here That's okay Okay I don't know are you in your thirties or okay Well then I can tell you that roles have changed I'm thirty-eight and they changed quite a bit I this was my twentieth high school reunion in Chicago And basically the choices you know you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that That's kind of the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies It was sort of just to go protest and just everybody be damned and live with some one and you know social morals were a little bit lacking Uh-huh Right it was more civil rights oriented or race oriented rather than gender based yeah Uh-huh It did It did and some of the other stuff that I think that changed it when I first got out of college fifteen years ago they were always saying well if you were assertive you were a libber or you were aggressive not assertive and independent And in terms of the corporate community I've seen a big change in terms of men finally being quote unquote used to women who are in controlling positions in the corporate hierarchy So I think that's good Uh-huh Right The mainstay yeah and restructuring stepfamilies yeah Right the schools or the parents yeah I'm trying to think of what else I have a lot of opinions on this except all of a sudden I went blank A lot of the things the demographics do there are more I don't have the numbers in my head right now but a lot of the things that brought feminism there are just more women in the demographics just generally in the United States in terms of being I'm the typical baby boomer I hate that term but in terms of women going out twenty-three I remember that What's it like to be twenty-three as a woman today when I was twenty-three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married those were the general issues Uh-huh He was ancient yeah Uh-huh You didn't know what you're going to be missing I don't have any either and I've been a married for eleven years so Yeah when it's time uh-huh Yeah you want to establish Uh-huh Right and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of women don't feel like they need to get married anymore I was twenty-seven when I got married and I just at the time my husband actually even jokes about it He was twenty-three when we met an I was at a point where it was like I didn't date I just went out to have a good time but I didn't have to have male companionship and a lot of the friends that I had in school at that point who had gone back and gone to law school or M B A programs which I also had done you know they were very sad But then by the time I got married it seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage track So I guess that's a big change in terms of just the attachments that women feel like they need to have the dependency their self-identity is stronger Yeah Right Uh-huh Right and I don't know how old your mom is she's probably let's see my mother's in her early sixties so Okay I'm thirty-eight your mother's for- I just turned thirty-eight yes I'm laughing my God It does start to creep up No but it's okay don't ever let age I don't thi- nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men Uh-huh Yeah an Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah you are because what I was going to say is what you will find is my background is in journalism and corporate communications and what you'll find is I'm just now finally to a point where I don't know why I didn't do it sooner but this is probably typical of the women's movement too is the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway if you want to go back to school I'm seriously considering going back to school for law which is a complete I wouldn't say career change it's a subway but it's still is a different application And if you think about it you know I still can have another career I've worked for over fifteen years in what I've done And so when you're saying quick I think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine is thinking that they have to do everyth- you know sort of I call it a chewing syndrome They have to eat real fast they have rapidity of speech they have to just go through everything And you'll find that probably by the time your twenty-eight thirty if you haven't slowed down something will slow you down Do you know what I'm saying because it's just you find out that you're really not smelling the roses and I know that sounds trite and all that Uh-huh it is That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh you're not no No That's true it's No you're extremely yeah it's ju- Well it's like us we're getting ready to do if possible for an adoption and I have friends that say well why would you do that if you know you haven't been able to children which we do know why would you do that now at this point and it's just individual choices I stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had in my family my brother's children he just turned forty his children will be out of high school before he's forty-five that's like your mother look how young she is compared to where you are out of school and everything It's just it but what you find is you don't compare the woman because you just get into trouble It's all independent and choices but what I was going to say about mothers is your mother probably just won't say it but my mother and her sisters are always saying to my cousins and I my female cousins you girls are so lucky because quote unquote you have all these choices you know you went to school you can do this you can do that we couldn't do that then And my cousins and I go well why couldn't you Uh-huh And that's normal I think that's the world today Right that's exa- Yeah What I'm right now I'm a free-lance writer right now And then what I'm doing is working at an electronics company for their company newspaper right now on the side and then I'm also actually I'm excited tomorrow I have a luncheon appointment with a perspective client to do marketing communications for them you are We- Here's what you shoul- d- this is off the topic and those people probably won- Did you go to Baylor by any chance okay that's even better I went to or you in radio or television or news my journalism degree is in
