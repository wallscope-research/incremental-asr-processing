I think I agree with that I think in a good example on the typical thing that happens when the phone rang and it's T I calling my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message and then I realize no this is something I solicited so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that I realized no I really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so that was almost an example of an invasion that turns out to be not invasive Exactly and at the same time I think that I receive on the order of probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it Commercial solicitations primarily Yeah And I think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control and one's feeling obligated because of some sense of the way the ritual is played out and that then ends up being the most common example for me I guess I'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this one that you raised And I don't think I would have thought about that I think that's a good idea on your part I don't typically feel intruded on the things the sense of finding out information to surmise It is there Well I guess although well that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest and I'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it well then I guess one could assume one was invaded but I don't feel invaded by it I don't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things I'm not sure why I guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts and if someone finds out something about me that is true I don't have a sense of loss from that the other side of that might be if someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense Bec- right because you don't have anyway to turn it off Tho- did you hear about this Lotus data base that was being put together That would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because I would find that there be a good possibly that their facts were fantasy And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information that I would rather they didn't and that might be the sense of the spending pattern for instance that I would have thought to be private But then if it turns out to generate incorrect things that's even worse or if my call rate of eight or so a week went up even higher because someone had Right And the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then all of a sudden you get your thirty a week because now their advertising you Right Exactly Right Right Right Uh-huh And I guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling threatened as a result of it so maybe that is a little bit of what privacy is Uh-huh that's interesting but no concept for wanting to be private Okay Oh That would be culturally shocking Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes that is true I haven't thought about that and that it's fascinating to think a lot of someone who doesn't know how to say private Yes Yes That's interesting are there any other specific things where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency Okay So that's another example of the invasion because of the not so
