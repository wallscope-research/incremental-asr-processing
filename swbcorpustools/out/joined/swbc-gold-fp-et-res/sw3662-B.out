Well this is about drug testing right Well I'm certainly under the influence of the idea that the government needs to have less control on what the citizens do although I do see this as something that definitely needs to be taken care of whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or the hands of the government is a different question I think as far as I'm concerned I- in other words I am in favor of drug testing I was drug tested when I came to my job here at T I Yet but  + but  at the same time I don't think that should be governed by the government per se I think it should be more by the private institution How about you Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Sure Uh-huh Yeah I agree with you you know I would even think that I could in theory take that you know a step further and say anybody in any job you know if the corporation felt like b- and this is why drugs are the biggest problem I think to face America today I mean it's what drives crime it's what drives any sort of pain and discomfort in the world or in America I think is somewhat driven by drugs and I think that were corporations and private industry to take command in this situation that maybe we might have some control over that We you know if you can't work be a little bit harder to take drugs or whatever I don't know Course that might up crime you know when people go in and steal your television and ste- and sell it just because they can't work anymore you know Definitely you're definitely right That you can't have it any other way you know in the case that you brought up you know you know w- if it's a policeman and he's working with the public and has a gun in his holster or even you know if it's a guy at McDonald's cooking a burger I think they're dangerous in either situation I what do you think what percentage of corporations and private industry do you think use drug testing really Uh-huh Right What kind of work are you in Uh-huh Uh-huh and did they give you drug testing Oh Okay Uh-huh so are they going to begin spontaneous drug testing Uh-huh yeah Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah What do you think about you know something that kind of concerns me is you know you and I are tested for whatever work we happen to do Do you think there should be drug testing for political officials Yeah I do too Yeah Uh-huh Yeah yeah Sure sure yeah I would agree with you I can't see how we can expect the you know people working in America to put any trust into our political officials if they don't you know just doesn't make sense to worry about legislation unless they're doing that themselves
