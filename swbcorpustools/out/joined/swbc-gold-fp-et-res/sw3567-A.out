Okay Scott let's talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university and I have yes some children I have three boys And they're all quite young and so we want to plan for their education or we're saving right now and we're getting bonds and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to How about yourself Do you have any kids So I imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your own college Very good what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah what you thought Just the degree itself Well that's good because I did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work I wanted to get a school that was small enough that was personable that you didn't have a lecture hall with about fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention and but I felt that I got a pretty good undergraduate I went to Utah State University which is in Logan Utah and the nice thing about it too is I knew that I wanted to get into business and that their College of Business was accredited and well known at least there in the State of Utah and around the surrounding states and so forth And so I feel like number one you also need to see what kind of name the like you mentioned before the name the college and university can give you and another reason why I chose that was the finances I wanted to make sure that I would be able to afford it that I wouldn't get through three years of the undergraduate work and have to leave And so I did a lot of talking with friends with family with counselors at high school and also read some books on the subject at the library And it was kind of unusual because my two older brothers and I all went to three different universities depending on what our choice was So Hopefully we chose the one that was best for us and I felt very comfortable and good about that So I don't think so I don't know the way that tuition is increasing exponentially it's kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow at the same pace that the college tuition is increasing I And that your children can use the benefits of that university Well that's an excellent idea that's an excellent idea One thing that we did and my parents and our family is that we weren't able to afford the kind of education that we all desired So my parents stressed that we get excellent grades so that we apply and try for scholarships and scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education because my parents couldn't And what the scholarship could not supply I was able to work for and save and get Also my brother he's a medical doctor right now He had to you know once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree he had to take out some loans and he's working to pay those off So I think that you know once you get past the initial stages of it that there's different options you can use and the student loans are good options Yeah Yes and as you're well aware that tuition's not
