Okay clothing at work I work as a news reporter and a lot of since I work in a small station this is my first job and so I dress very variedly if that's a word sometimes I'm shooting and doing photography and so I'll be in jeans one day and another day I'll be on camera and so I'll be in a suit and another day I'll come in and I won't know what I'm doing so I'll wear a pant suit in case I have to shoot So it really varies I try to dress very comfortably I don't really like dressing up at all I don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that I just I don't know it takes too much time out of my day and I don't know Yeah I don't mind it at all Uh-huh Okay White pants in a bakery Wow Okay What's the name of the bakery Italian I guess New clothes and stuff Yeah that's one thing I would like is  just to sort of have + I really don't like uniforms but just to have something I don't have to get up and decide what to wear That just bugs me to death yeah Sweats and Yeah when I was in school I was a sweat monster All I had was sweats and when it was time to go out I didn't have anything to wear Yeah Yeah let me see I hate shoes If I didn't have to have shoes I wouldn't have them my feet bother me and they're just tedious to go find shoes for me it's just I don't know I wear size nine and I don't know if just the shoes I get I either don't like them or they don't fit right and I just wish that I could just go without them really Oh Just the opposite But let's see what else do I wear when I do get into a bigger market I'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things and where I wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things and then I would be able to dress more business-like and things like that but we're all kind of just out of school at this station and so we're all you know still in sweats really So it's pretty fun though Yeah I Oh Yeah I like the suits with the they come like with a mini type skirt you know and the jacket I like that but I'm pretty short I'm five four and so that really doesn't flatter me but I think it looks good on taller people Are you Yeah any time I go to the store I have like two pairs of pants because I can never find any that are short enough for me and it's just ridiculous Pants too I could do without those Pants shoes Yeah those are nice Those are nice Yeah those are nice And tennis shoes My boyfriend's got me these L A Gear They're kind of big and hefty tennis shoes And it's just like a chore to pick up my feet Because I'm used to wearing the little white girl tennis shoes The little ones Yeah And I'm used to those They're just sort of you know like your feet you don't feel them You put these things on it's you know like exercise or something for your feet And I have to wear them because he gets upset if I don't so how do people in Wisconsin dress Warm I grew up in New York and so I know what warm is Like five pairs of socks and Yeah
