Well I guess we're forced finally to do a lot about air pollution I hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars and low polluting fuels are being experimented with Ethanol and other types of fuels you know I assume that the major sources are cars and factories But I don't know for sure I just know that acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from comes over the border from us Yeah Yeah the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes I guess there's been a lot of pressure to do away with the C F C's in these spray bottles which has been a real problem Again that's what I hear and there's this big debate apparently about whether there's a hole in the ozone or not but at last I heard it was discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially Well it is scary and I think it will continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively We've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment I'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't do that In Los Angeles they're apparently going to they've passed laws that for habit for example people using barbecues listen for habit> prohibit gasoline lawn mowers and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles and it's gotten bad in Denver and it's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky And people in this country are really wedded to their cars and our economy seems to and this I think is one of the big problems Yeah Yeah Well that makes a lot of sense I hadn't thought about it that way but it Yeah No and I think Yeah and I think that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it is an organism of sorts and that there is a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it and we're going to feel it and I think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy in this country whether people are willing to get out of their cars and in this country the solution that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable For example taxing people heavily for using their cars And I have a little sports car that I enjoy using and I know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but I think we're going to have to make some fundamental changes and I'm not sure how long it's going to take or what it's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and houses we sell
