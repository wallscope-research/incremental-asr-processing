Well what's your favorite baseball team Rita Well that isn't a true false or right or wrong test here Not a Cubbies fan Well that's all right How do you expect them to do this year Okay Well I'll tell you I just moved down from South Dakota in July and in South Dakota the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional sports team to where I was living and so everybody was a Twins fan and I didn't have much interest in the Twins you know it was kind of pathetic we only had two radio stations and one of them broadcast every Twins game live you know and the other one was country So that's right There's was Twins there or you know Skip Williams It sure was it sure was Well I would like to assume that they're going to do better this coming year I was sure hopeful anyway When we moved down I was able to go to my first you know baseball game and thought this is great this is incredible So I became a Rangers fan I didn't really have one in South Dakota So I adopted the Rangers or rather they adopted me I guess and it was just exciting you know you can watch baseball on T V and they hit the long ball and it looks like wow they really hit that ball But when you go to the ball park it's really not all that far you know and it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you and That's right that's right The Restaurant Ha- Huh Right That's right and he's still doing great still doing excellent Well didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the Rangers Management Right That's right You know some of the like Ivan Rodriguez wasn't even born when Nolan Ryan started pitching And it's just incredible to think that there are players who are the sons of ball players that used to play against Nolan or with Nolan you know and now their sons are Uh-huh I wasn't Was it Nolan against Ryan against Ryan Well that is neat Uh-huh Right
