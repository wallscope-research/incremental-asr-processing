What kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett Plano's doing real good on that they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans Which we're supposed to put all our week's garbage into it and of course it doesn't fit right now But now we start in May breaking it down and they're picking it all up So they're going to by and we have to separate our papers and our glass and then they have one day for like everything you picked up from your yard and we put that in disposable bags and they pick that up on Monday So it's really great I'm you know completely for it I think it's marvelous Well does your where you work do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that Well down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your you know pop cans and things like that So you don't have much choice there Well I work at J C Penny and last week they brought they have a sign up that says for one full week you bring in your old wire hangers and they're going to recycle them So it's getting people clean out their closets and such And then like the week before that they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good bring it in and they brought it down to the shelters And they have one two they have three I think that I know of for cans for people have pop and they put them right near where they have the time cards And it works great And they have one in the room where the snack machines are too So they're really going at it and I think it's marvelous because Well Uh-huh Well did you watch the program the other night on was it SAVE AMERICA It was good The only thing I thought that I haven't been trying is when I you know go to take a shower to save the water and to put it on my plants Which I had never thought about before But I've already gone to I started years ago I guess not years ago but yeah I would say five years ago turning off my water faucet in the sink when I brush my teeth But I didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water That was surprising to me I missed that question totally really bad I'm trying to think I didn't miss too many I can't remember what my score was but I did exceeding well I was surprised But I didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed That was a shocker to me Well I was in Bizmart the other day and what I don't understand is there is recycled paper in there and it cost more than regular paper And it was only I think forty cents more you know fifty cents more but It upset me to realize that they're going through the expense of recycling but people aren't buying it so the cost of it is higher Uh-huh Now see that's recycling you know companies that do at least go into it I'd like to see subsidy by the government or something or tax-wise or something heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular So that people would use this stuff over again It's like when he was saying which one was recyclable which was reusable and the recycle ones are better to use but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles And if we're going to really do something they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it I had to put my bifocals on to see it That's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway You have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf You haven't got enough nerve to say well put it back it's not recyclable Uh-huh really Oh You know they're along that same line they said they were using what is oh I know it was toilets You know the old ones Smashing them up because that stuff there is great in road work And I thought well that's good And then I saw recycling on tires between well hoses were being used and soaker hoses made out of old tires What else something else was made out of old tires I was trying to remember what it was I can't think of it now But I was trying to get my kids you know to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes And just anything to you know recycle rather than keep throwing it away but my biggest problem is I take the bags out of the store buy the bags to bring the back and then I forget to bring them in the store I'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out I wish they'd really push this recycling bit because I really didn't realize how much stuff I actually throw away You know what I'd like to see a little more I don't have any little tiny kids but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now in five years when they get bigger it'll work a little bit more too Because it's we've all got to do it right now I just I really amazed to find out that eighty per cent are filled now in garbage fills In five years we're supposed to be at max I don't think I can keep my own garbage I might not have that much but I wouldn't
