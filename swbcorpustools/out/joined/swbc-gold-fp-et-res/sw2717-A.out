I'll let you go first Yeah it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty Yeah I know what you mean I in Maryland they do have capital punishment and I've seen a lot of people get sentenced and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals Yeah what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years And here in Maryland I know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons just Yeah but in here it's to the point where they were letting prisoners go commuting the sentences of those that were in jail for lesser crimes in order to put more people into the jails And it was just amazing to me and of course they made a big deal out of the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out and being rearrested an I can't remember Refresh my memory I don't remember myself if they started executing them on a regular basis I think it might make a difference Right now I don't see it making a difference I don't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death most people out there committing murders don't care They just don't care Yeah Yeah yeah and there's a lot of people here in Baltimore that have and we just had a real big cocaine bust and of course you know they're playing it up real big that it looked like it was a very very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy But Baltimore has an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year I think they've got over a hundred dead already this year Well it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that there's I think X number of people out there that are going to commit murders and once you kill off a few of them if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that pretty soon you run out of people to murder Yeah Yeah Yeah you know it makes sense you know you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but so few and far between you know makes good T V movies and that's about it Yeah Yeah Yeah I had my father-in-law participated in a jury trial he was actually on the jury and this man was accused of killing I think it was two people and shooting a policeman point blank in the face Of course he didn't die And this was during a holdup of a restaurant and it came out during the trial that they had tried to rob another place and when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple you know jumbo cookies and so they were so upset from robbing this guy you know trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started you know shooting people You know it's Yeah Yeah and get even with who  you know stupid guys And it turned out that the you know policeman survived to the point that he was able to you know identify the guy And of course you know they tried to make the cop look like he was a no good rotten drunk it was amazing he was found guilty yeah He last I heard he beat a push for the death penalty Now whether they finally got it or not I don't know I kind of stopped listening after a while you know he would come home and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to dec- you know after he had to go Right And yeah everybody was pretty much you know let's burn him And you know that's the way they wanted to do it And he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he you know some people on the case were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but when it all came down they just within an hour decided the man's fate Yeah Yeah yeah well it went pretty quick from what he said But there's a lot of other crimes out there besides murder I think now if you're dealing drugs now caught more than twice or something there's a death penalty associated with it Uh-huh Yeah yeah I agree Yeah I agree I have a low tolerance for that kind of person And as far as you know there are some other crimes that I think you know kidnapping you know when they kidnapping per se has a certain fine and penalty associated with it but some of these people are just out and out brutal I some of the cases I've heard about over the years
