Real excited when I heard this So far I've been trying to call all day because I keep getting these subjects like capital punishment so football I love this This is great Well we're from Colorado so we're Bronco fans And we just moved here two years ago and they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here and they lost again That was pretty pitiful but they seem to be doing pretty good this year Oh Yeah Well have they just lost one game this year Two Yeah But they're not doing bad People are pretty surprised that they beat the Giants I bet boy I bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it Yep Yeah Yeah well I'm a big football fan I never wou- my father was a football fan my whole life and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff and I just hated it And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays so when I met my husband he was watching football and I figured out that I couldn't see him all weekend I couldn't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL if I didn't like football So Yep Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Well I do I love it I just think it's such a fun sport And I'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet We're not convinced that we're going to be Cowboy fans yet But Well I guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here That's even harder But No we're just this is only the second place we've lived We've only been married for five and a half years And we have two small children and he just got transferred here to E-Systems so Oh Well I tell you this the weather here and there's no mountains or anything you know and when you go to a football game in Colorado you know there's snow and it's an adventure And here yeah you've just got to drive down to the stadium and Yes Well he's from here So Yeah That's what I hear Which is rare Which is good Yeah But I you know it's funny in Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three times in the last I don't know five or six years whatever it's been they have these songs on the radio They take popular songs and change them to fit the Broncos and stuff And they had I was just thinking about one the other day if I saw a picture of John Elway in the cafeteria at school but they did the Johnny Angel They did Johnny Elway to that and I was trying to get my son to sing that My husband was just having a fit <> don't have him sing that song But they do a lot of fun things I think football is kind of a sport that I think you kind of it's hard not to like it Because you know there's just It's exciting Yeah Yeah Yeah they probabl- I wish I would have bought the tape when I was in Colorado Because I think about that a lot But you know when I first moved here well I guess it was about a year ago they did this This interstate seventy-five song Or whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety-five and everything That was kind of a funny song but they sure do it seems to me like they really love their Cowboys here Even when they were losing pitifully you know people still support them We drive by some houses everyday that have big signs we love the Cowbo-
