I'm of the age that could have gone although I didn't and I guess looking back on it I tend to think it was mostly a mistake On the other hand the more I learn about the history the more I see it was incremental decisions Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time but on the whole I think it probably was the wrong thing to do How about you Uh-huh Yeah Right Yeah slash error Yeah slash error should be 'b' Yeah it's funny Tonight I was helping my kid with an essay on Stalin And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how in World War Two the personalties of Stalin Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was almost a personal struggle among these three I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense they're certainly all leaders and with their nations pretty solidly behind each one of them And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the early decisions of the Vietnam war That the people saw the cold war as you had to draw a line and defend it Otherwise they'd get you someplace else Looking back it seems like that was only partly true That there might have been a better place to draw the line I guess you can say that a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight brought the cold war to an end But I don't think you can just fight anywhere just in order to call the bully out and beat him And I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward And we were wrong But I you know like I said the more I hear about it the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable But the accumulative effect was to really get into a hopeless situation where and as you say going halfway was probably worse than committing to a completely and winning it whatever that would mean Yeah Yeah Yeah Well you're not It's ambivalent yeah what about the domestic effects like I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it possible and even popular to criticize the government And they that pendulum started to swing maybe even too far To the point where supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on And that tradition is still it's dying now but it's still alive as opposed to this Desert Storm stuff may have killed it But I think that was one of the biggest that you know the domestic unrest
