just about any kind of music except acid rock I don't care for acid rock but I grew up with country and western but just about any kind of music I even like classical music Yeah Yeah I grew up with Hank Snow and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs But I did you happen to see last night the special on Channel Two with James Galway Oh That is fabulous We Yeah when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing Yeah and it was tremendous Yeah Yeah Yeah uh-huh and it was mostly all Irish tunes they had a band with him that had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the tin whistle and a couple of violins and drum and they played all the Irish jigs and so forth it was just fabulous Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah I especially like instrumentals Yeah I love to just lay back on the couch and turn a good instrumental <> on and just close my eyes and listen Yeah <> I've never played an instrument in my life I've always wanted too I've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something but but I'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music and I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir Yeah Yeah Well like I say the acid rock I just do not ca- an I don't care for rap music either Uh-huh no If I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it Yeah Yeah Right But I like orchestra music too Like the Boston Pops or anything Uh-huh Yeah Yeah they're good And we went and saw LES MISERABLES the music in that was fantastic Yeah Yeah it I can't remember how far in advance we reserved tickets but it was you know out at the State Fair Music Hall and it was well worth the price Yeah Yeah just ever so often you know a real good one like that one and I went and saw I think it was SUGAR BABIES that was good that had good music in it that was the one with Mickey Rooney and what's that not real old my wife she is old too dancer I can't think of her name I got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it Helen something real long legs and dark hair I can't think of it Yeah but Yeah yeah yeah The Blackwoods Yeah Alabama  Yeah Yeah either Alabama or Hank Williams Junior I never have either and I never have figured out how he won entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row Yeah I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is probably Eddy Arnold Uh-huh But I sold some of them I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight R P M records of country and western songs Smiley Burnette I don't know if you were old enough to remember him He played in the old western movies He was the sidekick of Gene Autry I believe or they I think his name in the movie was Froggy and had a real raspy voice and some of those old ones of course Bob Wills Miss Texas Playboys Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an Yeah I took them up here to Collectors Records and was able to get a little money for them but my mother and dad use to own a restaurant and they had a nickelodeon of course in the restaurant and when they would come and change the records the guy would give her the old records so that's where I got my Yeah Of course there's not a whole lot of market for seventy-eight R P M records Well the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that particular kind of needle and they just won't play on a modern day phonograph Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Of course they you know just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because you get that scratchy sound Yeah yeah Yeah th- warped real easy Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah But I guess you know the old country and western music you back then when I was a kid there wasn't that much T V so that's all you had to listen to was the radio and Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera Yeah Yeah seems like it was on a Friday Friday or
