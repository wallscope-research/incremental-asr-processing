Yes Yeah Well as I look at our trial systems I think they've gotten to be quite a joke The way the people can appeal and file for mistrials and they've taken a lot of the things that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage I think that a jury should listen to the courts to the hearings and to everything but I think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision I think the judge should hold maybe even forty-nine and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other I think he should And I think that there should be more than one judge There should be maybe two at least that sit in and listen so that there's no way that you could have like a crooked judge Do you know what I mean and I think that it's important to have a jury but I think the way that they go through so much time to get it a fair one That's okay too As long as it's not used to delay the trial so much They need to have a fair jury but they only you know would cover forty-nine percent of the decision or fifty percent and then the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision How do you feel about that Right Right Right Right Well what if they used you know I just had a thought come as you were talking What if they used law students and had that be credit hours to sit in trials Yeah at least At least on the jury And that would give them experience in the courtroom and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major Right That's right That would be a really good thing to do I have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial and what happened was her husband was involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight and he ran into the motorcycle But the actual reason that her husband was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle He was just taking it home from the place It was brand new and his brakes did not work And this expensive big company that owned these motorcycles railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened and they were following him home in the car Saw the whole thing happen That's right They were following him home from the motorcycle shop And they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials this and that and the other Every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of her of a settlement Until finally they won and said that it was the drunk driver's fault and she would have to sue him needs slash unit Which I would think it would be some his fault but I just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money the big lawyers and she didn't Right Right And I don't know all the details on that but I certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the students coming into the jury And I don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say
