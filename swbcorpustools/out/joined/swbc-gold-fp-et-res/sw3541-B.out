never the only thing I'm thankful of is that we don't have to pay any income tax in Texas Yeah Boy I tell you what I sure hope they don't pass something like that Well I tell you I remember every time it seems like we turned around they're adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline And actually that one the taxes on gasoline don't bug me as much as what are we eight and a quarter percent sales tax And every time you go to buy anything now even you know they tax food That's the one that really kind of bothers me I got you because people that don't make very much money wind up spending it all Yeah whatever they spent it on they have to pay tax on what do you think of that new luxury car tax anything over ten or thirty thousand dollars sure No no I haven't but to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax on top of it And there's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand Yeah Right Right Sure Well what about the taxes on cigarettes
