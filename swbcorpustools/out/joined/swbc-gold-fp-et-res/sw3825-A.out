Yeah at first I it took eight times to find you  so I told my husband you know what should I say and then he reminded me but in his family what they usually do on his dad's side his mom or the aunts will send out little postcards like two or three weeks before reminding everyone where to meet and you know just to bring anything and so they just notify everyone by mail and then they just meet at like a park or something to have like a small dinner type thing well they all meet in Portland and they come as far as Seattle and sometimes we've gone and we were living in Utah at the time And his dad's family is all around the area and his mom's side of the family they all have their family reunions in southern Utah and people would come from Seattle to there let's see Nevada and in that area Washington and Nevada to southern Utah and each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody Yeah yeah and the people who are down there like they'll assign one person in the Utah area one person in the Washington area and that person can call you know beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too And then they just sort of do like a little program or you know something like that so that everyone's sort of involved well that's my husband's side and my family we all live in southern California so we just have to either or give a formal invite and we're all there so Yeah well L A Orange County area everyone's you know mostly not farther than an hour away Uh-huh  Wow Well you know that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my husband's mother's side together is they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time and inevitably everyone is just very interested and they always have you know two or three new ones to add to the list you know someone's been born or someone passed away or you know something like that and so everyone has to update their little books or whatever I do but not very much compared to my mother-in-law   Really Is it your grandma's own sibling and she I see so Well maybe they just moved away and then sort of lost contact
