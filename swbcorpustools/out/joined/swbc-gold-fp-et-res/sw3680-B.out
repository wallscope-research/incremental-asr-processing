Okay Well I'm a Vietnam era veteran and I was fortunate not to have to serve in the theater however my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation I'm of the old school that believes that the contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored However I think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker but those are my personal thoughts and I think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run World War Two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people But as it was the politicians ran the Korean conflict and ultimately the Vietnam thing and we managed to come out losers all the way around And so this is what ultimately triggered us United States per se deciding to get out of the role of world policeman Your views Well We got into it because of SEATO agreement back just right after World War Two that we pledged a mutual defense of the South Vietnamese and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another and really we I question us you know now of course hindsight is all too clear so we have to deal with the situation as we played it I don't get me started on those people You know before Jane Fonda did what she did I thought she was a wonderful person but after well I just don't want anything to do with her any more because you support your government okay right or wrong I don't think we can determine whether we were right or wrong because you're having to deal with again I think we could have made a different agreement back in the late forties era that would have kept of there Can you hold just a second Terry One moment please Sorry for the delay yeah this is the mutual defense thing was we it was complicated and I don't think everybody knows the whole situation I don't But from what I can gather is we went and said yeah we will help the South Vietnamese should they ask Well the French went in and tried their old style warfare and got soundly thrashed And we didn't do a whole lot better Well yeah that was the old French colony but see the French were our allies in NATO and they're also our allies in SEATO which was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization which has since been disbanded as far as I know you know NATO is on the way of being disbanded but you know the French yeah we go in as an ally to the French and says yeah we'll help you out if you get in a bind Well they got in a bind and says we don't want to you know play any more so we kind of got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly operations and then the you know full scale troops et cetera et cetera et cetera yeah yeah roughly
