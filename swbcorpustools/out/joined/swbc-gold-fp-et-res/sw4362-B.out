well having sort of the reason we're going through the school system I seem to be younger than most people who talk on this thing I'm just graduating from college I didn't really perceive much of a problem with the school system However when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and ad- you can compare just about thing to Japan and we look like we don't have anything it seems to be not difficult enough for students Not challenging enough And just not generally competitive enough however if it weren't for our needless competition with Japan I'd think that the school system works at a pretty good pace Uh-huh Right Yeah  Right well I don't pretend to understand that either but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools But then again I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put because the dropout rate is in those areas w- it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime And they all seem to go together And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle where you have the dropout rate and crime and you know general poverty kind of conditions that things ought to get better So the other two a- they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways And clearly to me is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know it's a complicated issue I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school Well that's I meant when I said the school  Well that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district were well paid Uh-huh Yeah Well it Right Yeah well that's true But there's you can always play games with talking about whoa look at this My tax dollars are paying for this This is wrong But when you're w- and there's really not much you can directly do about that I think that if there is a problem with the school system it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well paid That perhaps that might be one area that could be improved w- you have other professional jobs and this is a profession And as a matter of fact it's a pretty big influence on
