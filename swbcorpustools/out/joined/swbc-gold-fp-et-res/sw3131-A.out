We're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis and probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process Uh-huh Uh-huh So it was pretty much a physical decision  Yeah My husband's family are reaching that point but it's so difficult Was she in favor of it or was she kind of opposed to it Uh-huh Yeah So often I think though elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad I work with a lot of elderly people I'm a trust officer and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very balanced meals Yes Well you know that's part of the aging process That your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste It really is Yeah Uh-huh Yeah And the portions people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals I do that right now and I'm not near nursing home age Yeah Uh-huh So as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah That's a given Uh-huh And sometimes the help there does it I think Uh-huh Uh-huh Adapt Yeah as I think I mentioned I was in the trust business and I've seen so many elderly people Usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money but the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the retirement places where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better as far as elderly people adapting They're able to move in while they're still independent and still social and they do group things And then if health or mental capacity deteriorates they're able to take the next steps without so much change and I wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in It's really kind of difficult Yeah Uh-huh Well and it's the first step in actually accepting that you are failing and aging You know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and I've seen people really fight it that desperately needed to make the change they became in fact that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother She's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision And that scares me the thought of forcing somebody to do something Yeah Uh-huh Not as independence Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah And the quality of life really isn't there it's tough it really is Uh-huh Well they fear being dependent on somebody they fear being a burden to family members My husband's mother will have major surgery and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation She'll let something slip and we'll say wait a minute and that's it she just well I didn't want to bother you She can't accept that we want to be the care givers Yeah Well she stayed in a temporary nursing home Until she was okay You know it's just but it's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her She's down in Temple and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on So it's difficult it really is and we're all heading that way and Uh-huh Yeah <>
