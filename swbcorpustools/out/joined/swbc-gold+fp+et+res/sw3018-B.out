Oh uh let's see I uh I have enjoyed uh THIRTYSOMETHING in the past uh now that it has gone off Uh some comedy shows uh I can not can not think of off hand but what what are your what is Yeah Yeah Yeah uh yeah yeah we + we wa- we try to catch that most most nights Yeah It it was kind of interesting uh some people complained about uh uh the kind of whining or whatever on it I I really did not think it it was that way I think it had some some good uh good situations that it presented Yeah Well I think I think a lot of people you know kind of felt that way but they had a lot of uh uh counseling groups that use some of the episodes as as examples of things that were going on and and uh yo- you know that they called interaction between people and sort of to use as uh as a way of getting people to talk about their problems and that sort of thing Uh we kind of uh our T V viewing has uh slowed down a little bit since our our daughter came along so uh that that tends to uh put a cramp in your viewing because by the time you get through getting her ready for bed and everything uh it's uh very little T V time left Yeah Yeah that's right No I I can not uh typo cannot I don't think there were Uh I have not I have not uh uh there are not as many good shows that I that I continuously like to watch as much as I used to I uh you know ther- I uh I used to could be able to name ten shows or so you know that I felt were worth my time to watch but uh I uh you know very seldom like to watch you know those there's a couple now that I tend to want to watch I like uh home improvement shows like Bob Vela's uh HOME AGAIN on Saturday morning it's I notice it's like it's like THIS OLD HOUSE yeah but it's uh it's on instead of being on pub- P B S it's on regular T V But it's uh it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house and Yeah so I like to watch that and uh some some things on P B S I like to watch but uh Yeah if it's someb- if it's a team or something that I am really interested in I am not one to just watch a football game just just to be watching it or or I am not a big basketball or baseball fan if it unless it's baseball if it's some if it's a team I really like I may watch but uh baseball to me is a little hard to watch on T V for an extended period Yeah it's so slow that you just get bored you know I I will switch between something else and and a baseball game going back and forth you know watching it But I usually if if if it's a football team I really like a college team or or pro team that I am fond of I usually will sit and watch that But uh that's the Yeah Yeah it's kind of like like baseball Right I think that that's what more people are doing and I think that's you know as as T V I think the less good shows being on T V has caused a lot of people to do to do that uh you know get more movies and watch I know we we have done that too in the past uh we do not do it quite as much now cause our baby will not let us watch them But uh you know we usually will we used to rent uh two or three movies on a weekend and and try to watch No uh we live in No No we uh the uh development we moved into was they have it on one si- like right across the street from us but when they built our section they did not did not put it in and we have been there about two years now and they are still still do not have it so I am hoping that that soon they will they will I have contacted them about this and they say that well it's it's they look they every year they look at uh different areas and try to determine where where uh the most houses will be and so they uh they look and they when they when we reach a certain number of people in that area they will put one in put some in or they will at least consider it so Yeah Um Yeah Yeah I have I put some put in some uh an antenna a really good antenna and uh it's really helped you know ours and it's not been too bad I have not really missed it that much there's certain things that I have that I want to see you know occasionally like a football game a college game or something that happens to be on cable or some old movie but the uh I I have not been bothered by it too much So Right Okay Alright bye
