So what do you think about uh recycling programs in Atlanta Julie I don't know there's there's big bins out there I don't know if they ever get I I really don't know what the details are There should be someplace where you could call and find out As a matter of fact I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest you know thing to you but I think there should be some kind of curbside service That's the only way I could really Uh-huh During the summers like the around where I live the uh homeless people see- I mean they all have like shopping carts and stuff and they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff and so we used to just save them up and then they'd come around and we'd give them to them But when during the winter time I think they they move south or something so I don't do that anymore And the the recycling at Georgia Tech like that uh outside the uh student center they never empty those things They just overflow So what's a guy to do You know  Shouldn't this end in a slash  I asked myself Really Huh oh yeah that's true hadn't thought about that That is very inconvenient Inconvenient even But uh so you do recycle don't you Yeah I'm kind of I'm kind of bad about it If I if see a s- if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I'll throw it in there but I don't really I don't ever take anything Uh-huh But wait I've never seen you before Who are you Yeah my name's Bill Well Hi Me too Crazy Uh well is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy Julie Do they do like what about like uh what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle do you know Really What about like those grocery bags Uh-huh Uh-huh They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic uh Those petroleum products are going to kill us The hostile planet I think Julie The petroleum pretty much I mean those petroleum products I think are the big uh you know the great Satan of the recycling Um Paper just seems so innocuous Paper doesn't seem threatening at all you know It comes from trees How can it be bad They treat it with chemicals or something Why can't trees break down I don't get it Yep Oh <> Really Huh I'm going to switch from those yellow legal pads then I'm glad you told me that because I use those at work where I work and uh But I can just forget that from now on I'm going u- I'm going to switch to the white ones Well what about uh papyrus you know made out of bam- you know bamboo stuff from the from the banks of the Nile You think so Tablets I think we should just abandon the you know the written word altogether you know What do you think Kind of radical I know but That's true Everyone had a two way wrist watch T Vs on their wrist like uh Dick Tracy
