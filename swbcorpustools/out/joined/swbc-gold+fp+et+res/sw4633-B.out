How many children do you have now You have five Well you do have a hard time finding time then don't you Uh-huh You sound so young All right <> To have them uh I think you're doing a good job I just have one child And uh I don't think uh well there's not much I can do about it My my wife and I are u- in our forties you know so uh but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the they're the pivot point of the universe Yeah Uh-huh I have a younger brother like that I'm in my forties like I say and I have a brother in his twenties And I was I was the youngest So I understand how that worked And he was treated like he had five fathers or something Yeah Did you all do a lot of organized things like uh Little League uh soccer Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah You know I think that's probably true The if you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or activities and if you have a large number of children or then you don't No you ca- and there's not enough time uh like my son is in uh Little League this year He's ten And they practice three times a week and they have a game and it's just uh if there were more than one child I don't know the- there would be no way to do it You know one parent go one direction and I'd have to go in the other and we could only cover two at that Uh-huh Uh-huh I don't think although i- i- I think a a more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me but I'm not sure I could afford three I most certainly couldn't educate three I don't know how my my parents did it I mean there were five of us and I don't recall you know wanting anything in particular Uh but I don't know how my father did it He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children But we did okay We had a house and a home and but now my wife and I both work and we don't I don't believe we have as much as my parents did and we only have one child Uh-huh Huh Atlanta is horrible Yes Ha- we have a lot of people moving here from Boston and and different areas and from talking to them they're shocked Wha- and they you know the housing is so cheap in comparison to Boston that they jump on it They sell their house they stash away a good bit of money and come down here and I work with a lot of them they they think they they have really done something Then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to to where they came from The housing is cheaper but that's about it
