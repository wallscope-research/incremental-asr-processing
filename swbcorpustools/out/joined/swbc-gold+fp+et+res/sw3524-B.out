Oh my yeah Well and Plano Texas rather than Plano Illinois Yes they do Yeah Well let's see the three questions are what uh Very little Because they're grown They're grown and gone Huh Yeah because they don't want to know they almost don't want to know us Uh yes I have uh two married two almo- and then two almost married and the other two I'm not sure Well Two s- two two uh uh for sure are single Yeah we have between the spouse and myself we have six Because I came with a split family and she had Well no there is so much of them are gone and they're doing their own things and and a lot of times they they've got you know uh when the holidays Yeah and sometimes they want to do their own thing so sometimes it's just spouse and me And and you know what Sometimes that's okay Because You know right because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays Yeah That becomes a drudgery and Well let's see n- got of the six we've got four around here Uh you know well we're talking like north Texas And then one is in Vermont uh Montpe- Mont- Montpelier Montpelier Vermont and the other one is in Everett Washington Well that is that's the the my little pair And my second marriage Uh and uh Yeah well the s- the the the the fourth and fifth child of the of the of the uh six are the two that are scattered like that And Well they wanted to go uh J R my my my last son or my middle son excuse me fell in love with Washington state and the the the third daughter fell in love with uh uh Vermont So Yeah that's where they've gone to make their homes No Well uh let's see yeah I guess you'd say J R is working going to s- trying to go to school I wish to God he would go back Yeah Well I certainly hope so Uh-huh Well it's oh I agree it's never too late And Yeah and when you're saying older we're talking fifty up Uh-huh Oh my uh-huh Yes why not because that's a a lot of times well it's I believe that uh we in that category and I'm not in that category quite yet but we are seasoned minds Yes uh-huh Yeah it was Yeah settle down we know what we're wanting to to uh study and uh we know our limitations And we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether At seven yeah Yes we're we're smarter now Yeah right uh so let's see So mine I don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here And so the second question forgot what the second question Well uh the trends in the families were to spread apart do your own thing But I have seen lately yes I am seeing I'm seeing a change that whoops government can't do it schools are not able to and between a person's religion uh their their faith in their maker w- whether you know uh whether you're Christian or Jewish or whatever uh and the family those are the two that can that that have the wherewithal and of course Judeo-Christianity uh and of the Jewish folks too believe that the family unit is the one that was given the uh uh mission by the Lord to do this very thing So when another group of of uh people step in try to do it they're they're tromping on our territory so to speak so I firmly believe that uh
