It seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution And I can very clearly remember ten years ago I was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful and we did end up with uh I B M P Cs which I now would not have chosen But that was before the Macintosh And twenty years ago I was uh in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter So I would say that's one of the largest changes in at least in my life Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah thirty years ago I I had a college job uh working as a programmer and we had to write code in binary and uh have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which I don't think exists anymore You never see one of those punch cards anymore Well very possibly Uh I'm not sure in the last ten years it's been very different from before Uh certainly in the last thirty I would say there have been significant changes Even even the change from black and white to color television Thirty years ago I guess there were color T Vs but I sure didn't have access to one And uh but twenty years ago practically everybody had a color T V and now I think they're as almost as many well there are more T Vs than households so it's close to getting uh one T V per person they say Uh-huh Yeah Certainly ten years ago uh V C Rs were just coming on the market so that's made a significant difference in the way I watch television for instance because uh now I almost never watch a T V program when it's on I tape it and then watch it when it's convenient and that way I don't have to worry about being interrupted I can just put it on pause Right Uh-huh Yes you can watch a program in forty-five minutes instead of an hour You skip the commercials Wasn't the decline so much I think they just said the changes in uh social social changes in the United States How was life different ten twenty or thirty years ago So Yes Yes That's certainly a difference Yeah that's another one yeah car phones is a good point and uh cellular phones of all types and beepers Uh ten years ago I was working in a job at a medical center and I had to carry a beeper around and they were kind of bulky and all they did was just uh make a beep noise and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call These days they have these tiny little things that are only about the size of two or three pencils and they fit in your shirt pocket and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a a phone number to respond to and Yeah those are pretty neat And they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off in a theatre or something and you can still get your messages But let's see social changes uh uh I haven't the slightest idea I was just thinking though about a a huge social change in the last ten years is AIDS It was just beginning to be recognized and noticed ten years ago I I know that because I was writing a paper about it I was writing a a journal article Uh and they still didn't even know what caused it or anything And uh there was a suspicion that it was a virus but nobody had identified it and they were really just going on epidemiological uh uh guesswork uh because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like uh hepatitis and then from from the spread pattern of hepatitis they could work backwards to the transmission by uh blood and semen And then I Well I I was in English as a matter of fact and medieval studies uh but I went to work as an editor and writer so uh uh the ten years ago I was working in the medical center uh publishing a journal and writing about medical topics And let's see twenty years ago I guess we 're were just beginning to get into what they were calling the uh the sex revolution where uh after the pill and uh uh freed people up from worries about uh illegitimate pregnancy and I guess in the seventies is the the time when that was supposed to have exploded Thirty years ago there was no pill Yes I do I really do I have uh four kids in college right now children and stepchildren and I know that the expectation for them was uh to have sex and much earlier than the expectation when I was in college In my day we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be sleeping with their boyfriends But they certainly didn't expect everybody to and it was really only uh acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in in the relatively near future And I certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays And I guess the answer is is stay flexible because nobody can predict what's going to happen in twenty years I certainly wouldn't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what uh my kids were likely to be like Course one of them was just a a a brand new baby twenty years ago so I sure wouldn't have been able to predict for him And some of the other ones weren't born Yeah Electronic mail I just got on that this past about a year ago and that's made a difference in the way I do my job because it's so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things Even when they're on another continent Yeah Even you know that reminds me Federal Express was around ten years ago but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency and nowadays people use Fed Ex all the time People do seem to travel more It's much more common for people even teenagers to be going to Europe and South America and Asia Uh I was almost thirty before I got off this continent And uh both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school Uh-huh Yeah
