W- Well what do you think Uh-huh Well I agree that it's a big task but I think that I think that the U S should move toward some kind of national health care plan At least as a long term kind of goal And possibly y- just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing but I think that ultimately it would be a good idea to uh and not have a completely socialized medical system in the country maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now It uh just because it seems that uh health insurance costs are sky rocketing well as fast as the national deficit perhaps and so that and that's a that's a vicious cycle of course Because Um Well I uh well I wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately I don't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea And uh Right The well as it is now the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance and so that the other people have no health insurance and you know they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies and somebody winds up paying for that and basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance so I don't see that anything that this situation would get any worse That way it might get better Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah well I think
