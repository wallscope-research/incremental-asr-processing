I don't know if you feel the same but uh when it comes to telling kids that they have to do uh two or three years of service into some kind of community I don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that and say you know you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen or you know in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do And uh I as far as a high school course I could see it as uh maybe a social uh sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program and to me that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year but to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter post high school of community service I I'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do Uh-huh Exactly Right Right Uh-huh Exactly And doing it for a purpose that they want The other thing is this I have thought about this on many times when you get these uh young troubled teenagers that uh don't have like the perspective of uh uh of the community a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems but there are other people out in the community that may have problems Then I can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing You have to do so much as far as in community service now If they were you know th- abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse Or if uh they destroyed some property around the uh area then they would have to do uh to restore it and perhaps uh work uh for the community to beautify it or whatever but I could see that working in you know cases where it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever And that's I think they have done that and judges have said well you know this is what you're going to get for a you know a misd- misdemeanor or something you may end up having to do some kind of community service so I could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled so Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure We sure do Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Exactly Yeah Uh-huh And there's a lot of anger sure You know especially if they haven't went through treatment and they dealt with other people in the uh system of prisons which uh you you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever I would say the crimes would probably be you know if you went in for a certain crime there might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have so you're dealing with people uh that may uh be an influence later on and uh an issue of anger would be is that I went to prison for a year or two but I didn't get any rehabilitation or uh you know But then again those that have physically assaulted somebody uh that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in the community if they're of a violent sort and to say
