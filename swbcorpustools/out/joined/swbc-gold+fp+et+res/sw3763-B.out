Uh-huh Uh baseball Well I've been kind of been intrigued with the Rangers uh more so with uh uh their management than anything else I I don't follow baseball that that closely but uh you know since I live here so close to Arlington uh that's the team that I've been kind of following Uh-huh Right Well I think that uh you know with uh so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's um you know I think I'm not real sure about th- do you know anything about Ruben Sierra's uh Yeah that he was willing to come down a little bit and uh if the Rangers will go up a little bit  I think this should end in a slash B's next turn seems to start with a backchannel of A19  Yeah I think this should be an independent utt; see note on B18  but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty-five mil- that's a lot of money Yeah they are Uh-huh And I really think I really think that uh that they ought to I'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money I think they should uh uh pay him what his salary is going to be uh and let him because he's got one more year before he turns into a free agent And then uh who knows if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway but if he doesn't then his market value will go down and they can pick him up for for a lot less than than they would uh if they paid him the si- you know the six million dollars a year this year Uh-huh Oh yeah but you know what he that was a great deal for him Yeah it was a great deal for him and and uh he just signed on uh I think it was like a five year deal with uh Pittsburgh So you know he's real happy there As far as the Rangers are concerned I think I think they need some definitely need some pitching Uh and so I you know I The pitching coach Well you know I was just looking at the news tonight and they showed a a a black guy that was go- was helping out uh His assistant And I think that's a a great addition I mean he seemed to know what he was doing and and uh Oh you don't like Howse huh Oh Tom Grieve Yeah I'm I'm not sure that um that they're ready to get rid of of uh Tom Grieve yet but Howse might be a different uh situation and I think you're probably right that they that they need some you know some changes in uh pitching coach maybe and um You do huh That's contrary to uh popular belief you know Oh I know You know it's too bad that uh it has to be a forty-two year old guy to to lead the uh the Rangers you know They need to have some some young guys that can take the lead and and uh Yeah
