Okay you go first Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well yeah it it's it's pretty much what I was s- going to say is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in Uh I grew up in New York and uh the place or not New York City upstate New York and I went to uh the City of Rochester School District and s- a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs and it wasn't we weren't too far removed geographically from each other but the difference in schools I think was pretty substantial and uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system And that would result in some uh could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with As a result the schools were rundown there wasn't as many you know of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked There wasn't as many advanced placement courses uh when I was a senior that some other schools had And uh it it so I you know I think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away to get better schools So you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Why is that Why is that Right Right Right Uh-huh Yeah yeah Yeah I know that that that was a big factor for me I ended up coming out of of the public school system very well and was very good education uh ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been you know which is really nice and I think the difference for me was that my parents were you know they were definitely they were always there was like well yeah of course you're going to study and do well and that's the way of course are you
