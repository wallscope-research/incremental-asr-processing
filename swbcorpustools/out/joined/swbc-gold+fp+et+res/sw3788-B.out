My voting experience I I well personally I've been very diligent until recent years When I felt my vote was absolutely kind of washed down the drain For the issues that you know that I felt really strong for uh I think apathy has set in to a lot of people because of the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run You really do have to study to get yourself uh up to par with what is truly going on and that takes a lot of research and and people today are very busy and uh and that is an excuse because we are we are always uh invo- I know I'm heavily involved in other things and and to take time out and uh study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time and I don't have the time to devote to that and uh you hopefully find that you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard And unfortunately they are not And uh it's really a dilemma uh that we find ourselves in I believe Uh So I kind of just have taken a back step away and uh hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there Take it because it is a task that is to me kind of overwhelming Right they just want to see how close the electoral votes are with the public votes Yeah Yes Well I know that when you're in a smaller community I live in Mesquite and uh when we have uh a local election say for our mayor and so forth they really uh give a lot of information in the local newspaper not in the not in the bigger city Dallas newspaper I mean they they just give it a small portion of the newspaper but the local newspaper really goes into uh quite a bit of history about the candidate and uh and then they have they raise a they raise two sides and uh there's a pro and a con side and uh you can really uh feel comfortable in uh evaluating that uh candidate by uh that method Uh I feel pretty confident about the way it's put forth Now I wouldn't say that about the larger cities though and the and the country on like the presidential Uh I mean they've got people that are running that are admitted uh criminals and admitted crooks You know I'm sorry but I don't believe in them turning a good uh uh a new leaf unless they have the Lord that has done that to them And uh without the Lord they can't do it
