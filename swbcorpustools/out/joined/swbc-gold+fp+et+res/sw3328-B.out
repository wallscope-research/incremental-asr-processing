Well they've uh statewide raises they raise ours it seems like constantly We just uh passed a new one uh fortunately or unfortunately it doesn't go into effect because we did not get the United Airlines Right And uh we had passed a a provisional one that if if it did if they did locate here we would raise our taxes But uh at least we thought we'd get something back from that Uh how do you feel about taxes Oh I've never seen taxes really go down Oh I hope they put that in writing I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and uh that the rich are not paying their share and of course the poor can't afford it either but uh I really feel like and and I feel like you know I'm a middle class person income wise anyway and uh I get tired of supporting the whole country You think the rich are paying too much Well I don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to I mean I'm talking about the really rich Right Now I'll go along with that You know Right Now I think that would be fair And I you know no no ifs ands and buts you know no big elaborate laws that say uh you know call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review It's just you know you make this you pay ten percent If you make a hundred dollars you pay ten percent if you make a million dollars you pay ten percent Our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal And uh they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate So and and you withhold no matter what you do they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough Right so now you know when you sign your W-Four form or whatever W-Two whatever that is then they always say do you want a extra amount for state Which is ridiculous but it's been that way for the last probably ten years Right unless you have a lot of deductions But you know if you have a lot of federal deduction it ends up hurting you state wise And you end up owing you know you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal and you're going to owe fifteen hundred in state And uh it's it's just ridiculous But I I don't know I've they just came up with a twenty-five percent increase on personal property in in Oklahoma county and that is a chunk I mean twenty-five percent increase
