Um I I think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together Um I think uh like in my situation today on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together my husband's been off doing his thing all day today and I've been off doing my thing all day and I haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning So uh Um two years It's it's really hard hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and uh you both have hobbies that are different you know if you have hobbies that are the same then you know you can enjoy your hobby together but my husband and I have different hobbies No no he's a record collector and a Hot Wheels collector Um so he was off today uh looking at at records So uh and I was off you know doing you know hou- household type things You know laundry and um did some shopping and stuff Uh-huh Yeah I I think I think that would be the ideal situation I think that would be the ideal situation I think that a lot of people like in my case I I do shift work I don't I don't have that choice Um I have to be at work at at X hour you know at just at at a certain hour and I can't it's not flexible Um it it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours and and maybe after we decide to have kids I I might find a job that has flexible hours I woul- I hope so anyway Um but I would I don't know Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah I ideally it wo- it would be nice to be able to just have like back in the old days you know back like whe- when I grew up you know the the mom stayed home you know and raised the kids My mom didn't go back to work until I was in junior high school Um so she was there pretty much all my you know formative years And that was nice and I liked that and I would hope that I would be able to give that to my kids But I think with the way the future is um economy wise I don't think it's going to be realistic I yeah I I think that I think very few spend quality time I think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff stuff like that I think that um uh most most kids that I see don't really they don't really value quality time Until until they're older and then they look back Oh really I I think kids now a days are raised on T V I mean that's that's almost like a surog- T Vs a surrogate parent And not a and not a very good one at that Um I I hope to of course be able to teach them right from wrong I hope I hope to be able to spend um their growing up years being in the home you know not having to work Um and being able to do I I I know a lot of people wh- who um um I work part-time also and I a lot of people that I work for are mothers that stay home Um and they they do a lot of volunteer work and they're real active in the community and um they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working And I'd I'd like to be able to do that I'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids Yeah Yeah but I think that's for the the few and far between I think that uh probably ninety percent of the of the um parents out there are are probably working parents And  I + I don't I don't really see that that trend changing much if anything I think there's going to be fewer and fewer uh single income families Yeah Exactly See I I never I don't even know what day care is really all about because I I never went to a day care center I never I never had that kind of experience Yeah I I see it seems like that's that's a big trend you know in the last ten years Day cares have have have popped up and become a lot more um a lot bigger part of of the kids' lives It's like a home away from home for a lot of them Yeah I I think yeah I think this is a good closing point Well it was really nice talking to you Thanks you too Uh bye bye-bye
