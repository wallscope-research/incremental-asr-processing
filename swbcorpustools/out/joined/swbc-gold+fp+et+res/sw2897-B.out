Um I'm I'm relatively satisfied with the benefits I have I think that um our health insurance is terribly expensive I'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money But um you know that's that's my major complaints I guess What about you Uh-huh Or or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't Yeah I + slash error I  see slash error Now we I have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered but what I found recently is what they've been doing is they they poll somehow the area and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code And so recently when when we had a claim um they didn't pay the eighty-five percent they paid much lower and when I called they said Oh well that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area And I was really surprised because either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code so that you know two doctors could balance each other out or their you know their statistics aren't very accurate listen Yeah I would assume that you know whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in But it's it's difficult What about other other benefits Are there others that you're dissatisfied with Well you have vacation I mea- Huh Yeah I'm not familiar with that sort of thing but you know to me vacation is is an issue and I mean different places have different amounts of vacation I would assume And um you know the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay perhaps or um <> I don't know I suppose um sick days Some places count the number of hours and some places just sort of believe you Um ours is based on number of days and you know people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill Right But um otherwise I'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here <> So maybe that covers the topic then Uh-huh Uh-huh Or maybe a ben- uh not really a benefit either but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls Um but you know I suppose some places are are more stringent about that than others And and maybe arriving late or something like that you know how how they enforce the rules But other than that I don't have much feeling for for the benefits since like I said um I don't have a big problem with with them Uh-huh Oh I I didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation Oh I see Uh-huh uh-huh I suppose that whenever companies can avoid um benefits it's to the to to the benefit of the company and at least you know financially in the short run but I would think they would get a much greater turnover and that people would be dissatisfied working for them slash error Right slash error I mean sure the payroll is lower that way but I would assume that the productivity is way down also Uh-huh uh-huh That's right No I agree Well thank you for calling Bye-bye Bye-bye
