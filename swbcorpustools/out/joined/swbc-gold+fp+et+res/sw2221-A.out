What do you think about uh the way the criminal justice system handles trials Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Well I think the six is called a Grand Jury and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial Whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused of you know and held over for trial Yeah I don't know I I think that uh I know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked However Yeah It seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it you give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong or for you know if if if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off much easier than twelve people could Uh-huh It's not so much that I that I haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges What bothers me is that uh they really don't mean anything Someone could be sentenced to thirty-five years and yet you know the the parole system it's going to let them out in in three years for good behavior No it's not Uh-huh Oh I think they're all overcrowded They've uh I think I heard Fort Worth that uh they've been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowded They're not allowed to accept any new inmates Now what are they supposed to do Well no I mean they're not allowed to accept any new inmates So what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail You know There yeah Uh-huh Something that is working and I I really like the system of house arrest where a a someone's wear someone wears a bracelet like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor and they are not allowed I mean th- some of them are even allowed to work they can go to their regular job they come home they have to be home by such and such a time they're instructed uh so that this this electronic monitor is turned on at at a certain time and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts/ And uh they can put a they usually install a video monitor in the house and when the parole officer calls to check on them they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it So that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they're supposed to be doing and that's working rather well That's a good system That allows people to actually continue to be productive members of society while they're you know paying back for whatever crime they've committed Oh yeah yeah Uh-huh I I've really I could go on for hours about the criminal justice system and what I think we ought to do about it But Something that I really don't understand is when someone goes to jail and they have a job in jail and they work that they should I and this may sound cruel but I do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes I mean they're in jail for crying out loud What do they need cigarettes for Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh I think that's a wonderful idea More than that More than that I know The thing that the thing that gets me is that while we're supporting them they're working When they get out of jail they get handed all that money That really ticks me off I think that while they are in jail and they are working their wages should go like I don't know they could some percentage like eighty-five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board figured on a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year And when they get out they should have a I don't know you know some reasonable amount of money to start like a couple of thousand dollars but there should be a limit over which they that it all goes back to the State Anything that they've earned while they're in prison should go back to the State except for that you know there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with Exactly absolutely That's the part that I really think we need to change Has nothing right Absolutely Yeah Uh-huh I think it works much better if it's if it's the actual jury Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah in some cases tha- it would work that way In some cases it would work the other way The jury would would slam them and and I think that that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time Uh-huh Yeah I think that's probably a much fairer way Yeah Yeah It might be more it would be more work for the jury but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it The thing that I I don't really like I I don't know if uh a lot of jury selection processes that I've seen have been a
