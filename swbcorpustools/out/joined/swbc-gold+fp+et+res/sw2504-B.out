Okay Well uh do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote Huh Uh-huh Well Well it uh there's no question it does make a difference Uh so far as having a party and then all voting uh when you have different precincts you would have to have a party in every precinct Because people have to vote in different areas and uh not everyone votes at the same place Uh I personally think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up with the idea of the the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference But Absolutely Absolutely And and they are are doing that in a number of schools However probably not enough of them uh country wide But it's going to take at least a whole generation of people uh to get across the idea of voting Uh just like it's taking a whole generation of people to finally uh realize the harmfulness of drugs and uh hopefully to uh now with the many programs throughout the country on how to resist taking drugs How to say no to it and what have you That uh perhaps we'll finally get the youth weaned off of it But uh I know I I spent thirty-four years in education here in the Dayton area and in nineteen fifty-one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana giving away their heroin <> and what have you to get them started And you know that was in fifty-one That's forty years ago that it was already a problem So it's now uh to the forefront and people are finally taking some action against it And the thing we've we've neglected the value of voting And uh and what it really means to vote and we also don't make the uh the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them Uh-huh Sure Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Right Uh-huh Right To complain about it right Right That's right That's right Tha- Yes Uh-huh Yeah I it's the same way with everything in education though It should begin and right down in the first grade Uh and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first second or third grade So that the children develop good learning patterns and you have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning uh and not wait until they're in high school and then it's too late to try to change them around at that point But uh everything should be started on the lower levels and uh certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that you know they they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant and uh but it but you're right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians And perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run uh that only the most wealthy can do so And they're not always the best person for the job But they have the money to be able to do it So uh so that there are a lot of problems along that line also And perhaps the Government Sure Right Uh-huh Yes Right That's right And I think you know that's an excellent idea They would put them to realize that that their going to have to do what someone else says even though they didn't vote for it And that maybe they need to think twice about voting Now some people object during primaries having to declare a party whether Republican or Democrat and you do that in the primary Uh and I don't know that uh a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason Uh they can declare anything they want and they can actually rig it If they really wanted to vote Republican they could go in the primary and say they were voting Democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat But uh it's uh it's just a sad situation and uh I do think more needs to be done along that line to help to uh teach the people uh uh everyone uh more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting So that uh we can make they're making some more intelligent decisions And it's going to take these young you know it's going to take the uh a whole generation of my feeling uh before that's going to be accomplished That's right Uh-huh Yeah Right Uh-huh Sure Right Well sure it is Uh-huh Well just the just the opportunity to try the voting machines yeah Right Yes Uh-huh Good Yeah Sure it is Absolutely
