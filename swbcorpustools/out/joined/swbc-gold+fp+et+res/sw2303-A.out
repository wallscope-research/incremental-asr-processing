All right we need to discuss the voters On a national and a local level Why do you think the apathy exists I blame it to apathy Why should I go out of my way when it doesn't matter Oh I think so too And I think the other thing is the news me- media puts such a blitz on it that they we- had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting you know And I I think the you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news and by time say you get off work and go to vote You feel like it doesn't make any difference Due to the overabundance of news we have available to us What do you think on the local elections though Oh I think so too Absolutely Uh I think another thing and uh I'm making a judgment here that may or may I think it is totally wrong well I think that the people that are have um a lower income which you automatically equate with lower education tend not to be registered And they don't register and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today they say Well I would and I believe in this but I had an interesting comment one time a thought that would never have crossed my mind I had someone tell me that I will never register to vote because I don't want to serve on a jury I just I they I just wandered off from that one I was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection So they wor- if they don't vote they don't have to be on a jury There is convoluted logic for you Yes Oh I just right right There are so many other ways But that one it just defeated me I didn't have any answer for that one That one was just beyond my imagination That's a good point you're probably right Which And that was what I was thinking exactly about because in the Soviet Union they had an election and they had what like a ninety-eight percent turnout A massive turnout At last someone wants us to vote They were standing in lines to vote And their vote didn't count Or any one shows up Total indifference you know what difference does it make Back gone the full circle Oh certainly there's a message there Even if they lose Oh and I think women turn out to vote for women too Yeah I thin- well I know it's true You see a lot of that You know rally behind the female She may lose but by golly we're going to make a statement here you know Oh okay Was was that the time no that was eighty-four that's too soon She said something about uh Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did and she did it backwards in high heels She said that I didn't Said you know don't tell me what women can do I think I did vote for her as a matter of fact I'm pretty sure I did Well and some of the issues are so emotional You know some of the really the really emotional ones Have you followed the Dallas elections on zoning I everyone has made so many statements I don't live in Dallas county But I've heard so many statements that I've lost track I honestly at this point it's it's just too blown out of proportion for everyone You really even the news You cannot follow what the sto- the actual facts are at this point I don't I don't really know if some of the poor judges that are trying to decide how it should be divided I wonder about them at some point That's correct And that's and that's another interesting question Should judges be elected or appointed Are they politicians Sure Or you want to take the other side of it you can argue that's one of those you can pick either side and we could spend a lot of time on it because it's it's difficult It's situational really Uh uh Oh Um Well this is true this is true I was worrying along the lines of you get every time someone puts in a ballot in a ballot box a dollar bill comes out the bottom That might work in some places
