Yeah I might as well Uh one of the things I'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh uh issue Uh I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of fre- different types of freons and that uh rather bothers me that uh I was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak Right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive uh they could be made uh you know inexpensive and lots of it uh and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work So Well course there's a a tremendous number of refrigerators and fre- excuse me refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve and of course the new cars I guess starting with ni- nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems But uh there's you know the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera And that's got me very you know highly concerned that uh that's going to be quite a while before we can uh undo this Now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion So so I see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting uh compound Because as I say there's a there's a tremen- well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator and then do you know that number and then how many a a freezer separate from and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning I mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks and uh the only reason I didn't uh get into that more when I was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree and I mean so uh that's why I stayed in stayed more towar- towards uh uh and that's a pollut- polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with with water and uh <> really make uh make a mess Uh-huh Right Well most most most of the time when you see bus uh you know the busses with the diesel that's uh those are carbon particles and carbon dioxide and water vapor uh because when you when diesel is burned it's it you know diesel fuel is burned in a in the diesel engine it's burned so completely that you don't have any uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil is uh is not very volatile You know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone Diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily and it's got well you know it's latent heat is high but it's slow burning at at uh normal pressures That's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio and so if the car sucks in uh fifty degrees
