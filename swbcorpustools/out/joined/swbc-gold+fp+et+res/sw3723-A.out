Ok I was watching the soap opera awards And uh it is really making me want to exercise because every single woman in the audience is uh about ten pounds So Uh I started anchoring last + uh anchoring uh exercising last about last Spring when I uh joined the President's Health Club And I was really motivated and going and uh I went uh for a little while uh I went pretty regular but it is hard to go regularly for a long time And where I live in Waco uh they do not have anywhere here that is affiliated with President's so now I do not have a club and I am uh I do not have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly or something like that so I am not exercising at the time at the moment So I wish I could I wish I did have the motivation to get out and do that but I just do not like just running with no where to go I just cannot do that So Uh-huh Uh Yeah Yeah I think a lot of the times if you have someone to uh work out with or walk with or something it does give you that motivation And you can also I mean you can you know pretty much do it privately if you had your own private uh sort of contest You know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that And that would keep you going Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah Uh-huh That is very true It seems like you walk quicker You just perky is a good word for it when you exercise And I understand that walking is suppose to be the like the best exercise Better than running Things like that cause it it works everything and it gets your breathing up and it doesn't yeah it doesn't hurt you Like I understand running hurt your shins or knees or something like that So Wow Wow Yeah Uh oh I guess my my favorite exercise in the uh in the gym is the bikes To go yeah there are these stationery bikes that you just ride and if you watch television they usually have television in there or something or if you listen to a walkman it is pretty it is pretty okay Again that is sort of weird because you you are not going anywhere and uh I use to play racquetball and I really liked that because you know to me it had a point You know uh there were points you could you would make and there was a point to it but running and jogging and just not going anywhere is just I don't like that I just can't understand that So I don't do Uh yeah Uh-huh Yeah I know a lot of people just to be safe like you were talking about walking at night and in the morning or early in the morning Uh you see a lot of uh mostly older people though but that uh walk in the malls You know like early in the mornings and things like that I have never tried that I don't know You know I have never even thought about it really Uh Oh Uh-huh And that is a little less
