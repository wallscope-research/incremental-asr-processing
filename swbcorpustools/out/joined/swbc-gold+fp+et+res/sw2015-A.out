Have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and their either offering a service or they're introducing some new product in the area and normally when they call you're either in the shower or you're in the middle of cooking something and you have to stop everything to run to the phone That was the big one I'm talking about I work weird hours and invariably just about the time I'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall And you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the cli- as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on or you hear somebody all ready starting reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already I've even had some of them the they're voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything What I would love to see done to stop all of this we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted and I think a law should be passed to where any of these people I think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them That's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door either religious groups or people peddling products If I wanted their products I would have either gone to the store to bought it or I would have called for their salesman to come out Now I agree with their right to uh pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but I think they should also respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment I'm on my turf if I want them there I'll call for them otherwise I don't want to know they exist Now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting I've even gone so far as to put that I've got a storm door on the front of the house and I've put in I don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting I should have I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise cause I still get I wonder if there would be some way we could get these people to do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers slash error with utt2 and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it would be harassment But I consider an invasion of my privacy a harassment in itself I believe we've pretty much summed everything up I'm drawing a blank Uh pretty close to it Well I've enjoyed talking with you And take it easy now Good night
