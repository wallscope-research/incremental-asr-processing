Wonderful touch tone telephone there Uh haven't have I have a wide variety of of hobbies therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide Um I get a charge out of uh TEXAS HIGHWAY which is uh very colorful and uh not being a native of Texas but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh about the different areas of the co- of the of the state by reading it Oh yeah it's it's uh absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things It's pretty pretty neat <> Um oh I like photography um magazines I don't take a subscription or anything like that Um things oh being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of a lot of uh building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines and and uh kind of strange because I it's not unusual to uh see uh an engineering manual or something laying around the house and then I'll sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it but uh How about yourself Oh that's great Uh-huh I bet that would be rather interesting Uh that's uh self improvement that's that's alwa- well that's kind of a hobby but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing uh Um well I hate to yes I do We uh we have these classes we attend uh management classes and and they give you books and and the last book uh matter of fact I read was AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht It talks about uh who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments Uh one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is Uh so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer Your my customer I'm your customer sort of thing Um every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the uh in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of Pat Hagerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type Which all you know betters yourself Uh-huh Like what for example Sure Sure How about items like um THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER which used to be a big okay So those are self improvements Um our supervisor uh subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW By a man man named Doctor Bittel B I T T E L <> and it's a very layman's uh uh approach towards managing different types of people And the very last chapter {A and I haven't figured out why that one was last } is how to manage engineers So it's it's ver- it's interesting here again it's it's casual reading and it's not eaten up with a lot of uh mechanical stuff and it's really excellent fast reading and uh but as you say it's it's sometimes it's difficult to to know if it's you know I think if somebody would say hey read these ten books because these are self-improvements I would probably be turned off to them If he casually just walked into it and uh put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested Yeah they're uh quite uh they're hard to set down because it's so interesting and of course they're all just a little spookier than the movies but uh it's always they're always challenging to get through one of them I have a hard time finishing books Uh-huh In quality especially now days uh that's almost everything that comes across the the the airways Exactly exactly right Yeah we we have I think we we name drop it a little too much and and don't fully understand what what it is we're saying I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and and all that kind of rolls in together there but uh that's just kind of part of it Uh not that I can think of Um I think I'm under my quota a little bit I need to probably make a phone call or two Uh this is true I've enjoyed it Have a good day Bye-bye
