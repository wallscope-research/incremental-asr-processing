Well I saw um lately I've seen SOAP DISH Which was a and that was a lot of fun It was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things Yeah Yeah it was it was okay It was not um not a wonderful film but it was I mean it was it was cute but not the biggest laugh I've seen I saw THELMA AND LOUISE A couple of days ago and really liked that Actually I saw it twice because I liked it so much And it's very it's really disturbing but a good movie Well it was um let's see The um it's it's different it's kind of it's an action adventure kind of you know shoot 'em up kind of film But it's with women in it instead of men so that's kind of a that's kind of a twist on the normal thing And it made me think a lot about you know you would applaud Bruce Willis in DIE HARD if he was doing this but you might not be so you know so encouraging of Susan Sarandon and then Gena Davis when they do it So that was kind of interesting I've but I really enjoyed it So I w- Yeah that's kind of what it was Right They had started out with that then they got into lots of trouble Uh-huh Yeah I also saw that Madonna movie It's TRUTH OR DARE and that was pretty scandalous Yeah it was kind of yeah Madonna she's pretty trashy And so it was it was interesting Righ- well I think she kept saying that uh they talked about her it it was a film of her concert um tour she had taken through all all around the world And they were all to her at the Vatican city and wouldn't let her perform in Rome and she kept saying that her show was not garbage It had a social message to it and Right We never quite believed that so I thought that was pushing it a little bit but she She is She's rich she's smart at what she does She knows how to do that Yeah What did you think about DANCES WITH WOLVES when you saw it Really Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Right I know I was I wondered if uh the tribes that they represented the tribe that was the the evil tribe if they were really as bad as it made them to be Right Uh-huh Yeah but I wonder I thought the- because they made a big deal about how this this film was such a big leap for the the people who who were the ancestors of the this Indian tribe and that you know that was so wonderful that they done that and they uh uh I wonder how the ancestors of this warlike tribe if they were offended by the film if it you know you didn't hear any press about that I thought it was a very interesting movie Right Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh I know the Well that's good That was that was it was it was good I looked at my watch only a few times which is a good thing But it put me in a really it put me in a really bad mood I don't know why Yeah we di- there were three of us who went We were just all grou- really grouchy when it was over So we decided that may be the mark of a good film It made us think And so we were grouchy We felt guilty for being I know and we we had nothing to do with it We were not responsible but we still felt the thick blame for what had gone on We could have Right Uh-huh Yeah Well Righ- I do I'm just out of school so I've seen a lot of mo- don't have a job so I shouldn't go see movies all the time Um I rented a good movie um called CINEMA PARADESO which is an Italian movie which is probably the best movie I've seen ever It was just wonderful It's uh story about a little boy in a Italian a little Italian village and he um owns a um or he works in a a movie th- theater and it w- it helps the projectionist There's a little oh an old man who's the projectionist and he befriends this old man and then it just tells about their friendship that lasts through all these years And it's just I mean if you don't mind reading subtitles I thought I had to kind of get beyond that Those little you know reading the little words at the bottom of the screen but um oh I just laughed and cried and I really loved it That was a a great one And other than that I No I had- I hadn't I had read um THE LAST PICTURE SHOW and but that's out on video now and I haven't seen it But I was interested in reading TEXASVILLE before I saw the movie Did you like it Right Uh-huh
