Yeah I wasn't in Central America but uh talking about Latin America I kind of I consider Latin America to include Central and South America and I did live in uh San Polo Brazil for four years Uh realistically I yes I don't see the the Panama Canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not not really big enough to uh accommodate the the shipping that it once did and uh maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however I think we're certainly justified in uh our actions dealing with uh Noriega in this Uh-huh No I haven't I have a a little bit I can't say that I'm I would be an an expert on on the region but uh certainly uh I it it gets it ge- there your you've got this this toss up betw- or not not so much a toss up but a a dilemma when when you want a country to have its its um own uh dominion or its free rein over its its own people And then on the other hand uh the uh the government in power that under what seem what seems to be popular support uh the Sandinistas had to a given extent popular uh support um starts making overtures to the Soviet Union And and into what we consider our sphere of influence and now we're we're in this dilemma over uh United States is believes in democracy and and self determination where a- but that on the other hand we believe in self preservation and uh agree with the or not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about uh infl- Soviet influence in in what's considered to be the United States sphere of the world which is not only you we used to see spheres but now we're in a situation where the United States is looks like we're it now Uh-huh Right Well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his uh his family Yeah well yo- in looking bu- if you look at the region in in uh to their detriment they came from uh this uh hundreds of years of Spanish control and the and the Spaniards have uh horrible history of corrupt uh government greedy uh rulers who have been uh manipulating manipulating their public for their own their own good I mean if you go back to the kings and and the the conquistadors coming in and and the hor- incredibly horrible things they did to the uh the native tribes I mean they make uh they make the things that Custer did look like uh like trivial And uh you get Oh absolutely and you know we set up An I mean Ted Teddy Roosevelt didn't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for uh for nothing and uh Right The only the only thing I see about Cuba though is uh after Fidel Castro dies I don't think they'll be a communist power anymore I I can't see communism in that country carrying on past him Yeah Right Ye- well I I don't know if maybe communism is the right the right word for it but what we would there would have to be some kind of there there may be a point at which at which you've uh you might want to consider some kind of socialistic uh organization or socialistic set up to to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy Right right But cocoa leaves sell real well right now it seems yeah Absolutely I don't it's going to be hard to um we if you you that that's where your absolutely right is we've got to do something in that region to encourage uh or  to make to make him growing bananas profitable again I mean Right I've got to watch what I say here I never know when the D I A may be uh listening on my phone Right yeah it's tempting it's got to be it's got to be horribly tempting for those those peasants Yeah yeah you it's not it's not just a matter of uh of having an extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of of feeding themselves their wife and their family and and you there's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family and there's dishonor in not being able to do it and No no Uh-huh Right
