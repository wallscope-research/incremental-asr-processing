Well I own the company I'm the president and C E O of the company So uh I guess uh I determine what the benefits are But uh so what are you asking me what what benefits I think are most important Um I'd say in today's economy besides basic benefits uh such as um health insurance and life insurance and the some type of retirement plan I'd say that uh most of the employees uh um that we have really like a a profit sharing plan They like to participate in the profits of the company like they're you know because they feel like well we're contributing to it so we'd like to participate in it and so that means I make a little bit less but the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in in it working Right I think most people uh don't want money um it's been my experience most people want uh to feel like they're participating in something that uh that is not a drudgery you know that they enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of Right Yeah well uh our people get a lot of satisfaction Um we're a financial planning firm Yes You said you retired I just happen to have a person that I happened to do some planning for this morning but anyway uh uh we do we deal with a lot of people that are retired or trying to retire and uh it's real important uh that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that where they were that uh uh that it take care of them They don't none of them really want to be rich but they like to have enough to be comfortable Well um we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a a salary is uh is tie um uh a percentage um of business that uh that a person would participate and bring into the company Uh pay them uh based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary And the re- No not necessarily Um it can be in-house people who help you handle X amount of dollars Right well see we have dif- we have marketing people and then we have financial planners and uh then we have uh staff secretaries and administrative assistants and these secretaries and administrative assistants um you know if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company they they can get very dissatisfied very quickly And so uh we're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle So administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business And uh Well and and but to see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to or that they usually have several people they report to that you know that they work together with it encourages them not to uh complain when they realize that they get a part of the of the action based on their efforts and not based on being sitting back saying well make me do it See we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it I don't think anyb- any I think most people want to be lack of better term- terminology they want to be self-employed but they don't want to take the risk In other words they like to control their own future but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please without some real strict adherence which that's what we have
