Well my home at the moment is an apartment Yeah I work here in Germantown but I live in Pensacola Florida So I own a home in Pensacola and uh let's see we are to compare homes Correct Uh my home is well is typical for the area I live in a development {F uh } it's a relatively I would say well God it sounds like sounds like I'm bragging But it's upper middle class uh kind of an environment It's a two story colonial which my wife and I designed Uh it has around thirty-two hundred square feet Uh five bedrooms and so forth and so on and it is I would imagine in terms of of size and so forth it's relatively typical for the area It might be I would say it's probably midsized for the area There are some smaller and there are s- you know several larger And uh but based you know in terms of you know in in Pensacola in that area of Florida it uh it's what now it is uh probably ten years old Yeah And so it's in terms of cost and and and size and so forth it uh the hou- you know housing there is extremely affordable and uh compared to other parts of the country you know let's say compared to Maryland that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars but I really haven't I really haven't uh when we built it ten years ago it was it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars So I I would have really I haven't really priced you know in the market so I Uh-huh Uh-huh I thought that was on the upswing again now Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh Well Pensacola has it's really is a buyer's market there now And it isn't because of the well there has been a lot of speculative building Uh I don't know perhaps not in Dallas but uh I'm sure people in uh you know in uh Galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it uh Pensacola is a Navy town And home porting was a possibility a few years ago They were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy a new carrier was coming in and uh the uh attendant uh support vessels Well that's no longer the case Oh it's it is I mean the the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population And so i- overbuilding is i- has been a real problem there So you can still get a get a a good house for a very very reasonable price And I mean good I would let's say typical say three bedroom uh two and a half baths on a half acre or so of land uh <> reasonable construction would probably run you uh right now anywhere between somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars And probably perhaps cheaper depending upon the neighborhood What about your home Uh-huh Uh-huh Nor do we but Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Well the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious And in in the entire D C area I'm I'm  only about uh twelve miles or so from the uh border of Washington D C and Montgomery County Maryland is probably one of the most expensive places to No we are west Sevren is east near the eastern shore if I had Uh-huh Oh that's not unusual yeah Well that's that area over there is not as expensive as in the the immediate you know Washington area And so we uh I was just looking for example there is a uh condominium complex next to the apartment complex where I live and I was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium And ninety-two thousand dollars for a two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment Now it was very nicely done I would have thought Yes I I can't I can't envision spending that much money and on on something along those lines So you know it's y- I guess you pay the piper but Plus the the the taxes around here are phenomenally high Uh for the and so you on that it's not unusual for example for somewhere around here on a on a on a what we would you know what you described as your house and what I would describe as my house say for example in Pensacola Florida on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes May- maybe you know maybe a little bit higher than that now but that same house here you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year taxes on it So it's uh so the question of whether to buy here or move to another county say drive twenty more miles north buy a condominium for approximately uh the same price maybe a little lower but the taxes would be you know perhaps maybe one-third uh of Oh absolutely Yeah so it's it's really sad This is one this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country Well they it <> the their they do have an extremely good such things as extremely good school systems for example It has one of the best school systems in the country Uh and because the cost of living around here is so high public employees make great salaries around here I was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the Montgomery County Public Schools makes a- an- and I'm not this is uh the figure he makes eighty thousand dollars a year That's and I by administrator I I think I mean I they didn't they did not define it but for example a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone you know in that uh in that range
