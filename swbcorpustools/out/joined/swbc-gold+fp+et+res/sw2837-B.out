Sure uh I'll offer anything that I can on the subject Uh my husband and I just bought a just moved here recently and uh we bought uh this house about uh I don't know year and a half ago What we have here now is just a basic three bedroom two bath brick house which is uh completely different from what I had had before When I was working and before I married uh I lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and uh historic old houses and things like that so I uh tried to I was in the process of renovating a house and uh that was about seventy-five years old So uh it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled jacked up uh new plumbing new wiring wallpaper paint everything you can think of that house had to have Well I I really did enjoy it uh you know it was amazing what I found out I could do on my own if I just put my mind to it Yeah Uh-huh It is It is Yeah That's that's true When uh I met my husband he was living in an apartment at the time and and uh the town that I was living in only about eighty miles from here So uh you know I we really it was just the market was so good we hadn't really planned on buying and as you probably heard from the in the Dallas and Texas area period the housing market is just unreal I mean you can get things for such a song So that's that's really why we ended up in a house like this This is not what we you know what we want to stay in forever because I have to have my I've found that after doing this other house I have to have my hands into stuff and you know I'm always just wanting to paint and and wallpaper and redo and redo so uh you know I I'm ready to get ahold of another one that I can have a little more input into so Yeah That's that's the key you know the thing is uh when we moved in they had just uh painted wallpa- we're you know wallpapered new carpet and everything so I feel sort of uh you know like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now and do it over just because I'm in the mood to do it So uh we'll see we'll see how much longer we're here Uh-huh Oh Oklahoma of all places Yeah Uh-huh Right Oh yes Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah Oh it is yeah Uh-huh uh-huh I see uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes yes Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah Uh oh That's where I need to go Exactly Yeah Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh Work right right Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh my word Oh no Oh my word For forty dollars Oh my Uh-huh Something Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Oh how fun Oh how nice Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Oh I bet And what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way Yeah but but you did stag- stagger back and say oh doesn't this look nice Well let me ask you when you laid those bricks I know my parents bought a house about ten years ago they're fixing to sell it again but and move again They're kind of my mom's like I am She's a renovator a lover of old things and you know they have to be doing something constantly And the patio that came with that house uh was not laid on a like I don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something un- on on top of the sand and then lay the bricks But they have they have a problem with these little tin- like sand bugs or something that drill in between all these bricks And of course you know you have the uh the weeds that come up in between the bricks or and things like that Uh-huh Yeah I see Okay yeah Uh-huh As tight as you can That's probably because they had you know every spring my mom says we're going to have a par- a barbecue and tell everybody guess what we're going to we're going to redo the patio you know we're going to pull up all the bricks but uh they just they just haven't brought themselves to do it So Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah Right Right well the thing that's funny is they've done uh they've done things like that you know I'll catch her out there spraying around and then it's like in two days time they'll come home from work and those little things are back It's just they're the most resilient little characters and so I don't know what they're finally going to do She may just hopefully they'll sell the house and go somewhere else And then she won't have to worry about it What are these things Right Yeah what it what it is that'll that'll take care of them Yeah Right Oh that's true That's true But my my dad farms and you know she's always telling him isn't there something that that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray you know out in the out in the field that you can get rid of these bugs but uh It might it might do it yeah She's got so many flow- she's got just a gorgeous yard so many uh flowers and her her four cats you know so she's sort of uh real funny about what she sprays Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I know I I was just you know it just seems like I as I said when I heard the what the subject was I thought oh gosh I haven't thought about uh what I went through at that other house in so long I've been so busy But uh I don't know of everything that I did I guess I enjoyed probably wallpapering the most and I thought that would be the hardest thing to do But uh gosh you know I ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house uh up the stairway even You know I just had a ball with it it was so much fun Yeah And I've sworn up and down my mom's uh my mom's great grandparents had this huge Victorian house in Paris Texas and the one thing that she ended up with is was the old door that was that was on the front door of that house and she has that up in her attic and I have sworn that it I'm going to find a house to put that door on before she does So as far as looking toward the future you know that's my plan I'm going to have to move fast I think though because uh you know as a
