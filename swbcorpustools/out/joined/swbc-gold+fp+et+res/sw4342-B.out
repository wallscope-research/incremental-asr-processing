I almost never watch T V news I get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio Uh it's a local radio station It's called uh K L I F cliff No No Well this has this station has a lot of just ongoing news and occasionally in the morning I'll pick up something like uh C N N or that but I hate watching the like ten o'clock news or Yeah we have a lo- well we have uh DALLAS MORNING NEWS which is the big paper in Dallas We read I read it pretty much from cover to cover The TIMES HERALD went out of business here and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one Fort Worth newspaper Uh financial trouble Oh when did it happen I guess they closed down about three months ago So how do you keep up Yes they're very voluminous So there really is only one major L A now Yeah I used to read TIME magazine a lot but I don't read it much anymore And then we have a local rag here in town that I pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community Because we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the DALLAS MORNING NEWS Now they have started here running a three day or three times a week Plano section And it's just sort of a you know four or five pages that covers what's going on in Plano But it's still not an awful lot of news Oh I would imagine in uh you know in in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the sub- suburbs and of course they tend to cover the county and we're not in Dallas county so they tend to ignore places outside of the county Yeah
