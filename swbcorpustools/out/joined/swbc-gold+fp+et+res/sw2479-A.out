Okay do you have Yeah There okay Had to mess with my phone here Um do you have children Oh okay I have three Yeah Yeah uh do you work Okay Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh no kidding Really Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah Uh-huh Because there's Yeah It's like a family thing Yeah Oh good Oh good I was just going to ask you how it you know if you liked the the but obviously you do or you wouldn't have him there I know but Uh-huh Oh gosh Right Wasn't the same Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Was it Yeah Good Oh good That's great that's good Well I got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years My oldest one is ten and a half now or she's I guess yeah it's was about ten years So I yeah I I was really happy that I was able to do that But I that's what I wanted to because I uh you know I just couldn't wait to have kids and so if I was I was so anxious to have them and I couldn't wait to have them it would be kind of silly you know to go back to work as soon as I had them so so it it it it was really great By the end of the ten years I was really ready to go back to work and my youngest was only uh two and a half I mean she was already two and a half so it wasn't you know she wasn't an infant Yeah Yeah Yeah so I felt real good about that but uh boy I tell you with summer coming up I'm just pulling my hair out in terms of what I'm going to do I I guess I went back to work about a year and a half ago and uh I worked full time all last year and now I'm going to school part time and uh graduate school and I'm working part time And so I'm still Yeah I'm still going full time but I only have half time salary and uh when school lets out I just don't I haven't I have no idea what I'm going to do because I certainly can't afford what we did last year which was Well we did we tried we had all different things we sent them to camp One first month in June they went to summer school then the second month they uh one my daughter went home to visit my Mom for a while and my son uh went to camp and there we had uh I don't know some forget what else we did but it was all uh really expensive So now they're a year older and I my daughter's eleven going to be eleven this summer and my son will be nine and a half And so I'm not I think I can leave them home for a if I can work part of the day you know I'm going to leave them home Right Yeah Yes in fact I'm doing that right now with their afternoons when they get home before I do You know that's okay But the four year old now I hav- I have had her since I went back to work or before I went back to work really in a home day care situation and uh we've just been really thrilled with it too We were what actually we it took us two or three different people to find Yeah Right But I wasn't embarrassed to shop around you know so the the person we found it through the there's an association here in town of professional home care providers or something like that In Plano Yeah and they have a number you can call and all these people are registered with their association and you know go like our our uh I don't want to call her a baby-sitter she's doesn't like to be called that care provider Right She goes to seminars and uh she gets home visitations by the s- I don't know the state boards I guess some of them and then some by the association and they have weekly meetings and everything and so it's just really really well regulated And she's just great In fact uh she's all upset because Galen is going to go to kindergarten next fall and she says this is it you know I'm not going to have her anymore and I said Oh no don't count on that After noon classes she's going to be here because she's going to morning kindergarten So but we we've tried we've tried everything and one year I guess last year when I went back to work I had my son was eight at the time just barely eight and uh we put him in Amrein's Day Care after After Well that's why we picked it because they were were supposed to be real great and you know I think they were fine but the thing is he was in school all day in second grade in in Plano it's open classroom situation where they don't have walls so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders in the same area with no walls And uh and then he'd get on the Amrein's Bus to go to Amrein's and then there would be a whole ton of other kids all in the same room you know you know what fun they had with these computer games and then they'd go outside for awhile they had snacks and story time and everything But it was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able to get home at two thirty Yeah Because he was always around with a crowd of kids and he just really missed being able to be by himself and having some peace and quiet or you know Yes Yeah Right That's exactly it So another thing that we tried to do I I know your son's too young right now but we're trying we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and stuff like that and Yeah Right It is It is And Yeah I bet yeah Uh-huh Un- understand Yeah Oh my gosh You're kidding You're kidding Oh that's great Well good for him Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well that's great That's so good Uh-huh He's out of there Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Good Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh my gosh No kidding She knows something right that she and Yeah that makes such a difference That's the way it is at my daughter's nursery school too And I think that really makes a difference They're in it because it's a profession not because it's a job they could get because they didn't qualify for anything else you know Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Because because Right Some sometimes that's fine that's great you know Sometimes it isn't You just have to Well is it real expensive then Uh-huh Wow Yeah Right Right Uh-huh Uh-huh No Yeah Uh-huh That's exactly it See we do the same thing since Galen goes to nursery school we pay our our home care provider for our day care provider full time for a whole week but she she's gone three mornings Galen just doesn't go there three mornings a week But I said to her I said you know it doesn't matter if for whatever re- when school holidays come around I used to have such a problem with that They wouldn't have anything to do I'd either have to <>
