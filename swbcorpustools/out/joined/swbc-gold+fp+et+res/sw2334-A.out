All right Uh-huh Um I wish I had Well I it was done for me after a while I had a uh I had a business going And this was back in the eighties I don't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that But uh I had a coin shop and everything was going great while gold and silver was up and it started falling So I started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards and things got worse and worse and finally boom Yep Yeah it was I ended up going into bank- you know it was one of those things uh Oh it'll get better next week you know Things will pick up And so there I was in old bankruptcy court Oh yeah Oh yeah yeah I was buying from other dealers and uh you know they take payment any way they can get it Yeah Course on on stuff that I was on merchandise that I was buying on cards it was I was getting the money back because I was selling it I wasn't buying you know just to hold onto it Uh but it was things like you know rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up So Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Yeah That's the way they suck you in Uh-huh Uh-huh Well just today in the mail I got uh I got got my guaranteed acceptance by uh American Express Yeah Yeah as soon as you're a graduate student they get your name And uh course I guess I guess I've been purged from their records I used to have an American Express Uh back when I had my business I got one And they they goofed up bad on my fir- on my very first bill because I was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses And the bill would come in and I'd pay it And the very first bill I paid it and then I got this nasty letter from them saying You're overdue pay So I said Well it just crossed in the mail So I didn't do anything about it Two weeks later I get another letter even nastier and said We're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you don't pay And I looked at that and I said Uh-huh So by this time my checks had come back from the bank So I made a copy of the check that they had cashed attached it to their letter and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying Thanks but no thanks Yeah they were I tell you They don't talk about they're charging that enormous fee every year It's up to fifty-five on the gold card It's eighty-five for the Optima Or I'm sorry no fif- no fif- Yeah for the green card Well now that's the card see Oh yeah yeah It's um well of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isn't any But on the Optima card it's um let's see right now it's running at about It's not too bad It's actually it's about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good as far as credit cards go Well they're dangerous Huh-uh Mine don't either mine don't either They uh my mom has a uh has a MasterCard and a Visa card and that's it Yeah Yeah now I I do use gas cards Yeah Yeah exactly Plastic is just too easy I mean that's the that's the whole problem with it Um Yeah Sure naturally That's I got into all kinds of trouble doing that Well slash error Having having been out of the credit game for some years now I've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it sd And uh Well it is but I I I'm kind of uh grateful for the experience because it's taught me a lot of restraint Yeah exactly I I uh I just went out and got a new V C R yesterday with cash And it it's No I wish I did Yeah I could use a discount I have to wait for things to go on sale Yeah especially on electronic goods especially now Circuit City Yeah they they're not their prices aren't that terrific They they used to be but they've gotten they've got to pay for all that national advertising now Uh-huh Yeah they're they're all over the country now They they used to be good I remember when they first opened up They did have good bargains I don't know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar We call it Service Merchandise You got Service Merchandise Yeah it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go And uh Circuit City came along and that was the place to go to get your T Vs and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that And then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price and actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now So So much for Circuit City I don't I'm a graduate student I'm a professional student It is It's great It is great I love it N C State Uh North Carolina State Not yet Ours don't ours doesn't start until uh next week Where am I What do you mean where Oh in Raleigh Little the
