Okay Well uh just briefly Uh I worked in a nursing home so I kind of know from way back uh how things used to be run and I think there has been definite changes of nursing homes but I think uh if I had to personally put one of my parents in a nursing home they would have to be pretty bad off to where I couldn't take care of them at all It would be something that you know I would certainly if they're forgetting things or whatever I'd prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care where somebody comes in and they cook meals and they clean their house for them that kind of thing so they still have their own independence and not reliable you know they don't have to be in a nursing home situation But uh I don't think the nursing homes when I was working in them were very much understaffed very much uh in need of good personnel Uh I think the patients weren't given the quality of care that I wouldn't have you know I look at it and say thank God I got out of that kind of situation But they they were not given the time and they were not given the money basically to staff appropriately people to help And I can remember lifting a patient all by myself simply because there was not another person to help It's either le- leave the patient in bed all day long or get them up and I would have preferred to get them up than to leave them in bed all day But uh uh so I think nursing homes are have changed I'm not quite sure but hopefully they have Uh-huh Yeah Sure Uh-huh Sure Yeah I I think that's that can happen and I think in the nursing home that I worked for I wasn't quite sure of it but I'm sure that some of the patients were uh given medication to keep them in uh quiet and and Yeah yeah And they would just lay all day long and uh the ones tha- they also put mentally ill patients in the same they were not on the same you know ward but they they were in the same nursing home so that these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other uh older people that were in there for reasons of uh you know age uh the mentally ill patients could walk right in into the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically Because if you weren't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing they could they had freedom to just walk around and a lot of them were I think there was a couple that were schizophrenic and I remember one time watching one of the uh schizophrenic patients actually go out on I don't know what they call it a binge or whatever you want to say it she grabbed a hold of this and it was kind of funny when I looked back at it but I mean I remember the patient getting very upset That woman actually pulled uh the other person's hair I mean she just came up right behind him and pulled his hair you know and it was a guy that was just really upset I mean he said what the hell are you think you're doing you know and I laughed at it then but then I'm thinking God you know if I had to put my parents in that nursing home I wouldn't want them there So I think there's laws now that kind of protect That nursing homes either have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people and not in the same type of facilities even though they're aging mentally ill they are still mentally ill and a lot of these older people have their you know they're not insane or anything like that They don't have these tendencies to to lash out But seeing that kind of made me think twice about jeez I wouldn't put my mother father in that nursing home at all A small town Yeah yeah I don't know I don't know I I kind of look at it this way I think if you have a big city area I think there's more people to keep watch on it And Yeah yeah And you have more competition And I think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community And this is back in nineteen seventy-seven that I worked there and I look back at it and say jeez you know i- it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there But my grandmother uh later on got cancer and uh could no longer well actually she
