Yeah Jonathan uh you s- you say it's near and dear to your heart Buying a car is uh something you're contemplating I take it Uh Uh-huh Uh <> Uh-huh Wow They get Uh-huh What do you think you'll uh what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I think the next car we get will probably be a well I I like Buicks We have a Buick Century now it's a nineteen eighty-seven and uh whatever I get I want to have uh air bags uh both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to you know rather than have them stoop down to get over so I think the four door is probably a major requirement and other than that uh you know reasonable cost and safety and uh as much economy as you can get out of a car Uh you know I'm not looking for one with a great big engine uh something that will carry it around careful I guess is best best way to describe it Right now we've got a V six and it that seems to be just fine I know they s- they're coming out with some V eight now and I think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age Uh-huh Right I uh I drive a a truck a Ford truck I I like trucks because they're spacious and it's handy to haul things Uh it's not related to my business I just really use it basically for transportation but there's so many occasions when I've had to move some members of the family or do this or that and it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one Traction Uh not really uh you know it's a two wheel drive truck and I figure if it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive I probably ought to be home anyway Wow Uh-huh What kind of what make is the mini van Mazda I see Right One of my sons has a a Plymouth uh van or you know uh uh that same type of thing the Voyager I guess and uh they have a a child that's five years old and it's really handy for hauling him around and and their stuff and of course as he gets friends I'm sure that will be even handier So I know if we were if we had kids still at home we're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value What about uh all wheel drive Is that something that you'd be interested in or is that Uh-huh Uh-huh Right
