and she's expecting the end of this month and she's the only one that lives near by So the rest live in one lives in Connecticut and couple lives in Pittsburg and one lives near D C So uh Yeah Yeah Yeah we see them once in a while a couple of times a year at least and the ones in Pittsburg of course we see more often So uh All right I'm ready to go Well they've been trying different things One one of the biggest problems seems to be we don't they don't have anyplace to put some of the things that need recycled Right now we've recycled glass for ye- be- years because we have a glass industry in our community Owens Owens Um so glass has been recycled for a long time Uh we have a cycling area set up here at our house the Boy Scouts have and they've done that for years Uh the stores are recycling their plastic bags now You can take them back in and they have bins to collect those Uh the aluminum cans They try to do the uh newspapers and uh they had to close their area down because they couldn't sell it They were what they were doing was shredding it and trying to sell it to farmers for bedding for their animals and that type of thing And that didn't work but but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw Which is why they couldn't sell it you know because the farmers would buy the straw if it's a you know similar price And let's see is there anything else Okay I think by this Fall it's going to be required that the town of Clarion which we'll live nearby will have mandatory recycling started so Uh mainly the glass the aluminum the plastics Uh Well we're working hard on it because we're fighting also in our area a large hazardous waste incinerator which we do not want built and uh we would like industry to do more before they build these big huge incinerators And uh we we just feel they should they should offer industry some incentives to do more reducing of their waste products and reusing them because some of those companies that are doing it have save money eventually At first apparently it costs more to get started But once they get established then it's a money saving thing And what is T I Oh okay Gee my my son works for no not for that okay Excuse me go ahead Well my son works in uh for the federal government He's he works in a computer laboratory And uh it was through him that that uh Uh maybe you could tell me what is the difference between office paper waste and just like newspapers Um Oh really Um Um Yeah Right yeah Right yeah Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well it would be inconvenient to in other words to Right more areas where they would pick it up Yeah Yeah Um uh-huh Oh well Knox is just over the hill here Yes uh-huh They they no longer are you know active Yeah Oh for heaven's sake Yeah Oh for heaven's sake Well we only live probably about fifteen twenty miles from Knox Yeah uh-huh I'll be darn yeah Uh-huh uh-huh I think people are getting more interested and they are more concerned And we're just we're just real concerned about this incinerator because we really they want to put it right in uh in between two of our main water sheds that feed the Clarion Ri- River And uh we we just we just don't want it anyplace We feel that we that they should give businesses more incentives to do more recycling and more reduction and and more reuse and all those things that could be done We we just don't think we don't think some of the politicians are really interested in our best interests And uh it's it's been a real struggle and a hardship for a lot of people in our area that we've have you know have been fighting against this thing in trying to have things changed to make them more more right but uh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Right Right Uh well We're we're going to pay for that that whether we pay industry or pay we we've already paid industry for like these super fund that's cleaning up We paid industry for it we pay all help to pay to have them haul it away from their place and where they put it now they found it's not a safe place It's leaked and now they have to clean those up and it's our money that's cleaning this stuff up And now they want to put it in they burn it and that will make another hazardous dump and eventually they'll have to do something with that We'll pay for it again so why not pay industry This is my feeling Why not pay industry a little more and reduce it you know and and not have as much of it Oh definitely Huh-uh huh-uh No but they think and probably they're right people buy it easier Yeah yeah And I know people would be willing to do more like saving their newspapers and that if they had a place to take them We don't have anyplace right now that will take them Uh-huh Probably yeah
