And good Well well today uh when I got up it was twenty-nine degrees Yes and it managed to get up to about fifty this afternoon but it's been cloudy overcast and threatening rain all day And we've also had extremely strong winds fifteen to twenty miles an hour for the day Is that right Oh really We had one of those two days ago But not uh but uh no rain at all yesterday and uh no rain today Thanks a lot Cu- couldn't you send us some nice weather Oh was it Well the one thing's for sure we can always discuss the weather how some ever we can't do very much to change it What's that Oh yes well that's about the way our weather is here also And I grew up in Saint Louis and Saint Louis was much the same No it's not This is uh about uh ten degrees cooler than usual But about a week ago we were up to eighty and eighty-five degrees No no it uh it fluctuates from one extreme to the other it seems I'm sure I didn't I was ready to turn on the air conditioning It no it really was extremely warm It only got down to about sixty-five in the evening We had about three or four days of that and then all of a sudden a cold front came down and uh temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short length of time And uh it has gone down gradually each day This morning it was twenty-nine yesterday it was about thirty-two Uh cars were scraping ice off their cars this morning if they've been sitting out all night So it it really wasn't too wasn't too pleasant Oh I hope not Well they are predicting rain and thunderstorms and I wouldn't be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had Uh yeah Yes warm rain well of course by the time it gets up here it may ru- run into a cold front coming down from Canada Yes Yes We had uh a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the uh of the city of Dayton itself And uh then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in less than an hour It was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal of lightning So it it wasn't uh it wasn't conditions to being out in it and I had just gotten home We had a lot of tornado warnings also And I had gotten home shortly before that uh the rain started So uh I felt a little more secure that I was at home rather than having to be out driving in it Is that right Uh-huh Yeah Oh they that was ca- very very fortunate for them because that could have really been disastrous Well of course this is tornado season uh in to uh we have many tornadoes spawned in this area And northern Indiana now we're in the southwestern part of uh Ohio just forty miles north due north of Cincinnati and uh but uh northern Indiana has many tornadoes come roaring across And we get the backlash off of it if not the part of the tornado itself So uh we you know we get a lot of bad weather in this area But of course you're supposed to be the sun belt and I do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion Um-hum Right Yes I was going to say that it does make a difference when you're not accustomed to uh having to drive in it Right right And Right Um-hum Right Well uh well here what they do and I I contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do they spread salt And of course the salt does melt the ice but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes uh a perpetual problem Oh it sure does do that Well sand and uh but I have learned to do is uh now that I am alone is uh to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car Um not only in case I need it for that for traction but for additional weight in the back of the car And then of course kitty litter is also excellent for that I don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of that but yeah Well Well the dogs don't use litter But kitty litter is excellent for uh getting under the wheels of cars and what have you and giving you traction Uh-huh Yeah it uh works out uh really quite well Course I have I have a dog also My son brought me a little Lhasa Apso uh for my birthday last Thanksgiving He brought him from Dallas He Yes that uh he just thought I had been without a dog uh for three years That was long enough He he had Oh a what Now that one I'm not familiar with Uh okay Okay that makes sense then I believe Yes right well I've always had big dogs before Never had a little dog before And Yes well Oh well I had a German shorthair that was frightened of storms The minute it would begin to storm he would just panic And uh I had to push him down when he was fourteen and two months later I had to put my yellow Lab down because he had leukemia And uh then uh then there was no point in having all my acreage I had four and a half acres with game preserve on three sides Oh well it was great I loved it But then I didn't need all that anymore so I finally sold that and I'm in a fair size condo And I have a nice size patio And uh so this little dog has plenty of room to run Yeah and he is a a cutie and uh but I've never had a dog I had to keep taking to the groomer's to have groomed either And it's Is that right Oh is that right Oh well I was there once way way back in nineteen-sixty I think for just a week's vacation But uh I that's about the only time I've been to Florida except passing through on the way to someplace else But uh Uh-huh Um-hum Well uh uh most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in Florida But uh I have just that's just not been my thing We used to always head west or head north Now that I'm alone why uh I uh prefer to travel overseas if I'm going anywhere And uh course there too you never know what the weather's going to be When you start getting over to Oh is that right Um Yeah Oh is that right
