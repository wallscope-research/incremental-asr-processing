Yes I have a Macintosh S E thirty Uh-huh What do you use yours for mostly Uh-huh Well I do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base and uh about the only thing I am uh I'm just starting to get into uh a little bit more communications now I've just today ordered a fax modem so I'll be able to send and receive faxes right over there without using you know you don't have to make a hard copy that way Uh are you using windows Uh-huh Uh-huh Well it's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh Uh-huh Well the one thing I used to use a uh I've never used an I B M actually I used to use a just an Apple two E which of course is looks pretty primitive now But I don't have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh Mac right now I don't have uh any compilers so I'm uh I use it in my business I uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh English as a second language programs That's uh exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing I'm working with exactly You seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that Uh-huh Right Well now we uh what I use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though Most of the stuff that I do is not uh interactive and I use it for t- uh data analysis on testing so Well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh You know when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort So it's involves a lot of spreadsheet use Well I was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly and with smaller files I can't believe you know I've got uh five uh megabytes on this one now and on my two E I had a hundred twenty-eight K Yeah Oh the old the old Apple uh the the original Apple had what yeah forty-eight I guess didn't it My goodness Uh-huh Uh-huh Well the S P thirty goes up to eight but I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet I think probably when I get system seven I may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk I don't know They say that system seven uses a lot of memory
