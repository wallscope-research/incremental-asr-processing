I drive a Honda Prelude Oh yeah I bought mine a year ago so I'm not buying a car any time soon Yeah Yeah It Well I I like where all the controls are they're they're in good spots and I I have an automatic I can't drive a standard Why weren't the 2 indep clauses split up into separate slash units  Yeah But um I it's an it's supposedly real reliable the only thing I've ever heard about Hondas is that the breaks go out first Yeah Yeah I had a Buick Regal Yeah The Buick was was great It was nine years old and it was still going strong The only problems I had with it in the nine years that I owned it I had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old And that was the only major problem that I had I mean I had like little piddly things like I had to replace the muffler and I had replaced the tires and uh seems like it had a radiator leak once But I never had any major anything other than the compressor Huh-uh Well I never well I kind of know how to drive standard but I've never owned one so I hadn't I don't drive one a lot So I don't feel comfortable in traffic with it And for everything I've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic And and resale value is really important to me Yeah Yeah I did pretty well with my uh Regal because it was in really good shape but it still looked real nice the the interior was still really nice there wasn't cracks all over the dash board and stuff And it had some some nice features So I ended up okay with the Buick and I anticipate the same thing with the Honda whenever I decide to sell it of course I may never sell it I may drive it until it's dead but Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Well Uh-huh Yeah Oh I wasn't even looking for a car when I bought this car I uh I was thinking about buying a Prelude from a friend who was moving to New York or something so and she was going to sell her car because she didn't need it anymore and it was only like a year old and I had never driven uh a Prelude So I went to a dealership because they had like uh the same year and same model of Prelude on their used car lot and I went and I test drove it and you know I just fell in love with this brand new white Prelude uh you know two liter S I with the sun roof and the moon roof and I bought it loaded Oh Yeah I went there looking at a used car and two days later I bought this car I felt like I felt like that was the worst impulse that was that was largest impulse that I that I had ever made The oth- the two other things that I bought on impulse are a V C R and a washer and dryer I go for the big stuff Oh Yeah I got I got my Buick as a high school graduation gift Yeah But I I guess this wasn't really an impulse I mean buying it right then and you know right quickly was kind of impulsive but I'd been thinking about buying a new car for about three years and I was just scared to I was scared to start taking on payments because the Buick was long since paid for Buy a wha- ar- you buy a used car Sure Yeah Well um like on Hondas they supposedly the maintenance records was supposed to be registered with Honda or whatever and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff I mean they can't stop you from doing it Yeah Well and even if they didn't you can still get a good idea from a if you can get a good mechanic to check it over real carefully and check the block and everything So Okay Well I enjoyed talking to you Bye-bye
