Of a exercise program you have Right Well swimming is uh one of the best exercises you can do I mean as far as for uh cardiovascular and and it's least hard on your body I It's the least hard on your body as far as uh impact and Right right Well I do uh little aerobics oh three or four times a week but it's not enough to boy if I go in the summer time I try to jog jog a couple of miles and uh well you know even doing that three or four times a week when summer hits that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for uh half hour or so but so I'm not quite getting the level that I need to I like it I like it uh part of my problem is I have small children so uh to do a whole lot just requires a lot of oh coordination as far as scheduling and that type of uh deal you know uh when you're in college boy You got a hundred things going on Of course you got a little different direction going but uh Right you don't notice it as much yeah You feel it don't you It's amazing how uh how much uh it changes and I weigh probably about the same I weighed for oh I don't know how many years but uh it's changed places And things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same But uh so do you do uh in Texas uh does there probably quite a few facilities Do you enjoy it or is it uh If you can have find the time it's just the Yeah it is hard it is hard It's uh like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more Don't get enough sleep as it is right and uh kind of have if you're having the pressures of school and uh everything else it's kind of course it's really you know as soon as you do it it's really a release You feel invigorated and you feel oh you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods If I eat very much sugar boy just does something I do I have to be real careful Did you Makes a lot of difference Well there's a lot of fat in meat Right And unless you really like uh fish Fish is pretty good for you but uh Kind of see what happens I've tried to do that with sugar and it's almost impossible everything has sugar in it I mean if you go your ketchup has sugar in it Course and I like sugar too that's that's a problem but Anyway well it's uh nice talking to you Think we've uh covered all the subject Okay Well you too Good luck uh enjoy college while you can Let me tell you it's uh It's a little different uh challenge isn't it Where are you going studying Right
