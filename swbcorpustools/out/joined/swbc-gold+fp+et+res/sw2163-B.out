Okay Okay Ye- Yes it is It's one we all hold dear and near I'm sure Yeah most of mine's been pretty good although I'm I guess I'm like a lot of other people now I'm trying to to pay off my credit cards and and uh I've done pretty good at it Yeah Yeah Uh-huh there is a big difference <> Yeah yeah Yeah oh yeah I I do that I do that but the rest like I said the rest of them I've been trying to to pay off and uh get back on a cash basis except for gas It's too easy to to run into the gas station And Uh-huh Yeah yeah So Yeah well that's Yeah yeah Well I've been pretty lucky in that respect I don't charge like I say I've I been trying to to not charge except for emergencies And uh so but I haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards There's you know they have uh wonderful features they're there when you need them You know like in emergencies or whatever Yeah It's it's awfully easy That's true that's true I try to I did switch to one uh sponsored by the credit union though That seems to be a pretty low interest Yeah compared to some of the other ones And you don't have an annual fee there and that helps Uh-huh Yeah that's one way to do it because that that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well I'll just pay on it this month and Yeah Takes a long time that's right And now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off off your income tax that's you know Of course it's been going down for a number of years but this is the last year you can take anything So So Well I've enjoyed talking to you Okay Bye-bye
