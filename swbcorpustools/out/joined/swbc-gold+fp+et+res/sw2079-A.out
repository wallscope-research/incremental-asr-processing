Okay I'll let you start first okay Well in my case my husband is not a carpenter but in fact he's in electronics but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it So it took him about two and a half years but uh he built us a house it's {F uh } we have thirty-two hundred square feet and it's a brick house and price-wise it was great because he did it all himself you know so that way he could we could kind of control in control it and uh we live in kind of a small town and I mean it's nothing fancy you know it's it's a house it's nice and it's real pretty and we're all comfortable in it Oh you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else You know But uh of course my husband did everything except my brother's a trim carpenter and he came in you know and did the inside for us and that helped And uh yes and uh we had to hire of course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing you know he did everything else We've been in it six years N- no we're well uh our kids are kind of still small now and we had thought before maybe a lot older we don't need such a large house that we'll sell it but he will not build a second one himself Because he says age-wise he'll never be able to handle that again Yes yes Oh Uh-huh Yeah oh Uh-huh Yeah But uh like I said otherwise you know a- the expense but you know we could not have one as large as we have if you know we hadn't did it ourselves Yeah I mean it's not an Eldorado house or anything like that but you know it's ours That's right That's right Ap- apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high Isn't it It really is because I I'm always shocked at about you know what they have it appraised at I think oh my goodness Okay and it was nice talking to you Okay bye-bye
