Okay uh I haven't I don't know that much about the possi- what the possible choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury but uh I think it works better than many other systems like having a judge decide I can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide although it's difficult because they all have to be new- unanimous I don't I don't know I don't know if I feel I don't feel real strongly about that If the uh the thing is though I I didn't think even if it was a lower conviction I didn't think that you could uh I didn't think that you really had to have a a jury Unless I guess if you request one you can But I think yeah making it unanimous sometimes might uh let the only thing it might let more people get off I don't think it would convict any more people And we have so many people already you know the jails are already overloaded Yeah Well if it's no but they they what if they never agree Doesn't it just uh do they have to go back and do a whole new trial or Agree <> Yeah and that maybe on the lesser crimes that aren't too severe that's a little stringent Especially because there's twelve The thing about it is I think jury selection too a lot of times uh the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury and they can sway them that way too I know I don't think well I guess you really can't but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either So uh but then again you know they the one of the questions they asked is should it just be decided by a judge and that's kind of tricky too because a lot of positions the judges are in they they can't be fired you know they have to they stay till they retire and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements too I know Yeah I think in some cases they are But they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is if it's you know so that's another thing where they have the power but maybe juries could be less than twelve people or would that be more fair or less fair Maybe there should be more than twelve people I don't I know I don't know That's true and I've never been on jury duty but they have to keep going and going and going And lose their not lose their jobs but not go to work It could be Really I've never seen one in real life either so I don't have you know I don't know that much about it but I think it seems that we have a a pretty fair system compared to other countries I don't know how we could make it more fair I really don't The unanimous vote is questionable though And and how how many cases get juries might want to be reviewed too Because uh I don't know if you should really have a jury for s- a small infraction But I'm not sure who gets them I don't know anything Right No whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty uh unique I think when they started it So how long do we need to talk Do you know Okay Uh in uh what do I do now Do you know Anything or just wait for someone else Okay well it was nice talking with you Thanks Bye-bye
