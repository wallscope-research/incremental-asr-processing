Well I'm in a I'm in an urban area I'm in Dallas And we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem uh even a more major problem Uh in Dallas some of the major problems uh drugs seems to be re- related to quite a bit of the crime we have now There is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with uh people trying to get money for drugs And uh I think that's a national problem though It's not unique Yes Uh-huh Well now we're pretty close to the golden triangle aren't you Right research triangle and all of that And uh I'm sure you have a lot of students there uh and a lot of researchers so you you may have a you know perhaps a little better economic climate but in all your cities now it seems like th- there is a a crowd that's really effected by this bill Really Really Um Well here uh I'm not sure how many Dallas has had I've uh Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four I I don't know A a number every week Uh Dallas is having quite a few Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or or like I say drug related Uh I guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values Seems like a a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to Uh I The economy is lousy Uh-huh Boy that really that really takes someone who is bold to do that Well now do you find that security is very good in in a in a town home Uh-huh Well that I see Yeah Well I think you hit on one point there is you know each other I'm I'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything Uh I am oh about three blocks off a major road and uh a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs I guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the the commercial districts and uh I'm over the northeast part of Dallas It's a in a nice neighborhood The houses here uh before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and course everything's down ten to twenty percent now But we have uh one one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away and now the economy is bad they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the uh they're not nearly as selective as they used to be And course that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex You start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so uh I'm sure that aggravates it also But unemployment now in Dallas or in Texas is up around six point
