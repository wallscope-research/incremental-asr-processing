Okay I guess its recording Um what kind of hobbies do you have Do you sing or knit or anything Okay I uh I started knitting awhile ago I knitted I didn't know even know what the stitch is called I just had this uh uh piece of yarn and I wanted to start something so I remembered something I learned I think when I was five years old So I kept doing that and now I have a little blanket but that's all I've done Uh Do you make sweaters and things or just blankets Uh-huh Oh I see Huh Uh-huh I probably won't make anything beyond this blanket I don't know why It's just too time consuming Um I like to sing I've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things like that Um right now my actual job is a news reporter But uh if I could do anything I wanted to do it would be to sing professionally But um Yes uh-huh I'm in uh I work for channel six in Waco And so I do little news reports and things It's not as exciting as it as it sounds But um No not much um my day is usually pretty full My schedule is like from nine to five thirty but I could be at work from anytime you know from nine until nine at night or ten or whatever so it's hard to make plans much less you know have a hobby And even if I had a hobby like knitting or something and I wanted to take it to work I'd probably never get to it You know so What do you do Normally Oh okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Right I show- I showed mine to my boyfriend and he was like you didn't make that Oh yeah it looks uh halfway decent actually first thing I did but Yeah How many children do you have Oh okay I hear them in the background there All right that's a hobby in itself A job in itself Right now I was just sitting here watching T V I was getting ready to fall asleep Yeah I sang at one last summer Um it was my first wedding I've done um little commercials and background singing and um I sang all through college and things like that but I really haven't done anything really professional per se But I did one wedding last year and uh I just now got some cards together kind of uh business cards that say singer and what does it say a song makes beautiful wedding or something and I've been passing them out to different wedding shops I mean when someone comes in you know for a wedding for a wedding dress and they they might ask about it This one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because I have a demo tape you know if any one wants to listen And uh she wanted me to bring it in she's going to play it on Saturday so that would be great if someone came and heard it and they were like I want that voice but I haven't got any calls yet but I only just put them out this week so hopefully I'll get some calls in Especially now since this it's spring and it's the wedding season I guess Uh-huh Yeah that would be great Then I could be getting paid for something I love to do Not that I don't like reporting but I'd love it No I've never I've never had uh formal training I've just been singing every chance I get I try you know in school and yeah choirs and um when I was at U T I was in a group called Ensemble One oh Nine just twelve singers and we did uh little conventions and um uh like dinner parties and things like that Sing pop music So that's what got me really really interested in it So I'm trying to be sensible sensible too at the same time Yeah exactly My parents would have a fit probably But uh I think I either have a call or yeah I do have a call hold on one second Hello Yes okay that's my mother on the other line I need to go but um I think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes are we suppose to hear a beep or anything Oh okay my mother said ten minutes so I don't know But uh okay well it was nice talking to you and and good luck with your hobbies Thanks bye
