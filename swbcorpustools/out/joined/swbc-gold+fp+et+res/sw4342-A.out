So how do you uh so so it sounds like you've got a television going on there so I can assume that you probably watch the T V news Is that Really Wow I Uh what what station do you listen to Cliff I see so uh it's not affiliated with anything is it Not it's not a network station Okay yeah because I I listen to uh public radio a lot and they have they have K C R W which I I I saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable TV outlet I guess They're getting a little getting a little feisty now Uh Yeah so you have a paper or something or Uh-huh Yeah How do you like it It's been it's been a while since I read the Dallas news I uh fact last time I read the Dallas Dallas news I was in Arkansas I uh Oh yeah Well that must be pretty bad So how did that happen anyway No not how I mean when did it when did they Yeah Oh really Um Oh me I uh good grief I read the TIMES LOS ANGELES TIMES There's quite a task if you've ever run into one They're uh speci- Yeah they're thick Uh if there's something you want to know it's it's in the TIMES  and then +  and  in detail repair bracketing wrong Uh they uh we we used to have two papers here in town and then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of oh I don't know just nobody was buying it really Yeah pretty much Uh there used to be fact I think there still is the uh the DAILY NEWS which runs out of the San Fernando Valley and uh they're not bad as far as a uh you know as far as a local paper goes In fact it was kind of weird because I met the uh I met the I met the editor uh while I was on uh while I was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time It was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff He was a really cool guy Uh you know went to Columbia University and all this stuff And uh it's it's a pretty good paper but uh you know it's not it's not the TIMES Although I you know I'm sorry to see some of their uh there's there's a daily news uh news rack right around the corner from where I live which means that they're they're expanding I guess But uh a- and occasionally I I pick up like TIME magazine or something I think uh if they've got an interesting lead story but you know it's I I don't have time Yeah that's that's kind of a problem for them There's a lot of people who fall into that category Uh-huh I see Yeah the big dailies don't like to don't like to step much out of their uh out of their home turf I have to admit the TIMES is kind of provincial too It's basically anything that's south of downtown they don't bother to cover Uh-huh Yeah I know I uh it was it was a big discovery when when the TIMES when the TIMES found out there was a place called Orange County I mean the way they I mean the way they've been handling it before they practically they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the L A county border Oh really Yeah yeah I I I find that attitude kind of arrogant though It's like you're taking our money but you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us
