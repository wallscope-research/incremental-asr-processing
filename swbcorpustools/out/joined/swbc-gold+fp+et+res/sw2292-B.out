Hi Uh-huh Well um I we just recently graduated from Rice University and uh we were going through a lot of job interviews and things and some of the things that were important to me uh when my husband was looking for his job was um hours you know we he'd been in graduate school so I was used to his not being home at all So I was you know didn't want him to have a job that would make him kind of be on call all the time and have to go in at any time and you know even on the weekends and um and things So that was important to me and also insurance for the fa- our family because we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it Uh-huh Uh-huh Us too Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that's nice Uh-huh that's good Uh-huh Oh I know We just went through that ourselves We just you know are like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things Uh-huh Yes Yes it's pretty bad Well yeah and we um we were interested in having dental insurance too because um having been in school we kind of put things off and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff and we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over and We have um you know we're at Aetna with an uh ex- we have like the medi- the dental insurance is separate Is that what you mean I don't think it's the basic I think it's the other one Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh No that's great Yeah we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too Yes and let's see besides insurance other things that we looked at um well my husband does not like to commute very far and and we don't like him to be you know having to drive an hour to work or something So we kind of looked for where where the uh his office would be located and well he's at you know he's at the one that's at um seventy-five at uh six thirty-five and so we by living in Plano we're just about fifteen minutes away Um especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didn't want him to let you know to like we had some job offers in the New York area and we thought well you know he would be really commuting and not only is it you know trouble to have to drive but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving And um so that was something that was important to us and because like I say we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long that we were anxious to do everything we could to have you know made us be more together and and what other can you think of another thing that you guys looked at and Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh that's true That's really important Um also what um opportunities there would be for advancement I think we looked at besides just you know what salary you would be having now But when when could uh your salary increase um is there was there somewhere to go Uh-huh Yes that we can make our mortgage payments and yeah that's really true Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh But we also were interested in um you know being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some opportunity for friendships that way so that you would feel happy going to work every day and Rather than thinking Oh I really I can't stand these people But so that's something that was important to him in thinking he could work under Oh just since last summer It's only been not even a year yet so Yes well Oh yeah You never know we're hoping that that won't be the case We I think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose um this area is that um my husband was raised in Irving and so he we have a lot of family here his side of the family And being when we were down in Houston we were isolated I mean it's not that far but people would ha- we didn't have anyone in town that was our family And although we had really good friends and we had church and school support and things um we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that So that really made a big difference I think in why we chose T I and chose to move this way Uh-huh Oh that's nice Yeah and it is I think it is important to you know want to be close to your family and Uh-huh Yeah that's the same way we felt We're really enjoying it I wonder what it would be like I mean I wanted to be close to family but I also thought it would be harder to be close to family But it's turned out really good and I think that you know we're really satisfied with that choice and we you know kind of felt like um it was worth it to us But anyway Well I my children just ran out the door so I need to go check on them Well I've really enjoyed the conversation And uh nice to have met you and you have a good day Bye-bye
