Ready to go Okay Right Oh I know it builds up really fast Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah we do With two a two year old and a three year old and so it really builds up with us Yeah Oh yeah That would be much more convenient Yeah Yeah Yeah Or it just builds up so often Yeah Yeah yeah They used to have several places um that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable/ So finally um they the people put so much pressure on the city they did a survey of everybody and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic um and put it in front of the Wal-Mart store in town and th- they it just really e- e- every time you went by there it was just over flowing/ and so Wal-Mart complained so they moved it behind the store and nobody knew where it was and so people kept piling stuff in the same place where it used to be Oh it was just like a dump there and so finally you know I called and the- they said you know it was behind there and I started taking my things behind there So we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly with two little kids and the paper but it just builds up it would be so nice if they had it you know at your home where you could just turn it in so they they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area in one neighborhood and they have pickup there it's uh I think once or twice a week And the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out so they had not much participation and they were going to cancel it but then finally people started getting the message Yeah and I think that you know if they can get enough going they'll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city but it's not I think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this and it's not going to be I don't think Yeah Yeah I do to because it's amazing how much you know trash we can generate I know this year we took our Christmas tree they had a place in the park where you could go have your tree shredded and they gave you a little um seedling to plant you know you could take the the mulch home with you you know and take buckets of that home so that was really good idea I thought Yeah Oh yeah it's really it adds up so fast Yeah Yeah Well they're working on diapers which would be great I've read so many different things about diapers and now their saying that e- originally they thought the disposables were just awful but now their saying that they're ther- really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them and you know all different kinds of things too so th- the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those off So I don't know what's the you know right thing to do but I really would hope that they would come up I know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable but the landfill have to do something special you know for those but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too so Yeah It does and you just feel guilty if you don't do something with them you know because you hate to contribute to the problem but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either Yeah I don't know what else they could recycle more of/ I guess we don't really use that many tin cans I guess there's some places where you can recycle aluminum but I don't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff in I don't know if those are recyclable or Um Yeah Yeah we don't either we usually use frozen vegetables and things so we don't really have much of that Yeah Well now when we lived out in California they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car or for aerosol cans and things like that because they say it's not safe to put those things in the regular trash Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah well other than that I'm not really sure we we try to recycle old clothes Our church has a place where you can take them and they you know pass them on to other families so Yeah yeah Oh Uh-huh Kind of like a Goodwill should this really be the end of a slash unit B's next utterance is left hanging as a result kind of place or is just a '+' if previous B utterance is "de-slashed" Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah that's that's real helpful too Well I'm not sure I can't really think of anything else that we could recycle Yeah Okay You to Take care Bye-bye <> <>
