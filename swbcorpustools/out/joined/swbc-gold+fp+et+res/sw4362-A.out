I don't know Uh I haven't it's been uh well seventy-nine since I was at school At high school And uh I've seen things change I don't know if I've seen things change enough that I can actually because I wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then so it's hard to compare You know what I mean But uh it seems like when I li- I lived in Chicago I I've lived down here I hear the dropout rates from the schools and I certainly see how much I pay in real estate taxes every year And I begin to wonder if I'm really getting my money's worth I mean I I've seen so many different things So so many different bad reports coming out of the school system and I recognize that there are good schools out there I mean somebody's getting getting a good education because we continue to employ people But uh I don't I don't understand the uh I don't understand I guess why the schools don- seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities I don't know if I blame it on the school I think I think I blame it I think I blame it on a couple of different things I think I blame it on the school system Uh Yeah I don't blame it on the teachers in the school I although I think that I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than well they do quite well for themselves No Not all school districts are well paid But there are some school districts out there that are very well paid I mean I know one family that's got they're both teachers and they both have like second jobs that they work in the afternoons They both work all summer full-time And from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each I mean that family is making over a hundred grand And I'm I mean okay okay Yes I agree that teaching our kids is important However these people who only work eight hours day at it from seven to three and they only work nine months a year and they get an awful lot of breaks in between and that's my tax dollars that I'm spending on that And I don't even have kids
