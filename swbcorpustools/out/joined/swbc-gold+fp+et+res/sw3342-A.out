not be a very good conversationalist on fishing I don't do a lot of it Well good maybe I can learn something Do you Well it is fun what little I do Of course I don't you know I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing I told my husband last night when I had called and they had told me that this was a topic I said well I can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm He said I don't think that's the different kinds of fishing they're talking about That's about the only kind I know how to do Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well it sounds like you do quite a bit of it Uh-huh Do you have a boat Uh-huh Uh-huh I think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas The ones around here are so big that you can fish off the dock but unless you have a boat you can't really get into the where they call the good fishing holes you know Is it Uh-huh My in-laws live on a lake uh a little bit east of Dallas kind of in the Piney Woods and the lake is beautiful and I like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish but actually catching fish to eat per se you don't really do much of that right there I catch a lot of little old uh I think they call them perch and then the the uh turtles try to eat up all my bait So it's it's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit but it's kind of fun Um I would be afraid of that Do they ever get on your hook Uh-huh Are they poisonous snakes Uh-huh Yeah I think I'd be a little bit afraid of those Uh-huh We uh saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws' place last year It was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know Great big snake and it of course it scared the women to death you know but the men come out and said oh well that's only a a king snake it won't really hurt you you know But it looked so bad and it was so big that it might not would have hurt us but we sure felt like it was hurting us just being there you know But they're scary looking Yes uh I think that uh probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else Uh-huh Now they have a lot of bass tournaments Uh-huh Oh no Uh-huh Well that's kind of we've never entered a tournament or anything We're not that big into fishing but I see a lot of people you know early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out and they'll say Well there's a big bass tournament this weekend and all those people are here for the tournament you know So I think there's a lot of people that have you know really I guess that you'd call it really sport fishing they're really into it to try to win My But it is it's very a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around The peace and calmness is really relaxing Uh-huh I've never tried taking a book with me I'll have to try that one of these days
