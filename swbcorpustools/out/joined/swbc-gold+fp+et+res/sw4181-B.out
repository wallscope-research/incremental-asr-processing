No I would tend to agree very highly I think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it Yeah we sure do Here in Indiana we pay uh we pay county income tax state income tax we pay five percent sales tax uh you name it they tax it That's right we Uh-huh Right Which is probably pretty nice but I'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high There's no sales tax either Uh-huh Right Taxachusetts Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh No I uh I really think that here in Indiana at least we pay a a whole uh just too much tax I worked in a factory uh last summer and on the average I was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes and I don't feel that I really get a whole lot of return from that I mean I don't utilize all you know it really any government welfare services Of course I drive on the roads and I you know went to the schools and stuff but I really feel that that I'm just getting overtaxed Uh-huh No that's that's not any fun Uh-huh Right Right Yeah which is just outrageous and a lot of it and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste Right Right Right That's right got to keep those farmers happy Uh-huh Right The- there is just way too much bureaucracy and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real you know good programs Right and a lot of it's feeding that Just I just I really especially in the election year I mean I'm really thinking a lot about this the economy and questions like that and and just the whole it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy uh the government goes and our our whole economy in general and our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens and especially when you've got the Bush administration who has increased government expenditures uh beyond what any other President since World War Two has done and yet he supposedly Right right yeah I mean I just read something that two thirds or three quarters I'm not exactly sure of our national debt are was created during the Reagan Bush era who are suppo- supposedly fiscally conservative Right Right Uh-huh That's right Yeah it's really that is the especially that defense cuts in the defense is really a Catch twenty-two double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well that's great that's going to lower our national expenditures but then you're going to have people on welfare and they're not putting taxes in So that's that's really it's I'm glad I'm not the one who has to come up with these policies Uh-huh Right That's right
