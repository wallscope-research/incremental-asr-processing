Well I I just last Friday got off a capital murder case Yeah I was on the jury Uh Yeah Which is funny because I got called last night and the topic was uh something about juries Yeah so I am just hitting it right Uh how do I feel about it I I don't know Well I guess it is right in certain cases Uh Becau- well the one I was just on I don't I was an alternate on the case so I don't know what was decided They are probably still in deliberations on it But uh what I found out once once I was declared an alternate and I was dismissed we met with the judge the two alternates did And uh he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy and I remember hearing about it It was about a year ago Uh he was he was involved in another one another capital murder the very next month and he was caught just they they drove up the police drove up just as he fired the g- gun and killed the guy So he was caught and uh it's interesting because the county I live in I'm not in Dallas county I'm I'm pretty far north of Dallas Uh county I live in in the past ten years only had t- two capital murders And last year there were six and this guy is indicted on three of them Yeah so you have to wonder you know Yeah Yeah although you know it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him You know he he has no concept of what he has done He just well from what I can tell I mean I didn't talk to the guy or anything but I mean he doesn't seem to have any regard for anythi- anybody's life including his own So it's it's kind of strange that you know No huh-uh Yeah Yeah well it's funny because when you know they interview you before you go on the jury and for capital murder I was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours And I the I was the I think the ninety eighth person they'd interviewed But you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt and I said I can't imagine I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he had done it yeah I guess I could convict him but I can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something But they really did It was it was really amazing Well that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about And those jurors don't know about But this particular case I mean they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that that the police hadn't released so no one else would have known It was it was really pretty interesting Educational Well they can't they can I think in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been he hasn't been found guilty of it Right Right so you know it's although it's not going to take much to prove that So Uh yeah this guy is up for the death penalty Uh and in Texas there is there is a couple of questions you have to ask uh in the punishment phase Uh for example was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation And there is a number of questions and just depending on whether you say yes or no uh you you can give him capital punishment and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment then you can look at mitigating circumstances So there is a lot of outs but the only result is otherwise he gets life in prison Yeah Right and and to me I mean you take away a person's freedom you've taken away most of their life Yeah but But then you have to look at reality I mean I think you know normally they they may get out so But what is it worth I don't know Personally I don't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself Yeah so you said you're from Mississippi And do they have the death penalty there Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Um Yeah Ooh That's right
