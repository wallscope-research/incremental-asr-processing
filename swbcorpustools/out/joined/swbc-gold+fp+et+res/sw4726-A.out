I'm ready if you are Well I think that people should be allowed to have them Especially if they go hunting which my son goes hunting He goes deer hunting He goes duck hunting Uh he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old And I just think that uh as far as that's concerned he should be able to have them to go hunting with you know As far as just having handguns around to to have them I don't believe that you should have handguns around Well no There's too many sports people out there that that do do these things Yeah well I suppose you could Uh Uh-huh And I think if they want one they're going to get one You know The bad guys are you know like I say if they want a gun they're going to find out somehow to get one Well I agree with you on that because I know uh in fact I had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time And for a rifle there's no waiting There wasn't anyhow Now there might be now But there wasn't anything for you know rifles and things like that I guess it was just handguns that there was a some kind of a waiting you know two weeks while they checked you out or something But uh most of these people that's got these guns that's going around you know robbing people and shooting people Uh-huh Uh-huh I see now I know they were having a gun show about a month ago and I was just wondering how that did work if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show There's no restriction though You don't have to wait or nothing then huh Yeah I was just curious you know because uh I know at at the regular gun show you know gun shop that you that you do have to wait for pistols like a couple of weeks and then they check you out then they call you up and you h- go pick it up Which I think they have to do on rifles and things now too I think there is some something like that Anyhow here out here in California I think there is now But Uh-huh Now we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that But like I say my son he's he's always had a like I think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old But he's always he went to the to the school to learn how to shoot it He goes to the pistol range and th- and the rifle range to shoot them He likes to go to that uh shotgun thing where you shoot at those uh yeah right He likes to do that you know But uh I don't know I think they should try to control it and everything you know But as far as just banning it completely there that's not going to happen Uh-huh Yeah right right Now I do believe though like in California if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has I think they're liable now for they can be you know put in jail and everything The whoever owned the gun You know now when they have kids around you'd think that they would be locking them up or you know Uh-huh Well they can get into almost anything anymore
