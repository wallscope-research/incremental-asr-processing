Yeah I have three cats and a dog Um Um we just got the the dog less than a year ago so he's still a puppy He's a mixed breed he's part Collie part Shepherd and part Chow More Collie and Shepherd than Chow the only Chow he's got is is his tongue Yeah He's got little spots on them Was the guinea pig for your for your child Really Oh my my husband's always wanted a Chow but I'm kind of concerned about um with having cats and how how they socialize with cats Um which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed Um because we thought they would socialize easier um my husband had originally wanted an and his brother has an and he so far he's bitten ten people So And the people that he got the from used to have cats and they no longer have any other cats So Uh-huh Yeah I wouldn't want to bring a cat into a full grown dog but I I wouldn't feel um hesitant about bringing a puppy in to adult cats I think they would socialize easier Um how how old is your child Five So you had the dogs before you had the baby Uh-huh Uh-huh What color are they Oh I bet the black one's pretty About your baby Yeah I think it's good for kids to grow up around pets as as long as they don't have any allergies to them or anything But I think it really helps them to understand when when they go to other people's houses and they have pets I see so many times kids just you know they mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings Yeah Yeah Huh Uh-huh Now ar- the the Cockatoos are those the big ones Yeah Yeah Are they Yeah Well we've thought about getting an aquarium partly be- partly for the cats I think the cats would really enjoy it um yeah yeah of course um but so far we just and starting up an aqu- an aquarium we we're thinking about getting a saltwater and they're so expensive to start up Yeah Yeah The the saltwater fish have so much more color and they're so much more beautiful Um the freshwater tank's just really to me they'll there's most of them really aren't that pretty you know I really do- I really don't care much for them Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah yeah Yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't dare have a a goldfish here because it would probably be in a small bowl and then my cats would knock it over I have to be real careful about where I put things if the cats will will jump up on things and knock things over all the time They're always up where they don't where they're not supposed to be that's just like kids you know yo- they know that they're not supposed to do it but they're going to do it anyway because they know they're not supposed to Yeah yeah and until we got the dog um it was real easy to to go to town for three d- three day weekend or whatever and now it's like a major production trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you're gone And I we knew it but we never even thought that about when we got the dog we just saw him oh he's so cute let's take him home You know and then the first weekend we had him we had we were in a apartment in a two bedroom apartment and my husband went out of town and left me with with the brand new puppy and I had to work twelve hours that day and so I left the dog locked in the bedroom and I put paper all over the floor Well when I came home I opened the door and there were chunks of carpet padding everything all over the place and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door Well I had the carpet fixed um I yeah I didn't even tell the apartment manager who got it But that that was my first real experience with with a puppy when when we had our family dog growing up I was eleven or twelve I think when we first got him and I wasn't really involved in the the paper training and you know teaching him commands and stuff so this was and to me a whole new experience Only it wasn't like cats at all So Uh-huh Uh-huh My cats do that it If I through anything away that's any kind of meat or anything like that anything that that they think is good they'll get into the trash and then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it and how how tight you have the lid down on it they'll get into it I've come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor And the cat's just looking at me like sorry I couldn't help myself Uh-huh Yeah the problem that we're having with our puppy right now he's not he's actually not really a puppy anymore he's like sixteen months old um but he's still chewing Um the last thing he chewed up was uh when we
