No we don't have the uh national public radio in in my area I can hear it at the uh uh oh the college town nearby when I'm in Stillwater which is about an hour away but the F M signal doesn't reach this far Uh I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit It gives you a whole different perspective on the news uh when you hear it from say a European point of view or from the country of origin Uh I agree with you too on the uh uh the cable channel C N N and HEADLINE NEWS Uh I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper uh which is why I rely on shortwave and and then the cable cable C N N I think a lot of it is just uh the fact that in the U S you're so far removed uh in a lot of cases from say conflicts or or it's not happening in your backyard so it's it's more of a it's not as a personal uh the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than than what's on shortwave It's B B C is uh oh I don't know the right word is is almost uh they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it and it just they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions Uh very much so very much so and I I think a lot of it is uh especially T V news they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to uh oh to really decipher the news and to really explain it I mean I you know I think it's important to interpret it but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to to do the interpreting Oh I like the straight reporting Uh and then I I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it It's it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it uh I always think it's humorous when when the President gives the State of the Union and uh for thirty minutes and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard And a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they what they write into it So I overall I think I would rather hear just straight reporting Yeah I I think people are people have that opinion They they want to sit down in front of the TV and uh or at a read a magazine or U S A TODAY and read in four paragraphs uh and and find out every-
