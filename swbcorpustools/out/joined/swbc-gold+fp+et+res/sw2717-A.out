I'll let you go first Yeah it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty Yeah I know what you mean Um I in Maryland they they do have capital punishment and uh I've seen uh a lot of people get convicted sentenced and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals Yeah what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years And uh here in Maryland I know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons uh just Yeah but I mean in here it's uh to the point where they were letting prisoners go Uh commuting the sentences of those that were in in jail for lesser crimes in order to put more people in into the jails And it was just uh amazing to me and of course they made a big deal out of the the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out and being rearrested an Uh I can't remember Refresh my memory Um I don't remember myself Um I think if they if they started executing them on a regular basis uh that I think it might make a difference Right now I don't see it making a difference I don't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death I mean most people out there committing murders don't care They just don't care Yeah Yeah yeah and there's uh there's a lot of people here in Baltimore that uh have and we just had uh a real big cocaine bust and of course you know they're they're playing it up real big that it was looked like it was a very very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy But I mean uh Baltimore has uh an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year I think they've got over a hundred dead already this year Well it's kind of it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that it it it uh there's I think X number of people out there that are going to commit murders and uh once you kill off a few of them I mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that I mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder Yeah Yeah Yeah you know it makes sense um you know you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but I mean uh so few and far between uh you know makes good T V movies and that's about it Yeah Yeah Yeah I had my uh my father-in-law participated in a uh a jury trial he was he was actually on the jury and uh this man was accused of killing uh I think it was two people uh and shooting a uh policeman um point blank in the face Of course he didn't die And uh this was during a holdup of a uh uh a restaurant and it came out during the trial that um they had tried to rob another place and uh when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple cookies and uh you know jumbo cookies and and so they were so upset from robbing this guy you know trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started you know shooting people You know it's Yeah Yeah and get even with who I mean you know stupid guys And uh it turned out that the you know policeman survived to the point that he was able to you know identify the guy And of course you know they tried to make the cop look ou- like he was uh a uh no good rotten drunk I mean it was amazing Oh he was found guilty yeah He uh um last I heard he uh he beat a push for the death penalty Now whether they finally got it or not I don't know I kind of uh stopped listening after a while Um you know he would come home and and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to dec- you know after he had to go Right And uh yeah everybody everybody was pretty much you know let's burn him And that's you know that's the way they wanted to do it And he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he uh you know some people on the case were were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but I mean when it all came down they just within an hour decided the man's fate Yeah Yeah yeah well it it it went pretty pretty quick from what he said But I mean there's there's there's a lot of other crimes out there I mean besides murder I think uh now if you're dealing drugs now caught more than twice or something uh it there's uh a death penalty associated with it Uh-huh Yeah yeah I agree Yeah I agree I I've I have uh a low tolerance for that kind of uh that kind of person And uh as far as uh you know there are some some other crimes that I think uh you know uh kidnapping um you know when they I mean kidnapping per se has a certain uh uh fine and penalty associated with it but um some of these people are just out and out brutal I some of the cases I've heard about over the years
