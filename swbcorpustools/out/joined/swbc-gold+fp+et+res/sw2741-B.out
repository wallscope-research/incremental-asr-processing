Okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well uh I probably a little bit older than you are so what I see uh is the change that I see the most is is that uh women have much more many more occupations and careers to choose from than when I w- went to college When I went to college you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or a secretary or but there were very few women in business at that time A few but they were the oddity And Yes And now I see and and I see for my daughter which is wonderful this she's thirteen and I see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from so many different jobs which I think is terrific Because I'm a teacher and I mean I love teaching but there I think there are a lot of other things I would have liked better And uh not that I would give the career up because it's it's a safe career plus because I always have a job plus I am a single parent too and I n- I need the income But uh and I think that's the reason why a lot of women have have started to work too is because economically it's just a must Uh you just it's very difficult to get along on one income unless uh the male uh has an extraordinarily good job And especially men who teach school they don't make that much money and and most all they always either have they're either moonlighting or else their their wife works too Uh it's just an economic need now Oh definitely Uh-huh Oh yes exactly We have quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents and uh the majority is uh married couple with children but still there's a lot more than there used to be And see you never picture yourself in a situation like this When I married I thought I'd be married the rest of my life And uh but I'm all I'm really grateful that I went to college My mother always said you know get an education in case you need one a- because my father died when we were I have a twin sister and we were eleven when he died and she had a nursing degree and she was able to make it But she said in j- you never know what's going to happen and I thank God that I did go to college and got a degree because otherwise I don't know how I would be able to raise my children Isn't that something Yes Yes Oh yes Yeah I do too But I think it needs to continue to change and I m- I think it there's still not equality as far as uh paychecks for men and women I think that the we still have a long way to go Uh-huh And I think that uh I think by the year two thousand it we're going to see some a lot more changes uh hopefully that women are you know able to get the the executive jobs and hold positions that men men do because they can do it just as well you know if they want to dedicate their most of their time to that they they're they can do it Uh-uh Exactly Exactly And I think that's the way it should be I think it I mean not that I I think that I'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that I could never do strength wise and so forth but also there's some things women can do like have children that men can't do So you know it I don't w- I don't want to be equal but I I want to be I want to get what I deserve and I want to be able to be on the same level with them If I can do a job as well as I man I think I should get the same pay you know And And I just I'm not a women's libber I really am not But I I think that that we have just as many rights as they do And I feel like if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then she sh- they should get the job with the same pay I do too Oh I do too Definitely Well it was good to talk to you All right Bye-bye
