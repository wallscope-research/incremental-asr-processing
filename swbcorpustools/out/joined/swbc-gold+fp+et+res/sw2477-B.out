Well I guess I'm a big Laker L A Laker fan when it comes to pros Uh the college ranks um I guess I really of course I try to follow my alma mater that's uh B Y U in Utah But they don't have much of a team usually Yeah yeah You see them in football on T V once in awhile You never see them on a on nationally basketball They uh last year they had a really good team the year that Danny Aines was there That was about five six years ago by now So they made it to the sweet sixteen once or twice in their history and that's and they usually lose in the first round  How about you Uh-huh Is it the Bulls you're talking about Yeah the pro Is that right Uh-huh No no So did you watch the uh final four this year Every game Right right Yeah I I watched that game and uh it was a good game It was a very close game and hard fought game And it just I don't know it looked like U N L V may have had more uh talent but as far as playing together as a team that day it didn't Duke seemed to have them off balance And that uh they didn't couldn't aren't they more of a running gun team Right Yeah fast breaks and things and They shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed and Right Right right They didn't have they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year and that and that so that's a terrible time to have to deal with that right in when it when it counts so much Right I think I think that that probably was the difference in that game Because it really could have gone an- either way Down to the end you know Well <> I don't know Probably not Since Kareem's retired they haven't had a center And uh they've got Perkins but I don't think he's really been a super star for them Yeah Right right So They'll make it you know i- i- it it's going to be a war between uh between Chicago and uh and uh uh Boston Celtics That's going to be a war It's going to be a great series Yeah One of those two will probably be um in there um let me see where does Detroit fit in Uh-huh So I don't know those three uh Detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year Uh-huh Yeah They have the they have the play-off experience but so does Detroit I mean so does Chicago So do- all three of them do with Larry Bird back uh you can never count the Celtics out when Larry Bird's starting to click on all cylinders They say he's starting to do starting to play Right Right Right Last I've heard is that he's starting to peak right now He's starting to be more consistent you know right at the right time of the year Oh any dark horses I uh you know San Antonio San Antonio is the dark horse that could could really flip in there I think Yeah He's got to be pretty much you know I use to say Akimo Lija was the dominant player you know when he against any team he would dominate but Robinson's getting up there where every game he's just I mean it looks like he's going in for a dunk and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back you know nobody's got enough beef I guess to challenge him when he's when he's driving hard to the hoop He's uh he's too bad the Mavericks couldn't get him With Roy Tarpley they're in big trouble Yeah for awhile anyway I heard he was suspended Because of his Um If they did they'd still have to pay his contract They may have done it It was a lot of money He was making like I heard on the radio it was sixty-three thousand and change a month That's what he was being paid you know he wasn't even playing Oh boy what a good job he had He ruined his sweet position Yeah I'm looking forward to the the pro play-off uh L A yeah San Antonio who's the other one that's doing so well this year Port- is that Portland Portland I haven't seen them on much T V that much at all but all I can do is hear about boy they have the seeing eye What do they have Walter Davis and Um Right Right Yeah Yeah I don't think there's any clear pick you know I guess the two teams that you can't count out are the Celtics because of Bird and the Lakers because of Magic Johnson They are two guys that seem to find a way when they When it's on the line they seem to find a way You know uh so those are what makes a champion I guess Yeah Nice talking to you Take care Bye
