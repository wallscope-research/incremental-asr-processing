Hi So do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have Do you watch a lot of T V to get the news then Um Well I read uh I get a bunch of different things I get a newspaper every day and I try to at at least have a few minutes to look through that and I look through uh I get a NEWSWEEK every week which I I pretty much read that cover to cover and I as far as you know that satisfies most of the short term news I get Uh don't watch much T V don't have enough time and uh don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that you know they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened and that's about all I ever hear of it Uh but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK and for the longer term I I read uh like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and and uh READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which they the news isn't like immediate what you'd generally think of as news but it's recent material Yeah it is it is more in depth less broad Well actually it's probably isn't less broad but it's just more in depth and uh it is it is more sig- it is more just significant information you know It is the big events not the little events Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main you know Yes or they're making making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news Uh I get kind of bored watching T V actually when I watch the news on T V because it goes so slow and then there's nothing that you know really is like oh so exciting Yeah that that's about what it ends up being Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something Yeah I think they're about the same I you know they they certainly have a very similar uh charter at least in my mind And uh uh what what kind of uh what kind of news normally interests you I mean what do you what what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring Uh-huh I think it will uh they they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence but we've yet to see it and th- it's real short term yet though I mean it's only been three months or something like that since that happened so But they like to tell us that it's going to be important I think it is too Yeah I I think that's a possibility uh it we might also be helped though because it it will be easier to do business over there too For the companies that already have a presence over there and uh I know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it came time Yep Because once you're in there then you can easily expand But getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult Yes And there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist even amongst themselves they're being somewhat protectionist you know Like England doesn't want to do one thing and and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing and they're they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet And some of it I mean is I'm sure within those people's minds it's quite justified Uh-huh Before they open up their borders to everyone Uh what is the uh do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that Against your will Yeah at least you guys have a remote control It's sometimes better to not have one of those Course you can always mislocate it Or misplace it I mean not mislocate it but misplace it and
