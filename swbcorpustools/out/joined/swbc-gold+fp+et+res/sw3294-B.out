Well let's see As far as I'm Well the thing I think that annoys me the most is I have I have young children a baby in the house and and inevitably as soon as they're asleep someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something And I think that that is probably the most aggravating Uh you know it invades my time I'm the one that pays for the phone Uh if I want to buy something I'll take the initiative and and go find it you know And that just really does aggravate me Uh what do you think Your time is is valuable and Oh I that's that's interesting I the the market seems to just be growing too I I guess enough people are not speaking out I'm not speaking out that's for sure I just get aggravated about it And I really don't know I'm I'm not into uh heavy government legislate- legislating of a lot of different areas but I I don't know I just I do particularly find it annoying Uh I'm really not sure I haven't given that a lot of thought if if it should should go you know slash error to be Well that yeah that might Identify themselves yeah Right Well that would be a good an interesting way yeah Right Right you're Oh is that right Oh that's interesting And they just get everybody Oh boy Well I I do wish that it would stop on my end because it it seems to happen at the worst possible moments And I I guess the next one is is door-to-door solicitors I don't mind the children when they're selling things for school I have kids and you know that's just kind of part of it but when it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning uh that really it makes you not feel particularly safe and it's annoying as well Right you just you really don't know so I I find myself being a l- a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than than I might normally be but I do feel like it's a an invasion of my space And uh I've never quite understood the purpose of that Yeah I uh Just be- Just a survey Yeah There have been a couple of times when the the uh whatever the subject was I guess caught my interest and I went along with it and then there have been several times when I just said well I just really don't have the time you know to deal with it at that moment But uh I don't get too many of those I've had just a few Uh generally someone's trying to sell me something or Right right Right Yeah That's right Oh Right Yeah Well we That's true Yeah you just never know I guess That yeah I I Asking for information is is I can't really see that I think they ought to if if nothing else they ought to spend money for a postage stamp and you know when it arrives at your house oh I
