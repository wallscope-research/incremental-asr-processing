I think it's uh a good idea Um I grew up uh my teenage years were spent during the sixties graduating uh high school in sixty-eight Um I remember when the Peace Corps movement first came about and I thought it was a very good idea at the time I was one of those uh Kennedy children if you know what I mean And uh right now I see a lot of kids who get out of school have no idea what they want to do And there's a lot of things out there that we could do uh for our own country let alone other countries and I think that we've got the the people power to do it it's just uh we need to channel it and focus it on some things that that need some fixing up Um some examples are this uh some of the things like Jimmy Carter's been involved in uh a little program to you know fix up housing for people And there's a lot of housing a- I know in the area that I live in that's run down and beat up but it could be fixed up and used and it's just you know sitting there wasting away Uh-huh Yeah I think a lot of people grow up with uh with uh preconceived notions li- what the world's about A lot of it has to do from too much T V and uh you know it's there's there's a heck of a lot of difference between you know the intake that you get from T V and and movies and what you hear in school and then what reality is Uh I remember uh I've I've worked since I was well I started delivering papers when I was ten and I had a real job when I was thirteen so I've you know worked most of my life But I remember when I got out of high school all through high school was boy I can't wait to get out of high school I can't wait to get out of high school And I wanted to go to college and I had the grades to go to college and I got accepted to college but when I got out of high school I kind of said you know what am I going to do now You know it's like you know when I actually started working full time and I I got married shortly after getting out of high school I uh thought I was smart ran away and got married and uh I remember there was a time and within the first year of marriage I said boy wouldn't I give to get be back in school and just have to do homework and and go work my part time job Because life and the reality of working for a living and trying to make ends meet is just so overwhelming to someone if they aren't prepared for it That's true Yeah Yeah a Um Yeah Yeah I think once once kids get out and see how other people really live and know how bad off some people really are and how good they've got it and what it takes to have that good life a- if you're willing to work for it then they're probably be more inclined to work for it Uh-huh exactly You know I've I've s- I my my parents are in their late sixties now and um so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore And it's it's really hard on them and the you know the thought that I I see the uh the mall rats you know walking around the mall nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long when they could be doing something to help someone And uh you know yo- there's a uh a nice warm feeling I remember getting out of doing things like that when I was younger I mean I was a Boy Scout and the whole bit and Yeah Yeah I think there'd there'd be a you know a uh economic benefit for you know everyone concerned those doing the work and those receiving the the uh the services Yeah Yeah I think uh President Bush covered that in his uh State of the Union Address this year when he said that you know it's time for you know the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything Yeah Exactly Uh-huh Yeah Yes Yes Yeah One of the things they tried to push through in Maryland and uh weren't very successful was that if you were an able-bodied person on welfare you had to do some work And Yeah That's exactly what they were trying to get them to do Um both Yeah they use both Uh they have a they have another program in Maryland that's called Adopt A Highway
