Good grief That's just almost unaffordable isn't it Well I wonder if they couldn't just provide uh interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that That might be a step in the right direction I don't know Uh-huh You mean the uh the employers Uh-huh Because everybody's competing for jobs Well I used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do I I have to think about it some more now because my doctor is uh actually he's Canadian and uh he told me that there're a lot of uh lot of counts against the Canadian system which is basically the one people are talking about for here I don't understand the arguments exactly He says it restricts your choice of doctors and and so forth I'm not quite sure I understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does I mean we're on a private insurance plan right now uh actually I have my own business and and we our health insurance is through my wife's employer and uh and every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to and where we can buy our medicine and uh it changes every year It's always so confusing So Uh-huh Well yeah Of course the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the uh the limits of uh compensation but of course that is restricted choice so I don't think that the restricted choice really uh has to do with the difference between uh public and private health insurance I think it has to do with the the the uh attempt to limit cost doesn't it and everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way so Well um I guess the most sensible thing I've heard about this is they say people are trying You you have to recognize that if you're going to have the very best health care possible and uh available on demand whenever and wherever you want it then it's going to be expensive And if you want to pay less then you're going to have to settle for a health system that is not quite that uh lavish And uh Yeah what happened to Reagan's safety net anyway Did he take that back to California with him Using it for a trampoline now Yeah they'll be needing you in a couple of years because they're running out of kids down that the other end And Well if they're smart Uh-huh Right
