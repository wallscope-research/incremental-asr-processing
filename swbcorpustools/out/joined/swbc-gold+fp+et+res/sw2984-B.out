Okay so Right What what Uh No I I'm in uh well I live in uh Richardson Texas and uh Yeah And uh but grew up in uh Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of lawn and garden work Uh and uh Yeah No So uh uh not not growing up familiar with here uh uh when I get a chance I listen to that Neil Sperry and do that And uh Yeah Uh Yeah Don't do any uh any gardening in the sense of uh vegetable gardening but uh Tr- tr- tried some tried some different flowers and and uh bushes and stuff and uh uh have a have a lawn service There was one when we when we bought the house and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one but in terms of the fertilizing and uh weed control mainly leave that up to them What about you Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Well <> Well good Yeah No Yeah Yeah What what what kind of a is this some sort of a disease or is it a pest What Well what kind what kind of trees are they Huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah Well that's that's one thing that we a- we've had very poor luck with with is in in our yard is is trees but the uh what what trees were were there when we moved in uh uh were had been put in by the developer when he built the house and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree I think And uh figured up last night at there were seven different trees of of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in and we got one left at this point but uh a couple of them we've lost to the w- weren't too good trees we've lost to wind uh uh Three we three we've lost to to uh freezes between uh eighty-three and uh and then uh a year ago we lost uh another one Well d- Yeah we- we didn't ha- we didn't have any that were that that big when they uh went two o- two of them uh the wind the wind blew over uh in in terms of getting them down Uh the Yeah Yeah Now th- the one that the one that we lost the last one that we lost a a year ago uh u- up until then they do- hadn't been big enough but what I just used a hand saw and sawed them off at at as close close to ground level as I could and then uh got s- got some chemical that drill holes and pour in that helps helps rot the stump ki- yeah stump killer and stump stump rotter But uh this last one had a fair sized root and some guy was doing a job in the neighborhood uh and and saw it and stopped in and asked if I didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty-five bucks and I said fine He had he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that and it yeah and it it just it just ripped it right out and uh I took the i- it left the it left he left the chips and I put them up mulch ar- around around the other shrubs and uh uh had had a pile of dirt from various things uh back by the garage that I filled in with and and it's filling in with with grass uh nicely this year so that that was that was worth it but uh Yeah Yeah but uh Yeah well y- do you do your own uh lawn in terms of uh mowing Yeah Oh yeah Yeah I uh yeah I I I we just got a a old push uh uh Sears mower I it's been fifteen years now since we first moved to Texas we've had it and I keep waiting for it to die but every year it just seems to hang on and uh and uh I do it my do it myself But uh yeah we- a year a year ago I took into took it into Sears to have it tuned up for the season and they said no it's it's too old we won't even work on it And I took it back home and it's can't kept plugs along But uh But my son's uh o- one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have <>
