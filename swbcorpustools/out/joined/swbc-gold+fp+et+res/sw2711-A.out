So the topic is vacations I think so I enjoy them Uh the last was back down to Lubbock to visit parents It was The last one was back down to Lubbock Texas to visit family But that's not the tradition for us Uh we enjoyed Yellow Stone real well last year Yeah Oh Rocky Mountain National Park It's it's just like any of the other national parks It you know there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching and Oh it's Yeah we usually try and drive up there oh once every year or two Sure To the top the of the peak sure Oh it's not bad at all It's it's a beautiful drive Now I admit up there the altitude is kind of <> interesting You know you get a little lightheaded and giddy but it's fun You know take along a picnic lunch and Oh we love it Uh no they're only to the east uh I mean to the west of us Here in the Springs you know it's right there at the very foot of the Rockies You know and once a week we drive up into the mountains usually you know usually once a week once every other week Yeah well I enjoy hills in Texas too I've been in Sherman No I haven't you Uh once to Mexico City but just a little day thing on business Uh that's nice Did you enjoy it Did you enjoy it Uh-huh Uh got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture and Oh Huh So the place that I went that we've gone on vacation that I think I enjoyed the most was Seattle Well we uh was two years ago we went during the drought I'm sorry three years ago It had been dry for a whole week It didn't rain for a whole week Yeah somehow we picked the right time and uh walked down on the wharf and I think we ate seafood every meal for well not quite every meal but most meals for a week Uh it was wonderful Uh the Pacific Science Museum the little girl really enjoyed It's <> very interesting Yeah Yes It was it was super and uh went to the Seattle Aquarium And it's right down there on the right there on the ocean and <> down there on the wharf by the piers and all and you walk down in a dome a glass dome and the bay is circulating over your head and you and you can watch the fish swim by and sharks and oh it's Yeah and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises and oh it's it's amazing Oh absolutely Without a doubt Seattle is beautiful and the mountains the mountains to the east of Seattle are just incredible I rode a ferry for the first time in my life You know up there <> you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry Instead of by bridge And you drive your car on You park your car you set your brake You walk upstairs and you have a beer or coffee or whatever depending on the time of day It's amazing Yes Yes Yeah yeah And there are people literally that everyday take the ferry you know and drive on to it yeah live on an island off off shore from Seattle And you uh everyday they drive on the ferry They go upstairs and have their morning coffee Take for the twenty to hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and you know depending on where it is Well in some places you know in some areas you know depends on how far they are commuting Oh it it's strict I'm I'm a West Texan Out there in the land of no water And to think that people live on the water daily is kind of odd to me You know it's it's a different life style than we are used to Oh Galveston Yes I liked Galveston real well uh <> there's uh one of the areas down there close to Galveston is I forget the name of the island but it's a bird sanctuary with all kinds of wild birds Whooping and sand hill cranes and ducks and pelicans and it's very pretty Uh I like the Rio Grande Valley Real well Of course you haven't lived until you have been to San Antone to the to the Alamo Yeah the river walk Oh it's And you need to go in the Spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there Oh it's just simply beautiful And of course always when I lived in West Texas had to annually go down to San Antone just Yeah and go to uh Lone Star and uh you know make my annual pilgrimage to the Lone Star Brewery and should be slash unit Uh El Paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way should be slash unit You know go across the border and all Uh the Davis Mountains are interesting out there in West Texas Yeah yeah Uh now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter because <> there's a beauty to the desert that it can most be it can best be appreciated when you are not burning up You know whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at It's most enjoyable to get you know to get warm That's nice uh down there in the lower Rio Grande Valley closer to where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf that's interesting I love the Texas Hill Country And uh Austin is neat for for an occasional visit Yeah yeah it's a fun few days Uh Oh U T is real pretty Uh there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area Marble Falls and all That's real pretty Uh I would say definitely go see that part and uh I'd say go to uh Midland once just for the heck of it I don't know why exactly But uh you know find out when they are holding <> the petroleum fair uh
