That's interesting I went to a smaller school of probably three thousand thirty-five hundred And I I thought that was the best experience in that we had more one-on-one since we seemed to know everyone on campus and we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and backgrounds and so forth so I thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number um one of fifty thousand I was one of three thousand and and you know different perspectives I uh but it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of sort of thing Yeah Uh-huh yeah That's one thing to definitely consider Uh-huh Yeah I think that's probably keyed to me is not so much the size the school but what what is the particular needs of the students and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this um larger university setting some of the students um when I was when I was teaching school would not have been comfortable with that They needed uh at least at first they needed a smaller setting that that was more like family where they could get one-on-one from from teachers professors and so forth and then after a year or two move on to a little bit bigger pond where where when they had a little more self-confidence built up oh yes I can do this oh I've done this before it's just in a bigger setting and so maybe to me the key would be wh- what is a   chi- + the the students needs and what what school or schools can best meet those those needs besides education yo- yo- you can expect all of them with uh a- a- accreditat- accreditation to give the education seems that this should be 2 slash units the second starting at "yo-" but it's these other things that you and I are are keying off on that that are really more of an education that but they're the things that don't show up in That's right that's right Right Huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I guess I guess now I've been out for I I'm older than you I've been out for twenty-one years And I was looking at an annual last night something had sp- it sparked a question and I went to a small private school um and it was church related And I got to looking at my class of sixty-nine and I realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from here and I've lived in other states and done other things for the past twenty years where I go to church now there are five other people that went to school at the same time in the same class as I and it's it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same memories if not the same education in you know we weren't all out to be teachers or or whatever so we didn't have the same classes but we had a common thread something that still ties us together twenty odd years later And it's it's + it's  kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things those are what I carry beyond that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at T I I have something more important to me than that Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I was going to ask who won In in that case uh regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed and finding a school that that met her specific requirements and and made the best fit for her Yeah I think it helps a now my grandfather was going to pay if I went to uh what's now U T Arlington because it was there in my hometown I could live at home But I chose to go to another school and even though he was pleased that it was a church related school he was not willing to pay any at all even the same amount of money and I think I value my my education more because I had to work for it And because I knew all along that's what I wanted eve- even though I had to buck the family in order to to do what I needed to do So Um I guess I guess it was it was my mother's support that got me through it that and ten years of of uh loans after I got out Sounds familiar huh Your it's very fresh in your memory I Yeah well sorry about that Tanya I'm sure it was worth it though If if nothing else because I work in training at T I now if nothing else just those experiences beyond and and including your educational classes that help give you the self-esteem to do and achieve whatever you set your mind on and the you you made the right choice in going to a school that met all of your needs to make to give you the the potential to do whatever you wanted Young lady you have gotten your education then that that's right <> Yeah
