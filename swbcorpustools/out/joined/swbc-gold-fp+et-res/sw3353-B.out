Well I have gone to girls camp a few times as you know a chaperon or a leader whatever and I enjoy camping I we have a tent and we've gone even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove I guess my biggest memory is when we froze to death We just didn't take enough blankets and whatever we went camping at Lake Bonham which is pretty close here we went fairly early in the season for this area which is probably April is when we went and it got really cold at night and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning but we take little nature hikes and we take along games that we can play with the kids and just that kind of stuff Usually try to have occasionally a camp fire at night you know and roast the marshmallows and what all Oh  Uh-huh  We used to live in Utah and of course there's lots of mountains around there to camp in and streams and stuff that's a great place to go camping and the hiking is just really great You know hike up those mountains is just really fantastic I'm not acquainted with any you know I there's woods and things out in East Texas Tyler area you know there's a Tyler State Park that's really a nice camping area but it's just a lot of trees it's not I don't know of any place in Texas that has really big you know what I call mountains The Rocky Mountains are so much bigger than anything that they've got down here that No well it's not too bad They have screened in areas you know they're not really cabins I wouldn't say I guess they could call them that but they're more just a screened in camping area whatever they're not bad Yeah yeah Yeah that's right I take it you haven't done a whole lot of camping in this area I see Well you're just trying to get over the culture shock still Yeah Yeah well really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring and in the fall It just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly I mean there's a lot
