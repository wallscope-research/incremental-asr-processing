Well what do you is think is the main change in What generation are you I'm thirty years old You're twenty-nine okay so we're both children of the very early sixties  Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah the family structure in general is being really restructured from one income to two incomes which means from one parent to two part-time parents if you're lucky I it's funny it's both of us then were really just adolescents when I think most of the major changes for adult women were going on in America I don't think changes are still progressing but it seems to me that  really the seventies + the early seventies was a period of the most change and if I had to somewhat abstract about it it seems to be the major change has been that woman have acquired more choice I mean that's sort of the meta change as it were where that woman really have more of a choice now about what they do course they find that the choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if it is for your you know you can share something you really want which is a wonderful thing but it does seem like an awful lot of my adult women friends are anguishing over some of these choices  Uh-huh Yes Yes yes Right She just settled for that Yeah Well I only know I have of my friends who have children I only know of one woman who's decided to go that quote unquote traditional route And I have a lot of respect for her because she made it as a real choice She really knew that she didn't have to do that but she decided that was what she wanted to do in her life and she wanted that role She's a marvelous parent and you know I say all power to her because she's an example to me of someone who really does have the choice I feel that a lot of women don't all right I said they have the choice but they don't necessarily feel that they do because they no longer feel like if they were just to be a parent rather than you know a sort of super woman success in the business world as well they would somehow be perceived as a failure in their own eyes or in others and then it's not a choice anymore and frankly it's the way that men are men don't have this choice they don't feel this choice in most subcultures in America that I've been exposed to if the man were to say no I've decided not to work I want to stay home and do the child rearing my wife has a good job and I want her to keep that too long an utterance needs to be broken up and I'm going to be the primary caretaker you know and then take care of the children because we don't want to put them in day care and this and that I think most Americans would feel funny about that Maybe sort of feel like he isn't that success that he could have been So it's Uh-huh I didn't happen to see that yeah I knew people who did that years ago but they were very apologetic about it because you could tell they were used to people saying What are you doing that for you know Yeah Yeah I've seen more and more companies that have parental leave not just maternity leave They can have paternity leave as well as maternity leave Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh Yeah the other big change I see in woman's lives is to remain biological because they are having children much later in life I mean my friends who are having children are having them at age thirty And if I'd been a couple of generations ago they would have had kids running around by then Yeah Yeah Yeah I actually think that I'm somewhat encouraged by that trend because after all people live longer lives now so like you know it's not like you're going to you know pass away before your child is an adult I mean barring you know unforeseen circumstances And I think most people make better parents when they are a little bit more mature I really do Uh-huh Yeah Yeah yeah That's true So I guess I'm pretty encouraged I really am But then I'm a product of my generation I don't know if I had been born a hundred years ago and were looking at this time I might not like it but it sure seems nice to me I mean I have other things to complain about but in terms of woman's roles things really seem a lot more flexible Yeah I mean it's still a small minority but it's an improvement It really is really Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Oh what's her name No it we don't get much Texas politics out in California to be honest Uh-huh That's right although during the Presidential debates there was some really nasty patronizing stuff toward I don't know if you saw those but I thought she was treated badly for being a woman frankly I really did by then vice-presidential candidates who really I thought had a demeaning attitude towards her And it was acceptable to say certain types of things to her that she couldn't say back that kind of thing which I found myself getting quite enraged about But really that's a previous generation I don't it's harder to imagine people of our age doing that and not feeling really stupid Well they've gotten their five minutes worth of us I've enjoyed talking with you Okay take care Bye bye
