Okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Damn it I agree pretty much with everything you've said the one thing that you know I'd advise any parent you know or any person looking for a college is that I think you know it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from you know the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the you know actual students there because you know they're just in my experience I've talked to people at other colleges that you know the lifestyle pictured in the catalogs isn't always the whole story Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I go to Georgia Tech which is you know primarily an engineering school and you know I think I really do miss the fact you know that it's not a university that there's not the you know it tends to be a very conservative school and there doesn't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of you know universities will have Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I don't really know of anyone that's looking for colleges now you know with the exception of people's younger brothers and sisters Then the only advise passed down is don't go to Georgia Tech but no actually I'm more interested in choosing the right job when you graduate type information Uh-huh Uh-huh Program Uh-huh Uh-uh Uh-huh like a fine arts education I Uh-huh
