my first comments on the budget I would say there has Surprisingly no I would cut the prison systems and let them self-support  You mean the prisons I hadn't heard that Right But to me it Well see the other way I'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting like the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons Anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves In other words they're in there for a purpose put them to work rather than sitting there It's the same thing like the whole I shouldn't say criminal but the whole police department of the United States I feel the same way someone gets picked up for drunk driving he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there So it's you know self-defense on that point as far as my defense budget they're cutting it back now what twenty-five percent I wouldn't want to see it cut any more than that But again I'd like to see something on the other end back into education But not in the education we have today So I'm lost on that one I would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems And to come up with something a little better than what we've got Well not so much pay I'm not trying to see the government put out any more Yeah But see we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college <> To go either as an apprentice which they do in other countries Just doing it which I think would bring the education back up You know why not an apprentice out to a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or you know just a technician You can learn on the job of course again which would mean again our education budget will go down if this is in a few years I mean it's not going to be overnight But that would come down Excuse me I see it being done I know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever and she's training her Yes Wow Yeah It sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere Well Uh-huh Well that's something about what Germany's supposed to be doing Something similar to that right now And they have jobs out on you know bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields But see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at high school level which I would like to see Rather than so many kids getting out of school they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around Because they don't have any education I don't mean college And I'm for college But there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote college is concerned They've had it Uh-huh yeah But there's a lot of them out there that haven't That's Well it seems to me that kids that get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it usually are your drop outs Where if they're said hey it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like Seems that new slash unit should begin with "Where " even though what follows is a subordinate clause  Because you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that Make as much money and if they enjoy it more they'll make a lo- happier life for themselves Question You threw that question on me about the deficit put it on your shoe now What would you do Were you watching I think one of the news stations I couldn't even tell you which one I watched But they had on there where the output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting
