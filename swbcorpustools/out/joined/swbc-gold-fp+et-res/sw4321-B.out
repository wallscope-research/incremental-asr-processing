No I've not I've been called but I had to beg off from the duty And you  Well I was originally chosen primarily I think because I was a young fellow and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict I don't know why Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago Yeah it's that the younger they are they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason and they kind of liked me I looked conser- and all that stuff and they I don't know what they saw in me but they saw it But back to the issue I don't know at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun But there too there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable particularly I think in civil cases In criminal cases I'd like to see the unanimity remain but in civil cases I think a majority rule by jury would be sufficient Well in a criminal case say one in which you know there is like say assault or some such I think there ought to be a unanimous vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this And in civil law there you know is such a thing as like let's say misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that A majority rule I think would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases I don't know if I'm making any sense or not Yeah often there's more incriminating evidence Like for instance say and also too I think I'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more serious in a criminal case well I really can't say for certain truth be known as it stands there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up both in a civil and criminal case I mean the documentary the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that You know I don't know if you're familiar with that or not A fellow when he was much younger was tried and convicted and sentenced to death Fortunately in his case the death penalty was revoked so he served out his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system The case was reopened and he was exonerated Yeah many laws but little justice certainly not certainly not And you know they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires You know the because you get up and they ask you a few questions both sides do and then you're either challenged which is you know each attorney can use that as much as they like or I think it's a limit now they probably have a limit now but they pretty much go through that and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve For me it was financial hardship But onto the thing I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing It was always my impression that the Justice himself or herself had the final say
