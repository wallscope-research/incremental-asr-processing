Well what do you think about the everyday occurrences that are an invasion of your privacy Oh Right Yeah I think that's the only thing I wrote down also because it's terrible today I mean my wife and I seems like we get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and rings up until ten eleven o'clock sometimes Yes I know that's true Yeah that's true But you know people it's like your name must be on a list or something because I know at my office I probably average at least a call a day and a lot of days I'll get two and three calls from people selling insurance you know to the small business man and you know according to what I understand Dunn and Bradstreet puts your name out to people also as far as brokers all I get calls from brokers in New York and California always trying to sell something oil investments or stock investments or whatever And now I'm getting the same calls at the house and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet and credit card companies they sell your name I know Yes American Express does that by the way Yeah I understand they you know they sell names because it's quite profitable to them And that is an invasion of privacy you're right I know that's true Exactly magazine companies from subscriptions do the same thing it's the way they make additional money But you know I guess it you have to be a certain income holder to have an American Express card so your name is valuable to I guess X amount of solicitors calling So I don't know where are you from okay well so yeah we live in the Dallas area Richardson Okay Did you Yeah I've talked to people in Utah people in New York and a lot of times I'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning and I'll get people you know from out of the state I'll be darned Where you from Not from Texas New Jersey right Yeah My wife's from New Jersey Yeah from Saddle River She Okay Well that's nice too Really yes my wife's been away for twenty-five years so she's been away for quite a while Her dad was from Little Rock Arkansas and her mother was from New York so they over there in New Jersey and anyway this topic is a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy but that's the biggest one I can think of is just all the solicitors calling I know that's a good suggestion I might start using the answering machine more because it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings Right Sure Yeah you're probably right I understand I mean I it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriffs associations and I know they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival or circus and Right There's always a dif- and my pat answer now is well you just called me the other night
