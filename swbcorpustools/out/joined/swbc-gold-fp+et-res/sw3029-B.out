That doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial/ Well I think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence need to be reevaluated I think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all Crimes against children is one of them Yeah Uh-huh Actually I would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in Middle Eastern countries If you steal you lose a hand You know if you kill you lose your life What's wrong with that Yeah  Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Deciding what that proper punishment is is one thing I think that there should be no way I realize that innocent people could go to what is it lethal injection now Innocent people could do that but for every innocent person who would be executed hopefully there would be ten guilty Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh To maintain a prison inma- that's right That's stupid Uh-huh Sure <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Sure Well I don't have solutions to the problems but you know you have these this would be nice and there's probably thousands of holes in that theory but I think that if you did something for example to an individual and caused them to lose the ability to earn a living I remember a man drove by randomly shot a woman in the head while she was driving  Seems that "I remember' starts a new thought  blinded her I think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate I think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual or the family of an individual who has been harmed you you know People who kill policemen Policemen who are killed in the line of duty  Between this utterance and B70 there seem to be 3 slash units  They may or may not have been willfully intending to kill that policeman but that family still has no provider  See note above Also this should probably end in a slash because B72 starts with a coord conjunct and a subject  And I s- Uh-huh That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh I don't agree with the length of the sentence though I think expediency is the answer Uh-huh Uh-huh That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh That's right technical I think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals Yo- you can appeal it once I think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is contradictory Yeah That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh That's right Well one of the sad things is that so many of these never actually come to trial because of the process in which the criminals were apprehended I mean you know the guy is guilty You know he's done what he's done you may have stood there and seen it But because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested you know he goes free Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Right and I realize that that is designed to protect the innocent It's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers And I just don't think that I think we could get along a lot better in our criminal justice system if we had some statute of limitations on lawyers I hope you're not a lawyer Yeah Absolutely That's why you check books out from the library But I really believe that our justice system is the best around but it's not perfect and that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact in tact> intact That's right That's right Uh-huh That's right That's right and it I don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter And that just that really does ruffle my feathers at times I mean I can just get so aggravated about it But you know it's going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem And I hope not lawyers
