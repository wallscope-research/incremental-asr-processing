I don't subscribe to any magazines at home because we get so many at work that I need to read that I just don't take any at home Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right I used to take MCCALL'S and GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and several magazines like that a few years ago at home But yeah the subscriptions ran out and I never renewed them And I found that I really didn't have time at home since I work to read them Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh when I had my magazines at home I would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures you know and if something caught my eye then I might read something but otherwise than that you know they were you know not too useful to me You know I got some good recipes from them sometimes but Uh-huh That's right that's right Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Well since I work with computers during my work I have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything And I have to read the magazines you know such as BYTE and COMPUTER WORLD and MAC WORLD and all of these magazines such as that so I really you know just <> I can see that it will be a very long time probably before I subscribe to any magazines at home Uh-huh Right That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right if I go on an airplane ride or something I'll stop in and pick up you know a COSMOPOLITAN or something to read on the airplane But you know that's basically just about I'll buy a crossword puzzle magazine every now and then Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Okay It was nice to talk with you too Thank you Bye-bye
