are you from this area Okay I'm in Garland so Well I'm in Dallas right now but I live in Garland well I don't know if you know but Garland has got a real big recycling center that in fact we went to it yesterday You drive up and you take the stuff out of your trunk and they have different bins for the different materials like clear glass and colored glass and plastics and they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom That's pretty neat my daughter is four and she's real interested in recycling So we're trying to promote that because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away but we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them does Dallas have a curbside recycling program yet okay Yeah Yeah like soda bottles are one type of plastic and milk jugs are one type of plastic You can te- it's got little most of the recyclable containers have the little symbol on the bottom with the arrows around it that tells whether it's a one or a two or a three it's just different kinds of plastics like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic And that's what the different types are Yeah Yeah yes I know there's a long scientific name but it's like polytechnochloride and all that fun stuff I don't know if they do it all over but our Kroger does a newspaper recycling every Saturday You can drive up and they have one of no the bag boys out there that will take the newspaper out of your car and they'll put it in their little bin and they do the recycling I mean they collect the newspapers and their plastic grocery bags which I think is pretty neat That's something since we all seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags I know we use them for trash can liners and a lot of other things Yeah in fact I have one today The only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom It's like whoops there goes my chips okay fine Now I in fact did you happen to see TWENTY TWENTY the other night They did a program or one of their articles was on recycling and it was actually on a town that has a dump that they charge other cities or towns to come in and dump their trash there They have made so much money from that that they bought a brand new fire engine and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough so or built a new one and paid for it in cash with the money that they've earned from this landfill They have built up one mountain They call it Mount Trashmore They built up one mountain covered it with grass and put ski lifts on it and in the winter they put snow on it and they charge to ski on it So the city gets the money from that they built a golf course at the bottom and they get the money from that I's like that's it's Riverview Ohio or some place up there But I thought it was a pretty neat idea I mean their city hall looked better it was nicer than Dallas' and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city And they like the trash So Well okay But I thought it was pretty neat it would be nice if more communities could do that but you have to know from beginning and you have to have the space to do it and Yeah see that's well they're already planning a second mountain So they're going to be called the Twin Peaks I was like uh-huh Go back two T V shows it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling It I know I've got a two year old and a four year old and that's my daughter thinks that any time she sees newspapers bundled up they're being recycled So it's like well no Honey So that like so that was one reason we went to show her what people did with their stuff when they recycled it and try to explain well yeah you melt down the cans and you make them into new things and you get the paper all wet and you make it into new paper and that's fun trying to explain that to a four year old so do you all go ahead Well yeah she that was her next question was how do you grow paper Was like well from trees That's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees Yeah exactly Well let's see we really don't but And then she was like well what do you do with the glass Well you crunch it up real small and then you melt it down Well what if it breaks Well okay it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her But at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing and she got our baby-sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans because that's all she talked about So I guess what
