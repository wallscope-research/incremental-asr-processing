We're supposed to talk about crime in the city And seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays doesn't it Well it is but our crimes up here as I think it must be in most cities now but I was listening to the news the other day and they said they thought the reason it was up so was because so many people are without work nowadays economy's so bad That's a good point That's just what they quoted over the news I don't know if I believe that or not but it does seem up and What kind Well I think we got a pretty good newspaper we have two the MORNING NEWS and the TIMES HERALD MORNING NEWS seems to have the largest circulation I think it's a pretty good it's a locally owned paper The HERALD is owned I think by the TIMES out of L A or somewhere But Well they don't no not really they don't play it up I don't think but there is too much of it you know too many homes broken into We had our fact about last year sometime our home was broken into We Yeah we I didn't think ours ever would be burgled but so many in our neighborhood had been and because we live on a corner and back up to a real highly traveled main street But we were so Sort of yeah And I never did get a security system but since that happened I certainly have It's I guess excuse me just a standard with all the doors and the infrared you know motion detector Pretty standard Yes yes It's monitored and all that And I think the thing that makes a lot of noise would suffice I really do But this deal that was part of it for you know three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever but it the monitoring is not that bad though because we've goofed it up you know several times you'll hit the wrong key not intentionally or something and they call back pretty quickly so you know I think it's all right But I to answer your question I think that is a pretty good deterrent in itself whether it Uh-huh Well it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly that if it's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway Supposedly Who knows you know But that's a selling point And I think it probably does these things supposedly pretty good Boy they sure advertise so many of them nowadays But well don't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there I'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's Down here we seem to or not here but the statistics seem to say that I don't know Is that right I would gather probably from drugs And I think that's the reason it's so high everywhere But I don't think there's anyplace used to years ago you thought well these little small cities and all wouldn't have that problem but they do We've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it as anyone you know That's a good question I don't know I don't know what the solution is I really don't Yeah Yep Th- and nothing seems to change And I'm not sure that anything will because if something could happen to make these people not want to buy it but they want to buy it so Supply and demand Long as somebody wants to buy it somebody going to provide it for them So you know I don't know what the solution is I really don't I don't think anyone does in fact
