Okay Yes Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right mercy Yeah that's too bad that's sad It really is Uh-huh Uh-huh that's wonderful Uh-huh Well that's wonderful That speaks well of your mother She had high standards Yeah bless her heart Challenges Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh- uh-huh Surely Well I think that you carried forth your subject matter very well Nickie And I can relate to that I think it's the image that the woman has and in the world as the lesser of the two And I think things are changing but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to take And I think we are progressing at a snail's pace but we are progressing So that's the main point is that we are going ahead And I think that in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve And men a lot of them have come around and have seen the error of their ways But there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change So we have to face that reality also It could be if they are not sure of themselves The one's that go along with that they are sure of themselves And they know that they can you know be on the same level And they do not have any ego problems that they are fighting And I think that we are going to be on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term and what I would like to see happen futuristically is what we are discussing is that yes we each have our jobs in life and that we should recognize that And that we should support each other And I think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other And just looked at each other as equals and none lesser because we are equal Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Well I guess we would have to go back to the way that the Lord made us And the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands And I believe that strongly but I think that they should be in harmony with what they are with what the subject matter is And I think the issue should be settled before there's a conflict and I think that can happen in a very wonderful way And if we men and women would do as the Bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves Can you picture that I mean if your husband did that to you and you did that to your husband you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself And that's really the divine answer and the right answer So that would be a beautiful relationship And I think there are some people that have done that and I have seen it And it's just marvelous and I am just in awe to see this
