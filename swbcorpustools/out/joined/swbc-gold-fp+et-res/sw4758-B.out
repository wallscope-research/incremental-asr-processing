Yes yes Different set Uh-huh Oh Well I have a bunch of computer journals because I'm in computer science but beyond that lately I've been reading I've always liked the NEW YORKER And lately I've been picking up some of the travel both trade magazines and just the general travel magazines trying to keep up on what's going on my wife also gets a lot of the food magazines BON APPETITE and FOOD AND WINE and GOURMET Yeah And she still likes to get TIME which I've never liked very much but she seems to Do you read a newspaper Yeah Some of them I used to get for the advertising Like BYTE magazine which is one of the larger computer ones I haven't bought it now for about eight years But when I used to get it it was about five hundred pages about three hundred of them advertising Because that was interesting I think a lot of the trade magazines are like that that half the fun is finding out what all the products are But you know some of the get ridiculous TRAVEL AND LEISURE all of the AMERICAN EXPRESS magazines so TRAVEL AND LEISURE FOOD AND WINE and I think they have some others certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for and it's clear that I've bought some of these through wholesalers and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription they're making everything on ads Uh-huh Have you ever read or subscribe to CONSUMER REPORTS for any length of time But not worth it I've always had this one of the reasons I like just to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective So I've always had this problem with CONSUMER REPORTS that in the areas that I know a lot about I disagree with them And I always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything or what's going on So like I've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent organization magazines and it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective you know their major interest is in commissions and you know there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines Their major talk is about you know commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not the full ten percent or whatever it is and it gives you a different perspective on what people do some of them the general travel magazines do I don't tend to read it for that Because I don't expect to be traveling overseas in the future for quite awhile But I usually just read through the sections on domestic stuff No Yeah I don't take much more in myself Okay Okay nice talking to you
