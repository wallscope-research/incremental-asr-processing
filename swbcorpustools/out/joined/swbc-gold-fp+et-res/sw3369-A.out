Well have you seen a new movie lately Uh-huh Okay I haven't seen either one of those what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though Well maybe you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES Okay What did you think of that one Uh-huh Yeah I just moved down in fact from South Dakota in June and that's when the movie was filmed and when the movie came out we went my dad lives in the state capital which is Pierre and it was filmed right outside of Pierre In fact the big buffalo herd scene that was a live scene there's a guy that has got a buffalo farm and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and my dad has got a little plane we flew over it all a- looked at the buffalo it was really neat so we are watching the movie in the movie theater in Pierre and just every time I would start to get into the movie and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell hey there's John Red Eagle you know or you know they'd start recognizing people Yeah So I think I enjoyed it more when I watched it on video cassette than I did in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that I'd go now which one could that be you know and I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of picking up the overall Right Exactly but I thought it was a good film But you are right I think it was very one sided Sure Right In fact I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night and it was a similar situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking an army fort but it was an interesting movie have you seen PRETTY WOMAN Now I thought that was a good show Yeah it didn't have any real social bearing and it wasn't really a comedy but it was an enjoyable movie it was kind of like the STAR WARS series you know just something a little different yet believable now or are you much of a STAR TREK fan are you going to see this next one that's coming out Have you seen the rest I think I've missed one I'm not sure but I think I've missed one Was that here in Dallas Okay Because we had one here in Dallas Uh-huh
