Well I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool and it's just really pretty easy It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring And I like that the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in it and then you're supposed to do chicken but I just use those little cans of chicken And it makes it so much easier and so you dump the rice you dump the chicken and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off but I get my kids to do that so I don't have to do that and it really and you mix it all up with ye- there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up but it's so simple and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime Uh-huh Yeah it has to sit in the fridge over night but it's really good And I like that one Yeah Exactly Uh-huh that sounds good Yeah yeah And these days that helps doesn't it Yeah I know what you mean Now spaghetti's such an easy one I do that a lot I do spaghetti a lot Yeah I don't like to do that if it's real hot though Because I don't know I have a real thing about being hot in the summertime I guess Yeah Yeah I think that's right And we don't entertain that often but when we do I'm like you I like it to be fast and easy And something so that we can talk and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time Yeah Yeah That's exactly like us from our church we just do it yeah  Well you see all that on T V and I could never be that person I'm just not well I'm pretty laid back And you know so I know a lady in my church and she like does her own bread and does her own stuff and so when she does food she really goes all out and I don't know how she can do it and be calm I guess No I don't Uh-huh yeah how exciting Yeah Well I usually start about six and cook and then eat at seven I mean cook at five and eat at six rather Yeah and my family and I we're a sit down together family yeah I don't like the run in and out part And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me and my husband about what's happened and I think that was ingrained in me during my family time at home And you know we could learn to talk about things and I think that's good Yeah I think Yeah yeah  Well that happens to us sometimes too But sometimes if something is on that they want to watch I leave it on but we eat in the kitchen and their heads are always poking past the door Yeah Anyway food is a real life-style kind of thing and some people don't like to do this but I like to cook with my kids And if they're going to have other kids over then then they help And we make real simple things you know those I don't know if you've ever made them maybe not since you don't have kids yet but those Jell-O gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers I can't think of what they call it Yeah they're so simple And the kids love to do that finger food is a biggie with them and like now one thing I wish I could find a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that and it's just really hard and if you have to work with a knife I don't like that So that's they like to eat it but it's a hard one to have to prepare But they like that with the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that Yeah Yeah My son's getting to be a real good cook so sometimes he fixes me breakfast Yeah I like it I like it a lot He's eleven Uh-huh Yeah so hi- not every morning mostly during the summer it's hit and miss and we usually have like cold cereal or something like that during wintertime when they're in school then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like twice a week or something and then have like when it's really cold I even cook oatmeal Because I like oatmeal and they like it all right And then sometimes we do something it has to be fast because they're on their way to school we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that but Yeah so I try to and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that I used to do them in the microwave but they don't like that  it depends If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray and they will be a little harder and I don't like that So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in if you have a microwave book but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with like a plate over the top And let it steam and then stir it up Yeah and that turns out okay And it's funny 'cause if I turn them out on to like a plate for them to take what they want they don't know I've ever done it in a microwave It's really funny it's very deceiving you know 'cause if they see it with their eyes they go I don't like want that you know and yet if they don't ever see it then it's like this tastes okay you know so Anyway Yeah
