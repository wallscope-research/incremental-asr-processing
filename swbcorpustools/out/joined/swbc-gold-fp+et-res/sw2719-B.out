it's scaled back considerably right now my exercise is pretty much limited to softball league and occasional ride on the bike but I just nine months ago got married and bought a house so my outside activities have been curtailed a lot Yeah lawn it's a forty year old house so we are doing a lot of refurbish work and yeah painting lawn gutters You name it all kinds of stuff flower beds Yeah that's true that's true there's always something to do and it keeps me going But Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Right Uh-huh gosh Wow Uh-huh No that's a tough situation Uh-huh Yeah that it's so aggravating to have an injury like that My wife or likes to run but she's well we moved down to the north end of Oak Cliff in the Castle Park area Yeah and she started running down there and all the hills And she lasted about two weeks and her ankles couldn't take it anymore She was used to running you know flat tracks and whatnot and ever since that it's just been real difficult It's real aggravating because she starts in and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff Even if she does get on flat ground so she's kind of in the same mode She was all ready to get back into it and start running five K's and ten K's and stuff this spring and she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape And when you want to do it it's really really aggravating You know it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise and it's another thing to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health Yeah Well it's Sure Yeah yeah Uh-huh it is and you know you don't spi- well Speaking for myself I don't sleep as well when I am not exercising and it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff your body just gets used to it Yeah I don't particularly enjoy it Well I used to lift weights an awful lot and stuff like that I do enjoy riding bike but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that I can't say I really enjoyed it all that much but once I got used to it it was habit forming It was I felt so bad if I didn't physically I mean I just my body was tuned into that mode and if I skipped it then it kind of threw the whole system out of whack Yeah Yeah That's for sure Okay That's right Did you really Okay yeah Right Okay okay Yeah it is we're on a little street called Bison Trail It's only about a block and a half long but it's over on the other end it's over by the far edge of Stephen's Park Golf Course Yeah it's you know where the little bridge is on North Oak Cliff Boulevard Yeah we are just south of that little bridge back-up on the hill in the trees there and yeah our street is an awful lot of retired people but the other half in fact our one little block and a half there four houses sold last summer and three sold the summer before and everybody in their late twenties to mid-thirties are buying and starting to rebuild and fix things up again and everybody is real excited Yeah it's a lot of fun the people are great There too we've got a real active neighborhood association And well we've got four regular parties every year and we do a neighborhood recycling program and all that kind of stuff So it's a lot of fun and it's a really beautiful area And some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too are picking up some of those great big houses and they're getting them at a real bargain You know they're getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars and they're just going to town with them people are putting in pools and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original you know nineteen thirty nineteen forties look And it's really coming around I guess it's worth the trip Uh-huh Okay Yeah Okay wow Yeah Uh-huh that's right Yeah ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big I guess it's twenty-eight by fifteen front porch Next door we've got an Austin stone Across the street the guy it was burnt out about two years ago and the guy moved in and completely redid it's got a rounded front on it It's all brick and he's landscaped his yard and he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that So yeah there's a variety you just don't see it anywhere else as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot she could a little bit We I tell you what we got into the fitness center at Methodist and they have a quarter mile track there So she has started doing that rather than take off The problem is she's a school teacher and for her she can't run in the morning For her to get home and try to run at six o'clock in the night in the winter time it's starting to get dark and you know you don't want to she doesn't want to be out by herself anywhere in Dallas Regardless whether it's north Dallas or whatnot when she goes over to this fitness center it's fenced in and there's somebody in the building watching her and all that so there's a lot of consideration Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right That's right That's right Uh-huh Yeah Right Yeah Yeah That's true It only takes one time It's a hard lesson to learn Yeah yeah you know it goes all over well you got the
