I think that one advantage of having the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't convict someone who really shouldn't be convicted and I think that you know a unanimous verdict helps to ensure that I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that you would have a problem you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted Have you ever served on a jury before okay what sorts of cases were they So were they criminal or civil okay what was the verdict did the jury have trouble reaching a decision Yeah So did it become Yeah  But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right You just needed a majority what was the other case That was also civil Yeah didn't really even count Yeah I'm a college student so I haven't been you know a jury eligible age for very long and I did get one summons actually at one point but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student because it was a very bad time Yeah I mean I would like to do at some point but I haven't one thing that I think you know maybe is a problem is I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well Especially sort of wha- you thought it turned out pretty well Yeah so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of someone had to figure out what was going on That's interesting did it work out pretty well in the end I mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume sort of a moderator role in the trial or So it did end up working out pretty well The one thing I sometimes wonder about in civil cases is whether especially sort of in maybe like product liability or medical malpractice where there's sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes you know it's not just a matter of you know did this guy rip off this guy and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract it's sort of a matter of you know sometimes getting into very technical issues and I wonder if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about whatever you know issue is under discussion in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind So Yeah  so the deal was that he had borrowed money from the bank to buy it and he hadn't made the payments Yeah so they were suing to get it back  Yeah
