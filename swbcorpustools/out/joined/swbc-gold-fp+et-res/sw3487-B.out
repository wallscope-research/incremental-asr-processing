Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right let's see when I went away to school I'm trying to think my criteria I guess when you're eighteen or so it would be important to know if it was a coed college That was a strict requirement for me again how serious a person is according to you know what they want to get out of school I guess they'd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home let's see now what was the question what's the criteria for picking a college What advice okay Yes Yes and also depending on how adjustable your child would be or flexible I guess it would be if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe they were unused to the way they run things I mean the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges I think The people are different and you have to be more flexible and more willing to adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things You know you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you're used to You think so let's see what else well climate would be you know you'd have to you know is somewhat if it's something different than the one they're used to I guess if they're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need to go out and play all the time not be in studying If you're in Florida or California I'd also advise them that if mom and dad paid for their college that if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year then they'd have to get a loan to continue That's right There's the responsibility of that And they could work and earn money towards college Also if they stay within their state you get a lot more financial aid or it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school and like I said if they was willing to work in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is By the time I have an eleven year old is my oldest so it's not too far away but it's okay But it's getting there I mean we still definitely can put away the money for college now I would advise that they did not have a car at college They would Yes I'm here No I think so too I think because most kids don't have a car at college the ones that do get taken advantage of and you know I think it's just trouble waiting to happen So I would advise they didn't take a car and they didn't take a television and they didn't take a refrigerator Maybe that No I Yeah we didn't have
