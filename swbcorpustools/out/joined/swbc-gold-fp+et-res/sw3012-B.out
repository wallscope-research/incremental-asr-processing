Hello I'm Nola and I'm in Plano Yeah now did you push one okay Okay but I think it's I just started doing this so I don't know too much about it okay Uh-huh That will be fine Hi Yeah Yeah Yeah Well I think overall that's right I think it's kind of sad though that for generations they've been taught to hate each other And i- you know if somewhere in there someone's going to have to learn a different way You know an I think that <> true we do have completely different ways of looking at a lot of things but at the same time I think there is a lot of good that the United States and other countries can do as far as example and <> I think some different things could come from what's happened than what we expect Yeah Yeah Yeah But that's the type of thing they understand They don't understand any other way And so at that you have to work at their level to an extent too They wouldn't have understood anything than what we did in the war There was nothing else Yeah Yeah I can't figure out why they adored him Yes yeah Yeah  Yeah Uh-huh What's sad is that the leaders that have control are power yes and they abuse that Which I think that that's not the way the majority of the people over there really are But I think in a way all the involvement over there too though has shown that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing And there are a lot of people who are good people You know there's and I think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the soldiers leaving you know surrendering and trying to get out of that situation and the you know That's right and I think so much of it is what you're taught You know they teach their children in such a way that
