Okay well I don- I mean what thoughts do you have on the subject you did Uh-huh Uh-huh That's wonderful Well you probably have a different sense than I have I went to an inner city high school in Chicago and that's not where I am originally from It was a divorce situation of my parents And it was a cultural shock to me in terms of what I went through The high school in fact it was called Tulley High School and now it's called Roberto Clemente yeah that's exactly about twenty years now what was it like living there I mean did you find that people appreciated having the privilege of being Right I agree with that yeah I didn't mean that in a totally negative sense Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right that you had ever been Right I mean I'll give you and idea that I had and I would say the majority appreciated what they were having in this country but a lot of the ones that didn't even in the minority not in the sense of the cultural word they made it worse for the other kids in school And you know Chicago back then even had bilingual classes Yeah and I mean I had geometry the teacher was from Cypress Greece and it was Spanish and English so if you can imagine how I even go- I mean and I guess I look at is as an enlightening sense but basically I think they should leave things the way they are right now I mean I don't really have enough in terms of an argument pro or con in terms of making any type of change Uh-huh Uh-huh Right that's exactly And that's exactly I mean I can remember instances that wasn't as you know bad Lord I don't know how it would be today Well I know what it looks like I've been back up for a reunion It does yeah but it's an experience I wouldn't change I mean my husband grew up in a majority WASP southern Ohio you know So that when he saw where I you know saw my later teenage years he was just I hate to say aghast because that sounds so trite but he was And yet how did I turn out the way I did turn out And I said that's really irrelevant What you find is that if you can talk to like I mean I learned a lot about the Island of Puerto Rico from talking to these kids You know and you lived there so you know that parts of it are beautiful and parts of it are squalor Like here yeah it's the same Uh-huh Uh-huh This is true Uh-huh I know what you're saying yeah th- Uh-huh Right right I probably would say the something if I knew intellectually that it was good and emotionally that the people there wanted it You know it's just I mean right now they have the privilege of voting with the United States don't they They count yeah as a principle that's what I thought but I've also been down there We traveled a lot to the B V I the British Virgin Islands So you always pass through San Juan in going to places like or I and it's I think what they do need is an infusion of some of the United States privileges some of our resources The educational the teachers the academic opportunity you know I don't think we do enough of a resource transfer if there is such a thing Uh-huh Uh-huh  Uh-huh They'll lose their ethnicity as they say yeah That's Uh-huh See Uh-huh Uh-huh It sounds like you probably know qui- I mean to this day are you still in touch with any native Puerto Ricans that you have made friends with or No that's natural I just thought I'd ask that because I wondered what you thought they might think Because I really don't have any personal or professional or familial ties down there I don't know the people that I went to high school with I think the majority are in probably the generation yours and mine and the one right after us their parents did not want to acclimate to the United States in terms of retaining and my background's European heritage and their background it would be you know we- I guess I would say the or Latino heritage Not speaking in English having the children drive them everywhere and these were not old people These were like in their early forties and that always bothered me and then there were some children that I noticed as soon as all the kids were out of high school I mean they went back to Puerto Rico to live You know they had made enough money here But on the other hand I guess it's all about choice in everything was it I mean how were they toward that's interesting the term you used continentals which I'm sure is the proper term How were they toward the United States in terms of just general relationships I mean were they glad Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh I know what you're talking about yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I don't predict what you're describing is actually a conflict very dif- hello you know what I've got to go because that's my cordless battery going I'm sorry I enjoyed talking to you and thank you for your time Okay bye-bye
