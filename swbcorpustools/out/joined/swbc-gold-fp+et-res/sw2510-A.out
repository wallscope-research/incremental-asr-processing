Okay do you have any pets boy Sound like us we have go ahead what kind is it so you he's got a blue tongue Oh We have two Chows and a miniature Schnauzer and recently added a guinea pig which wasn't by my choice but I was out ruled but the dogs are mainly mine and my husb- but I just love them to death Daughter yes Yes as if the dogs weren't enough had to have a guinea pig so anyway she enjoys her though so that's what matters But our Chows we've had them I'd say right around six maybe seven years and they're registered and we've been breeding them She's had about four or five litters Oh Right Uh-huh man Goodness It's telling you know when we had a cat when we first married no took yeah we had the cat first and then we got the Chow And bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her And you would think you know that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and paw at their face and they'd just play and they never harmed her So they got along great now I don't know how it would be bringing in like cat to a full grown dog Yeah Right I think so too Five <> She's a real Right And I was not really concerned about them harming her I think a lot of that we hear all the time is how you bring them up And ours are real friendly they're protective but they're very friendly and lovable I mean you think they're lapdogs You know they'll just come jump on your lap and want to have their bellies rubbed and everything and the female's red and the male is black Yeah he's a big old thing And I was concerned about the female mainly and as luck had it she had puppies the same week my daughter was born so it was kind of like she had her babies and understood about you know yeah and that yeah I think that really helped my daughter you know since she's little has been playing with them and they let her tug their hair and get on their back or whatever and she's grown up with them and loves them to death and they love her so I do too Yeah Yeah exactly that or the other extreme they're terrified of them and I hate that and they shouldn't be I mean some maybe but like our miniature Schnauzer she's just like a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly and a lot of kids are scared of that which I understand because she is you know a lot of movement and everything but when she calms down they're so scared of her it's that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing she wouldn't you know harm them at all and that's mainly people that have never had pets around their children so I think it's a good idea to have them in the past we've had birds too like Cockatoos And parrots and The big white birds with the orange crest on top We've had those and those are neat they're very messy yeah and loud a lot louder than a dog you know a dog you can tell stop barking you know or whatever But the birds it's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever but they were neat enjoyable animals to have Uh-huh Yeah with a lid yeah they Yes yes they are and in your the luck of keeping them alive through those first you know few days I know they are no Right I don't blame you there I think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than I don't know those fish are just beautiful Just so like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something Rather than just little fish But I don't mind having Wren my daughter had like a little goldfish about a year or two ago and it finally died and that was neat and they're you know she can't play with it you can just look at it You know you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat and Yeah Uh-huh no no Yes yeah and that's hard That's right and they're so independent I love having them for that reason Sure Uh-huh Uh-huh That's right that is hard Oh Yes Uh-huh fun no Oh no no I guess you didn't get your deposit back did you good okay no Bless your heart Uh-huh Sure Yeah Yes it is No no I wish it was I wish they were in that instinct But they don't Our only problem with our Schnauzer she's an indoor dog most of the time and we found she's right at a year and we finally got her you know house trained and everything her only problem is trash If you do not pick the trash up you know the container and put it on a table or chair or something she'll knock it over I don't care how full she is so it's not like she's hungry it's just she wants to get into trouble Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I hate that Yeah you shouldn't have left it there I just hate that when she does that I just and she knows it's wrong you'll walk in the door and she'll cower and go hide under the table So she knows she does wrong But she continues to do it so Uh-huh is he
