Well I feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately that I think there are some occupations such as the health field the transportation field they're already doing it in the armed forces where they handle weapons and so forth they do it to prisoners so I feel like it should be mandatory in some professions and I think if an employer feels that he wants to drug test employees and they don't like it then they should not be employed there That was you know I would not mind it Right Uh-huh unless an employer has a reason to believe that the work competency of the employee is hurting the business I mean maybe it's Number one because generally if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft and as an employer I would think that would be and the first it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost There's no way but my concern is school bus drivers I'm not even I'm in education I'm not even opposed to it for that I'm concerned in the medical field I think they should screen for alcohol in these areas too because I consider that a drug Right Right Right But when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus or a train and it doesn't take that long They don't have to be totally roaring drunk just a little off on their timing could mean life okay Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh my word Control Right Well as long as you accept that it is a random testing you know to alleviate that way you can't feel like somebody's out to get me If it's almost like being selected for jury duty You know so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel that's just the way it is I would rather have it that way to know that I was chosen at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in because I think when you let other employees turn in people Right Right So I would really rather know however there's got to be some backup to say that if somebody does observe you say at a party using drugs I would think that it would be their obligation to report that Personnel or something Right Right Right I don't know what kind of work you do but there would be even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way Right Right Right it's especially given today the drug abuse that goes on I just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put at risk slash error Because they're the ones who are going to have the lawsuits the insurance claims et cetera and I'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse Right Right  Uh-huh uh-huh  To see how that's is it just a small group of the employees that are concerned they just don't want to be drug tested You know my husband and I have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested my husband's retired from I R S agents However this isn't a problem that we have either alcohol or drug and so in our minds we're thinking what's the big deal Right and then they say well if you give them the right to do this then they're going to take some other right away from you but I firm- I think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything and of course one of the big deals now too is that when you come into a company you sign a paper saying that I will go take a
