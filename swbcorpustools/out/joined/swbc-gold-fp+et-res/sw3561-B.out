All right well Right are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term Yeah I think that you're absolutely right there The other thing is is that we've got all these bank defaults going on and savings and loan defaults and Right Exactly Exactly so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come I'm not really sure that I even understand why the administration is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if they're talking about reducing the tax that needs to be paid or the tax that's currently being paid then it seems to me it can't possibly you know help with the deficit picture Yeah exactly Yeah exactly Yeah it seems like it's a kind of a Catch Twenty-two I mean it's the my understanding is what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes they'll have more money to spend and if they have more money to spend then that will be a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity which in turn will generate revenue But it seems like it's sort of an unending spiral and it I'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the idea that decreasing taxes particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to result in substantial amounts of money you know for consumers to spend And Yeah it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do Uh-huh Uh-huh I think that's been a positive development I think what that's done is it's help keep inflation from Yeah exactly It's a sort of a piece of luck Yeah I don't know what kind of things do you think can be done in the long term Sure Uh-huh Right I think that I agree with you certainly in the second situation and I think certain entitlements I'm inclined to agree with you too Education happens to be one place where I think that we would foolish to Uh-huh I see what you're saying and then the people default on the loans Well I would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that around and I can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing but taking what you're saying at face value then I would have to agree with completely
