Go ahead Do you work for T I Oh okay all right Well see we have the testing already here We've had it for about five years It used to just be for new employees And now it's for all employees They randomly select employee numbers and the day that they select you is when you have to go and be tested So we're familiar with it we have a lot of people upset about it at the beginning Some not all But what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse mainly the areas where they were doing a lot of manufacturing type things and what they ended up doing is kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing you know on the premises Well yeah it was you know combination of both activities and using too so they developed this drug policy to eliminate there's some parts of the company that we do government contracts and I think some of those require the drug testing but now T I thought well we'll just do it for all employees not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in and that we shouldn't have people on drugs within our you know offices and such I haven't personally ever been tested but I don't have a problem with it No but one thing that to me was going on stretching it a little too far was that they also check if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug You know it happens a lot of times like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever and you know then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the you know doctor and get another prescription Well according to what they do at T I if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name you know it can't be in your spouse's name so I mean the testing will look for I guess any kind of drugs and you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for Right Yes yes When you get tested you are supposed to tell them you know everything that might be there And then if they ever question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name Well what they be testing for are the ones that would have like you know barbiturates or codeine things like that in them Right right I guess that's what they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and antibiotics and stuff They would be looking for the yeah controlled things barbiturates amphetamines Right right You pretty much you know put down what you remember even if it was just Contact or something like that But afterwards maybe if you had a controlled substance Well you probably put down you know you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it No I'm just saying you probably put down on the sheet anything you have taken But if they had a controlled substance maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name I know I had one contract employee through Manpower was not a T I person but was a contract person and they test them too even if you are not a real T Ier If you are a contract employee here they test you too And he had taken some kind of you know just he had some kind of flu or something He got a real bad migraine and he took his mother's
