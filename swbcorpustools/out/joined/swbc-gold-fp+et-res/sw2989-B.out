Well yeah I feel much the same way I've two kids right now one is two and a half and one's nine months and that age of course everything you do they're trying to learn to do and so it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn you know that they need to learn at the age you know reading and playing nice with others and that sort of thing Right uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah it certainly does because you know the things in the books seem so dead to the kids you know unless they've actually been there or whatever because I remember our family well we went everywhere And seeing New England and being on Plymouth Rock and stuff like that really made the whole thing more visual And we could read the things in the history books and understand what they said when it was like we need to raise food quickly because this place gets very cold very soon Right because if kids don't look up to you or can't feel they can spend time with you they're going to find someone else and you know nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid emulating or whatever Yeah that is nice Yeah well it's ten o'clock here in Falls Church Virginia So that the only reason I'm home is because I'm home with a cold And the wife says Well you need something to do talk to a guy on the phone Yeah Right Yeah I'm an electrical engineer by trade here in Virginia Likewise we do some projects every now and then We like to get support from other companies as well Oh Yep Okay Right Bye-bye
