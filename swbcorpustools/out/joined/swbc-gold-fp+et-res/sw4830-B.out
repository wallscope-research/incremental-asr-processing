No you can start Uh-huh Right Right this topic is kind of mute there's no way we couldn't survive in a trial system without a jury one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult <> Right Right They shouldn't allow an appeal Yep Uh-huh that's right I work for a law firm Right Well plea bargaining is a different story Plea bargaining is something completely different that actually prevents trials Or at least speeds them up Right Right  Right We do Right Right When you're saying as far as the appeal procedure was concerned We just have the case I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry his last appeal was denied two days before his sentence was up So I mean his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession But that was absurd there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence Well the only I wa- you know the appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of like I said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd There's no way that could work but exactly Exactly Right No one would want the job and you know like I said you know everyone has their opinions about every case yeah I feel that everyone is entitled to a trial by jury that right s- Well I mean were there witnesses Right Right That you can't remove the jury regardless of the case I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place and there's still mitigating circumstances
