Uh-huh Yeah Yeah you know that's a good way to approach it I've never thought about I do plan my clothes a week in advance Actually I plan them a month in advance I usually do a month at a time so I don't repeat an outfit But I've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on Monday because really no one's paying attention But anyway I don't work outside of school I work in the computer lab at school so I can just wear whatever I have on for school and really it's I try to dress presentable but very comfortable Like in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that and then in the winter time it's jeans or pants I usually you know college is so casual you really don't want to dress up unless you have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that so Yeah Uh-huh Oh Well that's good that they're so casual I mean my brother works for T I and he's a or computer engineer And you know whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear a tie or a dress shirt everyday But he goes to work in his blue jeans t-shirt and tennis shoes and he just loves it Yeah That's what I've heard But I mean they just moved into the new building he calls it the new building I don't know it's where all the executives are and so they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans But he just left for Italy today at four and he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them I mean for T I but over in Italy yeah he was so excited about going But he didn't carry any ties or anything because he just went over there with that attitude well if I don't take it then they won't make me wear it Because he didn't you know he's not really into all that He would wear it if he had to for his job and all but you know I mean his preference is blue jeans and a t-shirt so But I think that's great about T I and also to get off the clothing the smokers you know how they have the different designated areas for smokers and stuff I think that's great really Do you smoke Uh-huh I think that's Well you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college Well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions and See that's how I am but my mamma was not raised like that and so me to boy I have to hunt them down Uh-huh That's great I wanted to take a sewing class at school but I just haven't fit it into my schedule yet but I mean that can really benefit that's something that I'd be very interested in learning they're outrageous Uh-huh Yeah it's marked up it is really outrageous but I mean like whenever I was growing up and all my mom I never understood this then but I do now but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that and she always told me it was because I was still growing and she wasn't going to buy me something I was going to grow out of next week Yeah no Uh-huh That's the best way to shop I mean I always thought my mom was being mean to me but I look back at it now and my child is going to I mean I'm going to raise mine the same way I don't know they're just so outrageously priced it's just incredible I try to always catch the sales Always Yeah it depends on yeah there's always a reason why they're on sale So that has a lot to do with it But well  Uh-huh that's great Uh oh no Uh-huh The defect Uh-huh T J Max does that yeah we have a T J Max over here and
