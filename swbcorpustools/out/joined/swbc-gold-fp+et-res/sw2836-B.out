Uh-huh well I don't actually live in the city but I'd probably say that's roughly right I mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life but I think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff I'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution and sale of drugs Uh-huh where I live now it's not so bad I mean I can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it but I do have friends that live in the city and I think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing just because there are like crack houses you know on their street and stuff like this I live out in the country yeah I'm about fifteen miles out Uh-huh   Uh-huh Uh-huh Wow That's huge Uh-huh Uh-huh are there any theories on why this is happening Uh-huh But why Why is it happening Uh-huh Uh-huh So they're professionals  Uh-huh Uh-huh  Well what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime Uh-huh Uh-huh Right But I mean that's going to tend to I mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher in other words you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit The real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place Right They're doing that in our state too So you think that would be a deterrent Uh-huh Well what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty Right So you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody Uh-huh Uh-huh  Right wow my goodness Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Wow did you sue him under the civil system Did you sue him under the civil system Well you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something right and try to get money from him and Yeah Makes you wish that still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing But they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt Yeah that's too bad Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I think that's re- Yeah Yeah That's awful <> Gives you sympathy for the vigilantes Yeah Uh-huh my God Right Right Uh-huh Right Uh-huh And that's a deterrent too If you think the home owner might be armed right and awake here you break in and you're going to get shot Uh-huh Uh-huh  Wow Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh I mean I tend to agree with you I think what I would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and worry about these things where people are getting hurt And I think one of the big things that you can do to increase deterrence is if someone is found guilty of a felony level offense they lose their citizenship And they lose their constitutional rights You know and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just don't protect them I know and I think that's ridiculous
