Okay Well what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody I think they should I know I had a job until let's see a year ago this past December I was working for P I E and they closed and naturally while I was working for them I had health insurance but for me to try to get it now it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at P I E Right it really is and you know I think God the government should come up with some kind of a health plan or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high Well the thing is you know jobs are so hard to find you know and then what you can get out here in anyhow in the valley where I live at now they don't want to pay anything for health insurance at all No benefits you know Yes I mean you get a job now and the wages are really low and Yeah and they don't want to pay any benefits so you just you know pray to God that you don't get sick Uh-huh Uh-huh No I don't understand that either Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well I know the plan that I had with P I E I could go to any doctor and I could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled you know then I just sent cards in and then they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine and then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that you know Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh  Yeah that's true that's true there Well Yeah right Uh-huh But there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything you know that people that's on unemployment I don't Yeah probably so I don't know but it does seem to be a big problem you know I don't know what they're going to come up with but I sure wish they would come up with something and like I say and I'm at the age too where the I'll be fifty-seven in June and the people don't want to hire people this age any more And I worked for my previous company for twenty-six years you know so it's kind of hard you know so Yeah they'll be calling at my door But anyhow Yeah now I do think the government though is going to have to do something with this problem because you know even to go to a little doctor out here just to ask him anything costs you forty bucks you know just for the visit And then he then that's not counting what medicine you're going to buy and everything else you know And he might tell you well you know now you're going to have to come back in a week and then that's another forty bucks plus whatever else he decides to do to you
