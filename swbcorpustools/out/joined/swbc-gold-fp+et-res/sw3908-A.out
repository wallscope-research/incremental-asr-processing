Alright Allen the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations and you know in the society we live in What do you think has occurred there Uh-huh But are they being given the full honor for the work they are doing and my gosh I can't think of the word what they have to accept that's they are responsible for responsibilities is what I am trying to say Uh-huh By the same token in most cases women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before but at lower salaries Is that right and wrong Yes Uh-huh Yeah Well what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years Any individual thing or is it just a general switch over Uh-huh I have a feeling that business with the woman working out at the same level of responsibility as their husband sort of tears into their social or their loving relationship In that the lady needs to stand up for what she has made and her own rights and has a right to do so and this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household So do you think that is going to be difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years Uh-huh Well do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation specifically Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes Well I actually mo- a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they are going to get And the people Well how do you feel about women in armed services Yeah  Yeah I somehow can't do that I was brought up in the ages where the ladies were kept home safe secure and made happy and the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household and it really still bothers me I spent plenty of years in the service but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around I mean how are they going to protect themselves so to speak It puts them in a very bad situation I really don't go for that Uh-huh Yep Well that's not fair Because I can tell you one thing stay home sometime and start doing some of those jobs that she's been handling and you're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going Yeah Yeah And if they go into the work force they should be treated as nicely as well as a man or any other person And not
