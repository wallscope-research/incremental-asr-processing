advice on son or daughter going to college that's advice that I will need in time future for my children rather than one that I have personal experience with I suppose I would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet those needs What advice would you give I guess one clear-cut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus stay in a dormitory if you can Go to classes talk to faculty members and students Yes I'm thinking what problems my children might have in that but I agree with you Uh-huh Yeah Well course <> it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and you're willingness one to work during the summer or part time And to take out loans to assume debt after college Yes Mine is twelve That's my gut feeling too I my son is certainly not persuaded of that <> Hello yeah yes I didn't have a car in college I think it's more a burden to provide for Is it I didn't do any of those though I feel less strongly about the T Vs and refrigerators
