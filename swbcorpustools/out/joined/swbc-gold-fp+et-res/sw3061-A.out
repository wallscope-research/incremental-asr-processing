Okay well right now we have one dog inside She goes out but I mean she's an indoor dog And two outside cats Male and female The ma- the dog is probably about thirteen fourteen years old And the cats they might be as old I'm not sure Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh is that right What kind of dog do you have that's what ours is Yes White uh-huh I'll be darned Uh-huh Oh Yeah Uh-huh Well that's to be expected at their age Yeah Well everybody always says no more But I think animals are really important in the family I yeah we have five Well we had had a dog before She was fifteen when she died And this one we bought by accident a farmer called us and wanted us to call or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that somebody people drop things like that off up there and I said "Gee she sounds like a cute little dog" I told the kids "Let's go look at her" Go get her So that's how we got her quite by accident Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Oh Oh She picked us Uh-huh Oh Oh Uh-huh for heaven's sake No But they say it's real important for children to have pets because well they can go and talk to them any time they want to and tell them anything they want to and nobody is going to you know reprimand them or know their secrets or Yeah Yes And the nursing homes now they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home Uh-huh our one nursing home in has one Permanent he kind of has free run of the place and there is or somebody takes care of him But he goes out people and real nice dog and Uh-huh Uh-huh really Oh Yeah Is that right Yeah because most campuses don't allow pets you know they just do not allow them that's kind of great Yeah Yes yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh  uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah we've ruined them They say ruined them Well we've had a lot of different pets the kids had rabbits for pets and we also raised them for food at one time And We've had a skunk for a pet For more years than I want to think about She was in the house Well don't ever get one for a pet They're okay but like she they don't ever learn their name you could never call her and she would come to you you had to go chase her down And their eyesight they can't see very far either But They before we got her everybody said "Oh they're just like a cat" you know And they're not I mean they use the litter box That's about it my how long Probably seven or eight years And finally my children are the ones who said "Mom you've put up with that skunk long enough" so we moved her to the basement and I don't think she was there a week till the men built her a pen outside And I thought I put up with that all those years And we've had cats stay in the house we had two Siamese cats Different times one of them ran off She ran off once or he I guess it was a male he ran off twice and the second time he never came back And we would see him several miles from our house he kind of moved into a woods down there And he got huge down there He really grew but he never came back Well he wasn't a whole lot He was in the house most the time but he did go out sometimes and they ma- it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside Yeah the cats my son has a cat and the vet had told us they get strange if they're kept in the house all the time And their cat was not a friendly cat it was not a good I don't know it got it did get strange And since they've moved to where they let the cat out And it has improved the personality
