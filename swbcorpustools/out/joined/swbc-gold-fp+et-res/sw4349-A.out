The last auto repair I had was I have a nineteen eighty-four Nissan truck I had a tune up done and I had the brakes done on it and then the reason I did that was because I don't have a scope and it has eight spark plugs and it's hard to get at them and plus the time on them I just don't have time any more as far as maintenance tasks that I do myself I usually change the oil and wash the air filter and I had an occasion to have to change the battery once but I was really surprised that the brakes I wanted I do have the background I know what needs to be done and I know that the oil should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings and the lubrication system needs to be lubricated and so I stay on top of that but I wanted my front wheels I wanted the bearings packed and they wanted something like fifteen dollars a front or something like that or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it just to pack the bearings but what I found is that they had a brake job and they I had them the other thing I let them do some times is that I let them go through and let them do the diagnostics That's free okay And then I can decide whether I want them to do it or whether I can do it see And they told me that my brake pads were gosh you know seventy percent still good you know but still it was cheaper in the long run and so I just got the the brakes done and I thought that was a good deal And plus and they repacked the the wheel bearings Yeah but I've had considerable experience you might say I'm good back yard mechanic and you know I took auto shop in high school it's been a while back but I still have a pretty good feel for it but one thing I didn't know is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars I had bigger cars and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those and what I was surprised at is that on my little Nissan I bought the truck with about sixty thousand I have almost one hundred and ten so I drove on those brake pads for you know forty-five thousand miles and there was hardly any wear to them So those small little trucks and cars like that the longevity of the brake pads is really good Exactly so you know I just did it anyway I like to stay up on it You know like I just kind of stay up on it and then if you go and like just about any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is you might say a white golden brown You know it's not dirty I keep it that way because that is the key to the longevity so how Uh-huh Oh oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Okay Uh-huh <> You're talking about the vibration dampener That's the vibration dampener yeah Okay  Uh oh  Uh oh  Uh-huh
