Well I almost forgot the topic I was waiting so long for it to find somebody Right well so what is your favorite T V show you like that one Uh-huh I've never really watched that one You know it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows and you know there's only a few that I like to watch routinely Probably my favorite is well I like shows like GROWING PAINS and what's the other one now they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night so I don't get to watch it very much WONDER YEARS yeah that's my favorite Yeah WONDER YEARS I guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when I was growing up or whatever I guess I can really relate to it and it's just a real cute show I guess I like the shows that really have a real sense of I don't know honesty or sort of a purity value I guess Uh-huh Yeah Right right Uh-huh yeah my wife really likes that show Uh-huh Yeah Yeah well there was but there's a sense of I guess purity in the show like one of my favorite shows used to be HAPPY DAYS but you know Richie always used to be you know just so honest and pure I guess and when he left the show you know it seemed to be missing that part of it and I never did like it after that so I don't know I see the same thing in like WONDER YEARS and a lot of the shows that I like to watch There always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere Yeah uh-huh Uh-huh So you're going to watch a game tonight So do you have a favorite for the series or anything uh-huh Yes Yeah he's a nice guy I take it you live in the Dallas area Do you live in the Dallas area Uh-huh yeah I live in Garland and yeah I like Steve Bushel but I don't really like the Pirates I'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan so I'm kind of pulling for the Braves over all they've come from so far down I really would like to see them do well Yeah one year they maybe they'll make it I don't know but yeah I like sports programming quite a bit but I guess my favorite shows are the and you know that getting back to the point that you made that's really true we were watching ROSEANNE I guess couple of weeks ago and her daughter was talking about birth control you know and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time and you know she's only seven years old so Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah Yeah well that seems to be more our values too like the WONDER YEARS I mean it's kind of risque stuff maybe for teenagers you know and you can kind of relate to it you know I don't know that's I enjoy that a lot but you know I agree with you the and it's funny because the shows like a lot of them that used to be considered risque like THREE'S COMPANY and stuff I think they maintained people would watch them because you know there was really the period that was going on there I mean he really wasn't messing around with the girls but everybody perceived him that way and stuff but as soon as you know he went to move in with another girl the show just died and it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way
