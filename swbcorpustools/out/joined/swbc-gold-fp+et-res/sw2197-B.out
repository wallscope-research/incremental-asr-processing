Well I'd encourage it It's a good general education for a bachelor's degree and obviously it's where they don't have any post graduate program there but you get an excellent wide basis of topics You know you get a good broad education out of it they don't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors but maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there  Well for some people it's good because maybe they need a little discipline need a little reining in at that stage in their life other people it's suffocating you know you kind of choke on it it depends on the individual but the one factor I think more than anything else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just the cost how much you're going to pay no matter where you go to school And if you've been in for twelve years I'm sure you've you've got your share of student loans that you're probably going to be paying off or have been or Uh-huh that's good I mean I know people or that I went to high school with that went to civilian colleges and they've got twenty thirty thousand dollar debts I mean you could have Yeah Exactly it's staggering when you think that just here in central New York is Hamilton College is just you know maybe about twenty miles to the south from where I am and they're looking for twenty-two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now A year At just a small I mean it is a select college yeah But you're talking incredible tuitions now I don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot Very few I would imagine But I get I just couldn't ima- I mean it's more money that I make in a year so You know it you know me being one person with a above the median income for New York state you know I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now and I even as a somebody making twice what I was making how could you put half of that to your child's education and then just when they make it to the college years it's My God I can't imagine Yes Or it's also a good environment it may be good for someone who already has self discipline who has a certain amount of leadership quality in their own that And that yeah the s- it's the same It can benefit different people different ways But you know I agree with that because I see people that I know again from high school that I still keep in touch with that didn't go to college and they do the same old things they did in high school andneeds slash because following utt by B repeats utt of A; is not necessarily the intended end of this utt Same patterns of behavior same socializing same exact crowd that they hang with and it's like frozen time you know It is It really is that they haven't found anything better that or their experiences haven't been broadened at all to you know you know it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions and you hear all these different sides of the story that you never thought of and that's another big thing I think people get out of college is the appreciation for differing points of view you know or different opinions Yeah exactly yeah I Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Well your education's a lot what you make of it too so Yeah Well I've seen more graduates from M I T and that being I work an Air Force laboratory and so we've got a lot of M I T graduates that are in there and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that I think I've ever run into even more so like military academy grads are a strange lot too I mean I have to confess to that Yeah and they have their own quirks and tolerances and you know certain things that don't bother us at all that would drive other people nuts and then certain things that things we do the way we do it that drive other people nuts that But these M I T grads are off in their absolute own world it's a I have a lot of respect for M I T master's and doctorate degrees but they're undergrads are like I'm amazed at that's a lot of them even graduated But I don't know Right Right Nope Yeah No It's interesting that you mention and I didn't think about that before when you were talking but the service academies have all the faculty for the most part is military with a few exchange professors from other schools But having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there is investing in the Air Force and it or the military itself it's the future officer corps and so I hear horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors they could never get extra help For me any time I needed extra help any time of the day I had all my instructors home phone numbers and could call them you go to their office anytime I had some instructors that would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends when I was having trouble with something and No no and that No Right right Publish first and the Right Yeah Yeah there's a lot of factors that people don't ever consider in their selection of a college and I don't know maybe I wonder if they enter these conversations that people have been having
