That's right that's right You know what do you think is important If you were I don't know how old you are but if you had parents say or grandparents whatever it is who were ready who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for  Yeah Yeah  Well my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in Minnesota and we go there once a year we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston so we're pretty far away When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her And it seems I mean the environment there I don't know too much about it but it seems nice enough it's hard at least half of the residents I would say are not mentally sound So it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to retain clarity say you know Yeah Well I don't know we also my wife and I volunteer to go to a nursing home that's just a mile from our house she goes more often than I We used to go once every two months to visit some of the patients there And we have a two year old son and so sometimes we'd take him with us And there I would say it's the same thing it's a relatively nice environment but again it must be depressing for the people who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but certainly have retained all of their mental skills and so on It's must be depressing to walk the halls and see all these other people who really don't know where they are I think yeah I think they're relatively respectful Yeah and concerned in as much as they can be you know I've noticed some of the patients asking for things just repetitively but things that are not reasonable and so at some level the I'm sure that the staff learn what's normal for this person and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person you know is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need you know yeah Yeah I'll tell you one thing though that I saw that was really nice We saw a husband and wife we used to see a husband and wife in there together and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were but these two were And when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house And so Yeah you walked in there and it didn't look like you know how you walk into some rooms and it's completely generic There's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person and that's it But this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that and they had all their stuff from their house and it looked like it must have been it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them and it must also give them a sense of security and you know s- Yeah  Yeah  temporary I that's new to me I Right right
