not at all In fact I'm graduating from college in about a week and this past semester I've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials I think the system right now you know you know is fine I think it should be by a jury I don't think the judge should have I mean he's just there kind of like the referee I don't even think that it should be unanimous either Uh-huh Right Exactly Uh-huh I don't know I you hear of course there's cases where someone has been put in prison falsely accused but more than likely the people that are on the jury know what they're doing I mean you Never Well you would think that they would get that in the when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out and I know they automatically when you're chosen is you're automatically like a professor in criminal justice or something like that that you're automatically no they don't want you on the jury Exactly Uh-huh exactly  Uh-huh Uh-huh I've never even been called to jury duty Yeah <> I don't know I guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Ri- I don't think the judge should just make the decision alone Least with the jury you have twelve people you know that are going to decide you know you're the person's fate This really is part of utt1  Exac- judge Right exactly Probably yeah Yeah But no it's sad though the people though that somebody's life is in twelve people's hands and sometimes those twelve people could care less or they fool the defense in thinking that they're you know because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want Exactly Uh-huh yeah Well I guess it's just that maybe people are you know upset at court you know if it was a family member of theirs though that was innocent and then they'd want to be on that jury But I think if everyone took it seriously and I mean something you have to do This really seems to be just a continuation of B68 not an indep slash unit  Yeah I would love to be called I'm ready to go They just haven't called me up yet It was nice talking to you Bye-bye
