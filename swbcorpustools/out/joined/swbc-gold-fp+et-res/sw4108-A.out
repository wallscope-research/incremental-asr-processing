so what do you think about putting the elderly in a nursing home  Uh-huh <> That's true Yeah <> Uh-huh That's true I never thought of that Yeah That's true until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with Yes They really are They don't like to keep them longer than a week Yeah What do you mean Yeah that's true Yeah and it depends on how sick the person is too What you're capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own Yeah I would personally like it if my parents were to get ill I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help That's not always possible But to the best of my ability I'd like to do it until it gets impossible Right Uh-huh <> Yeah That's true Yeah But I think nursing homes can be good It just depends on what kind they are You know you need to check them out ahead of time Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that they're Yeah Right Who know what they're doing with that Yeah well my grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it And she really liked the idea of moving there She's not ill yet but she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years and then she decided she's eighty five years old that eventually you know she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden She's very independent So she's in this nursing home It's out in the country and she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook Uh-huh Right Some support And then there's also sort of a wing for those people that do get sick and what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now and then so if she ever does become ill it will be like family around her Yeah Uh-huh <> Yeah Sh- Uh-huh <> No she loves it She has a great social life and she travels and it's in the mountains and it's beautiful and I hope that I have something like that when I get older <> Uh-huh <> Uh-huh definitely it's Right
