Okay what do you think is the biggest problem Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the values they get from home Right Yeah I think that the biggest problem is with the home environment being part of it You know if I think too many parents expect the school to teach the moral aspects of things to the kids you know while we're not going to worry about teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then expect them to pick it up at school you're not going to do that you know you're going to carry to school out into the world you know what you learned at home and I think that that part of that showing up now you know with things because kids I think have probably less respect for people in other things than we may have seen in the past and part of it's the family I think and part of it's the living conditions certain people are subjected too drugs is a big problem now and I think that's another root problem Uh-huh Right Right Well I think like you say it's the socioeconomic mix they're you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids that might be more well off you know going to a private Catholic school or whatever and they're not all that way but you know some that are they're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city you know public schools Yeah Yeah well you know in a lot of cases like that where you know if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education I think it shows that the parents have some desire for the kid to do well you know and that may be passed on down to the kid as well and maybe they pick up on that And then from the other aspect maybe the school itself has more emphasis on trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller they may be able to give the resources that's needed to do a good job that's a tough question how to fix the school system with I would try I guess to see about getting parents more involved try to come up with more ways to do that stress the importance of education to both the parents and the students and more classes I think that are and I think this is happening some around the country in terms of morals trying to teach the kinds of things that aren't getting taught at home and respect for other people I think that's a big part of it You know people you know if you don't care about property and people you know you're not going to care about learning I think You know you're not going to really care about yourself Right Well you know and I but that's not an easy task you know that's why I say it's a tough question what would you do +  because you know even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when you're growing up you know in a home which may be just the pits and you don't have any kind of a good environment to live in you know it's kind of hard to say well you need to take care of other people's stuff as well when you barely have anything yourself So I could see where that would be a problem and I think it's
