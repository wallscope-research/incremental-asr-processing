Well what are your do you use credit cards Huh-uh So it doesn't get the credit the interest rate is so high that you're really if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy I think don't you Otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's not a very good idea Well I have a lot of them but I don't use them very much though I use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes tuition you know if I'm short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as I can The other thing I think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off more than one at a time because I think you could run forever paying what they require Just goes on and on Yeah Yeah that's true There are times when it's very useful like emergency trip or something Sometimes when you the money will be available but it's you know not immediately handy I think they're very helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes But you really do need to be very responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble Uh-huh Right Right That can be very handy under those kind of circumstances The other thing about them is too you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and haven't developed a credit thing It stops you from doing a lot of things if you pay for everything by cash there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or a car so they have become a very vital part of our monetary system over the last few years But it's true you have to be very careful or you end up going in the deep end and an awful lot of people are in trouble We have a boy living with us who works for a credit card company that and he makes calls to people who have problems you know credit problems that are trying to work out and Poor thing he comes home very depressed every night because the world has so many problems of that sort so it's a really big problem I think and takes mature people to treat it so that it's a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage Yeah Right It didn't do you any good now does it Even before it probably wasn't though because you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying So well I'm not other than that I don't have too much on credit cards but It's good to talk to you Uh-huh bye now
