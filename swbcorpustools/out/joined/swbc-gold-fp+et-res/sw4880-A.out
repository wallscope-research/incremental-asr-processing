Well yeah I'm employed by a company that does do random drug testing and I've got some very definite opinions about it you know which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from when they announced it But developed a little more I guess but haven't changed that much What about you Are you involved at all Yes Yeah Right Yeah Yeah Yeah that's mine it you know I go back to me no matter how much our company claims it's not a constitutional issue That because this is between a company and an employee it is not a government it's not the Constitution doesn't apply But it seems to me that it still should our company's doing it because they're a government contractor and so it's required for certain + some form of drug program is required  to get the government contracts and I'd slash error Yes Okay and our company has taken that and gone all the way Say okay first off we don't have enough courage to pick out the people that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage because that would offend them if they weren't So we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even and then and they so it's a complete random testing well it's random in the sense that you don't know when It is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested and you know I sit at a terminal and write software all day it certainly has no life threatening capabilities you know in my job and yes I agree that there are jobs that are definitely life threatening and there needs to be a line drawn somewhere reasonable and proper I- you know Well Yeah that I will give credit to our company for in that I think there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of drugs And essentially the first thing is on the order of paper in the urine or some you know it's not quite that simple but it's fairly simple Coarse kind of test And then there's a much more refined test spectrography or whatever it's called The chemotography to determine exactly what the things are And No I've been with this company for sixteen years now And No and it has you know they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody And at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't know But on the other hand someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test
