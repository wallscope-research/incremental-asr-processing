I do aerobics step classes and toning classes yes it's a new form I think it's like low impact aerobics but it Uh-huh Yeah you have a step and you literally step up on the step and move your arms it's new it's fun Uh-huh bad knee and I do toning a lot and some every once in a while I play tennis I'm not too great at it but I try to play Uh-huh Gosh Uh-huh Uh-huh Ha right ye- yeah I slacked off a little because of I'm about to graduate from college and so this past couple months have been really hectic so I haven't really gone and I've really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out but I'm at East Carolina But no I my step classes and toning is about the only thing well I mean It's like isolated movements for certain muscles groups you can do with Yeah you know you can do it with weights if you wanted to but you know you leave out of there usually the next morning if you haven't done it in a while you wake up the next morning you're like no what did I do to myself and your whole body aches you know I know I'm looking forward to getting back into getting into shape I feel like I'm out of shape but I feel guilty for not going because I'm so used to going for you know three or four years now But Uh-huh yeah yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh No some I walk a lot because you know being in school we I don't know if your campus was anything like ours but our parking lot's in one end of the campus and the buildings are all at the other end so You ut- Uh-huh okay that's if Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah it's I live on the second story apartments so I walk up and down stairs all day long so  Yeah That's one of the exercise now I would like to start running I've never been much of a runner but I want to start I want to run but I don't know if I'll be able to do it I'm afraid I won't be able to I wish I'd Yeah I hope not Uh-huh I don't even own a bike I think the last time I was on a bike when I was about twelve so I don't know I'd be afraid I probably forgot how to ride a bike you know Yeah but no I guess that's about the only form I'm trying to think of other things that I do that will be considered exercise there are things I should do I know it ju- Uh-huh Uh-huh Those aerobic classes are tough the high impact Definitely are tough classes Uh-huh Uh-huh Well now they have those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight you have like bands I don't know if you've seen them they're weird they're just made of I guess it's different kinds of rubber and they get Uh-huh And there's some that like the different colors denotes how much the tension I guess they are and how easy they are to move I know there's purple gray and green And some of them are real short and they're the ones that are the tough ones to use you know But those classes I enjoy I think with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that's fun If you don't have one that's fun and not acting like she's enjoying what she's doing the class is not going to get out what they should get out of the class if the I'm an interior design major Oh No no no no I could never do that I don't think I'd rather just be the student And Occasionally I do the weights at the health club but low weights just Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Well I just noticed at our health club they will put on these computerized machines and you set a speed on it and the weight and it makes you do it And it tells you like if you're going too slow it will say my grandmother could do this faster than you And stuff like a turtle goes faster and it tells it and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you Yeah So do stuff like that but just I've never used those machines I just use the regular machines and the free weights you know like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights Just to do you know some bicep tricep exercises Sit-ups of course Uh-huh yeah I think that's number one problem with everyone Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right Yeah I plan on getting back once I graduate next weekend Next weekend Yeah one week Then I plan to get right back into it You know it does a lot for you I think Makes you feel a lot better Uh-huh and I mean you feel so much better about yourself Just that you know you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner yeah yeah All righty well thank you It was nice talking to you Okay bye-bye
