Okay The question was what is your opinion of youth spending a year or two in public service Yeah Huh-uh would you be more in favor of you know like a local my only experience with it I was in Central America for a while and in San Salvador in El Salvador For instance everybody had what they called there social year that they had to put in and basically it was a repayment for high school education and most of them joined the Red Cross and it was done internally I just there was very little external I think possibly what they're thinking about here more external Peace Corps Type things where we're sending people off shore Huh-uh Yeah I don't know how the Peace Corps works I guess I was of age when the Peace Corps came in and all that Did you ever get any information on it like That's what I was wondering about was whether they actually Yeah Wasn't Jimmy Carter's mama that was in the Peace Corps Where they couldn't do that Yeah you might end up with a revolution I don't know which end though Yeah yeah that's been interesting though the kids that have been over you know coming back right now you know You wonder if being exposed to that for a while what percentage of them would actually say Hey that's not a bad way to do it because from what I understand from some of the guys I know you know crime is punishable just almost instantly and public yeah Public hanging and this sort of thing you know so you don't have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes Yeah Well I guess that's the price of freedom I guess is a little anyway the public service thing again I guess in my own having had the whole three or four minutes to you know give it a great deal of thought you know I think I agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary but when you do that then it becomes almost a or it can be You know there have people will kind of set up their own little club but if you know Yeah Yeah well if they went AWOL what are you going to do Shoot them Put them in jail Yeah right I know my dad always talked about he was in C C C during And he was a rock rib Iowa type republican and the only good thing he could ever say about the whole Roosevelt administration was civilian conservation corps because he was in it He thought that was great The rest of it was all hog wash but that was great Yeah Yeah the only Well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know who would determine what these people do You know you know if it's run by the individual state You know like C C C was run by the army and in effect and the only opposition to it really was that it was you know starting some sort of a military elitist type you know special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing And when the politics get real confusing Yeah Yeah Well We've gotten to the point where you know well if the racial make up of the group was such and such you know they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and you know That kind of thing yeah Suppose well you know they had a group who were construction oriented and they went and they built can't think of a good example a swimming pool or anything you know and you can only build it in one place you know and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream well you didn't build one over here Yeah I think boy It's one of those things on the surface you know it seems like a great idea It's like a joke I heard once about elephant foot soup you know it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot It's the logistics of the thing that gets you going Yeah Huh-uh Yeah Yeah Yeah it's just the you know here you are to the logistics of the thing again you know Who's going to run it you know what how it's just so many like I said at the beginning I've got so many connections with people in Central America My daughter-in-law is Panamanian you know and they have situations like that down there Where they have the social in some sort of way if you want to go to school outside the country {A and many Salvadorians did } they'd go to school in Cornell Iowa of all places and when they came back they'd have to serve this year and it turned out to be kind of a joke the ones I knew you know always chose the Red Cross because they didn't do anything And they had all kinds of things they could go into agricultural and you know Really good stuff but unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that Red Cross it was so many of them in it that your chance of having to do something it was very slim And so Huh-uh Huh-uh Yeah Okay Then that's kind of a private organization you know I'm familiar with my instructor pilot was a Mormon he was a good you know instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible Yeah right He felt that he really had an in so You know things he would do with an airplane but any rate that's off the subject But I Huh-uh I see how they were organized in Central and South America and it's
