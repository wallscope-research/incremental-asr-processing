Okay They suggested that we discuss what we think of when we say camping I can camp just about most anyway Camping or motor home is nice travel trailer pop up really Oh You really rough it then Uh-huh Do you do that very often Uh-huh Uh-huh You'd have a lot of hills down in that area Yeah That would be really great Pardon Uh-huh That sounds like it'd be fun Did you go alone or with a group or Uh-huh Uh-huh that's great Long as it's not raining Uh-huh Really that would be Huh-uh Well I'm in Pennsylvania Yes Are you in Texas now Oh Okay Most everybody I've been talking to is from Texas but we're up here in northwestern part of Pennsylvania Uh-huh Well you kind of know what it's like then Yeah But we've done many types of camping we've done tent camping and we had access to a motor home which is really super great if you don't want to rough it too much Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Just get you away from the everyday things that are going on when the children were smaller we used to go to Delaware along the ocean most every year And that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks and we really enjoyed that Huh maybe dropping my phone Is that better Oh But Yeah Well we used to we don't as much anymore but we used to We kind of slowed down a little bit But I think the worst thing is when it's raining If you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping then it can be kind of bad Uh-huh I don't think I would like that What kind Oh Those aren't too pleasant Yeah We have some of them around here You probably have more there though I would imagine Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh But you still backpacked and camped out Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing Yeah Yeah I would think a cave could have problems like that too Uh-huh Uh-huh is your brother younger than you or Uh-huh uh-huh well that's great that'd be a lot of fun You have a lot good experiences from that Yeah Did you really What black ones Yeah That would be exciting Yeah they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them usually They're on the increase in this area Uh-huh The black bear yeah Yeah the population's been really up they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them because they were increasing so much Uh-huh Yeah But we really like camping I must say that we really have a lot of fun a lot of memories in that from camping and Yeah Yeah so it's a lot of work too it's you know getting ready and taking care of everything But it's really refreshing So I think so Well it was really good hearing from you and I hope you get back into camping again and do a little more of it Okay Thanks a lot and you have a good day Bye-bye
