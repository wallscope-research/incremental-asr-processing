Well she lives in Utah so Yeah Okay let's do i- Uh-huh Okay No I don't I stay home most of the time but I know that it's very difficult to find good help sometimes when you want your children to be taken care of you know there's a my neighbor she tends children though and there's a big controversy whether they should have to have a law to have them certified or not And you know there's pros and cons on both side of that because if they were then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing or some kind of something to get an okay seal That's right That's right Yeah Uh-huh now usually when I have someone tend my oldest tends for me now if I go somewhere but before He's almost a teenager Yeah he's very good but before that I would use kids from our church and they did a good job for me but I've never had to leave them like in a day care center or anything and I've been very lucky just be able to stay home Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah that's hard Well some people aren't Yeah is that right I think that's really important Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah uh-huh Yeah yeah Oh uh-huh dear Oh Yeah Yeah I bet Uh-huh Well nannies have been an option but I know that at day care they have more of a routine like maybe in preschool would have where they have lessons and so forth and so on Uh-huh Uh-huh Gave you an idea of what your child was progressing in or doing Yeah Yeah Yeah I think so because if they were still there you know they might not Right right You can't really You can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something and usually they aren't at that age You know slash error Uh-huh Well I know about three years ago I tended some children And you know I wondered if I would have to be certified or whether they'd just bring them and we got to where well we were just friends and so they said no don't do that we'll just bring them And then if there was a problem and then we'd sit down and talk about it but it never happened to be a problem and so things worked out okay and their kids played with my kids and it worked out well Oh That's great uh-huh Well that will be great Yeah Yeah I bet you'll have some great experiences with them Yeah Sure why not and you know the grandparents I always hear it's always fun when you can send them home at the end of the day instead of having to slash error So slash error That's right Well my husband's mother lives right over here and she takes care of them sometimes for me and just is a lovely lady and I've always appreciated when she's sat with them And Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh
