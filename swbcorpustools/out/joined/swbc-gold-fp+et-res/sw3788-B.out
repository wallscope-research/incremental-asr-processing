My voting experience personally I've been very diligent until recent years When I felt my vote was absolutely kind of washed down the drain For the issues you know that I felt really strong for I think apathy has set in to a lot of people because of the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run You really do have to study to get yourself up to par with what is truly going on and that takes a lot of research and people today are very busy and that is an excuse because we are always invo- I know I'm heavily involved in other things and to take time out and study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time and I don't have the time to devote to that and you hopefully find you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard And unfortunately they are not And it's really a dilemma that we find ourselves in I believe So I kind of just have taken a back step away and hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there Take it because it is a task that is to me kind of overwhelming Right they just want to see how close the electoral votes are with the public votes Yeah Yes Well I know that when you're in a smaller community I live in Mesquite and when we have a local election say for our mayor and so forth they really give a lot of information in the local newspaper not in the bigger city Dallas newspaper I mean they just give it a small portion of the newspaper but the local newspaper really goes into quite a bit of history about the candidate and then they raise two sides and there's a pro and a con side and you can really feel comfortable in evaluating that candidate by that method I feel pretty confident about the way it's put forth Now I wouldn't say that about the larger cities though and the country on like the presidential I mean they've got people that are running that are admitted criminals and admitted crooks You know I'm sorry but I don't believe in them turning a new leaf unless they have the Lord that has done that to them And without the Lord they can't do it
