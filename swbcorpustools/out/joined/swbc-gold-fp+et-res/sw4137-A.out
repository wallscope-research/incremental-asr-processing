Let's see mine's pretty easy actually I just got done reading or a couple magazine articles about the new Saturns and although I can't afford it right now I would just love to have one Well No regardless of that fact It's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money I'm interested in having it for doing a little autocross racing closed circuit racing and it seems to just blow the competition away Handling power everything Yeah it just got like the top rating It was compared up against let's see there was like the Mazda M X three Nissan's whatever their N X two thousand the Civic S I and it dominated over all of them all the raters loved it I like the styling and I seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it Mustang G Ts can't afford it Right yeah I'm a graduate student and let's face it I don't make any money so Yeah Yeah we'll see then Yeah right now I'm stuck I've got a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that it's fast but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing But it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the Saturn yeah I'd use it for both The nice thing about autocrossing is you can do both just like a set up a lot of times and it's like really large parking lots And pylons and things Tight turns hard acceleration I've seen a lot of Mustangs compete and it's interesting They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class Yeah what are you thinking about buying The Legend  Uh-huh Yeah Yeah well I was actually in a lot of the B M Ws are produced in Stutgardt and Munich and I was there this summer and I was really impressed by the factory tours and such for B M W Yeah  of course of course they are They want you to buy their car Yeah there it was interesting I also went to the Porsche and it was amazing how they were completely opposed Yeah the B M W is really like we have all these like high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and then you go to Porsche and it's like well these cars are completely handmade and no two of them are alike And so it's like completely opposed I don't know which do I like better I think I like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical Unless it's a toy Let's face it Yeah yeah but B M Ws good for that What kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to use it for Wow yeah That's cool Yeah that's good I was impressed by the Mercedes too I really like the Mercedes The factory was nice and And is it different for the B M W Probably Right I can imagine that
