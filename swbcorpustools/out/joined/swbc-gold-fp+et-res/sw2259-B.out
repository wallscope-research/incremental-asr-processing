At currently I think they are a little restrictive particularly for certain ethnic groups or from certain countries I think we should permit more immigration from eastern Europe for example particularly the Jewish people from Russia I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last several years And I think we have too much restriction on the Orientals also but of course that's just my opinion Uh-huh Uh-huh Well we seem to favor certain countries particularly South American countries And there is no I have nothing of course against the South Americans or Hispanics in that sense but I think we are more restrictive of the so called eastern European countries than we should be Of course that's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern Europe so so I think you know the embargo we placed on the Russian Jews although we spent years and years lobbying for their release and their ability to immigrate from Russia as soon as that occurred we simply said that instead of the hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by two thirds So I do not quite go along with that but No And I still think you know again kind of having within this century come from an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides Both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants so I'm a little touchy every now and then about that Uh-huh my Uh-huh Well I think in a way though I also have an opposite point of view which is although I believe we should permit you know constant immigration into this country primarily for economic reasons I think we should have some quotas of course my family and I again that was you know my grandparents came over during the time when there were quotas So they had to wait you know in certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over So you know but I think unrestricted immigration I think is not best Uh-huh Well you know there's another aspect of this too They're also diminishing the health restrictions which Well yes There were some regulations over I don't know whether they're laws passed or whatever they're called just recently where people with certain diseases cannot be excluded from immigration Age is one for example and recently tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country they dropped that also So I think in some ways we are becoming a little too egalitarian in that sense but I think we should be a little more circumspect about it Again my opinion Think we've talked long enough All right I have talked long enough Thank you Good-bye
