Well capital punishment is a hard thing but there's been several there have been several things that have happened where I felt like if I had been involved in it I would have had to go along with that being the punishment given to the people There have been some things you know there's things done that are just Yeah that I do not know how I do not really there's any other way to deal with it Yeah I think that that's a really Yeah if it's a clear and present danger I mean it But it's something that's really hard to deal with the way that our justice system is right now is basically set up in lawyers and anybody will tell you that it is set up right now all the laws protect the criminal They are the ones with the rights They have the right to you know I think I watched something last week I am sorry the accused has the right to a speedy trial But the victim does not have the same emphasis on those things as far as they are concerned so now the accused can ask for delays and extensions and what do they call whatever they call them you know Uh-huh uh-huh exactly Continuance They can get continuances on for years before the thing ever comes to trial and that makes the victim suffer more The Yeah that too  I think you know that there needs to be a way that you know once someone has gone through you know a trial I do not know how to fix it I mean it just seems like there should be a limit on how many appeals can be made You know when someone has been ha- Yeah when someone ha- Well even when someone has been convicted and I mean it's just so abundantly clear that they did it But appealing you know and continuing to appeal like four or five or six times To have convictions overturned and then they have to be retried and all that It's such a waste of time and energy and money And it just that's what keeps that's what is keeping all you know the criminals in a position of being able to be released all the time like this Oh Well I guess there's extenuating circumstances to anything like that you know like I could see a first time offender you know maybe in a robbery situation trying to hold up a store and getting scared and you know firing a gun and accidently killing someone Okay I could see that that might be the situation where the person could be rehabilitated But I think just out and out murder and I am talking about cutting people up you know where there's shown to be pathological tendencies where this person has done it over and over again in a serial fashion or whatever That those kinds of things and any kind of violent assault rape included needs to addressed in that context Well what bothers me that bothers me a great deal I had a friend who was a police officer who was killed in the line of duty And the thing that was the worst about it is that two of these individuals were well all of the individuals involved were very young One was technically a minor and so he was sent back to Mexico  Geez--this utt combined with B80 utt1 seem to total 4 legitimate slash units instead of just 1  he was an illegal alien the other two had lived here they had graduated from high school here See note above  and they had told their teachers that I mean repeatedly during high school they had told their teachers that they were going to graduate from high school and kill cops That was what they had told their teachers and so that's what they did And they were given I think absolutely He stopped them for routine traffic violation and they several things happened that night but they beat him up and took his gun and shot him with it And it was really terrible I mean I had seen him like three or days before that He we had gone out with he and his wife and that was really disturbing you know that that happened And these people you know in the course of the trial you know came up with all these you know things about well you know they were disadvantaged and all this stuff Well nobody is that disadvantaged And there's just no rea- I mean No Yeah I think so too And that's so I do feel strongly about Yeah Yeah Uh-huh The thing that even though juries sometimes make the decision and still the people nothing ever happens to them You know they stay in jail they get off time for good behavior and all that stuff and they get released And they go right back and do it again
