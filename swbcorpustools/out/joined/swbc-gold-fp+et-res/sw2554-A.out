Well what do you think about it No I don't either I don't think it's going to change very much but Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well you know the funny thing I find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the American public goes crazy And now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in Iraq they're going crazy You know I mean you can't please them one way or the other You know and I think that I agree with you this is exactly the right course I mean that's an internal problem to Iraq It has nothing to do with us And until he starts doing something so inhumane that the U N gets involved then it's nobody's business  All the time I mean yeah I mean Yeah Yeah and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years And it's going to continue As long as you have so many diverse groups that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time I mean the Kurds have tried it before They've gotten their butts kicked and this is just another time that it's happening You know they'll regroup out in the mountains and they'll try it again in a couple of years Sure and I don't have any doubt that through some back channels we encouraged it You know But I'm not real sure that we promised them anything I that would have been stupid and I don't think we did it Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right I don't think they would have done that But it really doesn't make any difference This is just another chapter in Middle Eastern history sure I mean the British occupied the place the French occupied it we've done it it's happened so many times this is really nothing special That's right it's mostly religious anyway Yeah Yeah exactly Well I think one of the big problems I mean looking at it from the American public's standpoints they don't understand the Middle Easterners They don't understand what I mean their politics really isn't politics It's religion couched as politics And there's a big difference You know we sit there and we think that they think the way we think And that's a big mistake because they don't Uh-huh Yeah Yeah that's it a lot of the time I was stationed in Turkey for a year and a half And it was tough understanding those folks You know they're so completely different culturally and socially and religiously it was very strange It was very interesting Now I shoot I think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't have a clue sometimes You know they sit there and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert Well I'm not real sure that's appropriate No Well I sort that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country too And we make experts by reading books You know and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing Yeah Yeah I guess you work for T I So you guys are well aware of the problems with the Japanese markets and everything else Yeah it's like our car industry the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the Japanese you know came into it and helped us out Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah and until we start changing our educational system I mean we're going to be we've already been overtaken but it's going to get even worse later I mean looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the the math and the science and everything It's not us You know we've got folks running around here who get degrees in basket weaving and you know underwater psychology or some ridiculous stuff like that and where are the engineers coming from Yeah exactly my roommate is a he's getting his doctorate in industrial well it's not industrial engineering it's human factors His degree was in industrial engineering and he's from the Philippines And the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it He has no intention of going back to the Philippines because there's no jobs You know but I see it all too often I mean we've got loads of foreign students and they're coming here going after the hard degrees and then they're going back to Korea and Japan and Hong Kong and everywhere else and they're applying it there And I don't know to me it's amazing I don't know what we're going to do as a country we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later Uh-huh Yeah you I don't think there can be anymore long range planning I think it's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike You know here's a crisis Well let's plug it up I don't know I don't know what the answer is It's far beyond me Yeah all we can do is keep plugging You know I wonder I read in the paper just last week I B M's unveiling their new laptop computer Well at a price tag of six thousand bucks I don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers Be- now I have the I B M P S two but I'm sorry I got it It's slow there are many better machines on the market right now for a the only reason I got it is because I got it through an educational purchase plan through the school and I saved forty-eight percent so I said yeah if I can have an I B M for forty-eight percent discount I'll take it But up to that point I had always said I would never have one because I wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name But now you watch just sure as anything the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it Uh-huh It's already outdated Yeah Yeah yeah I can imagine years ago I remember when I had a T I ninety-nine Put all the money into the expansion box and all this that and the other and things just kept changing so much and I kept getting rid of them and I finally said well you can't do this You've got to buy something and stick with it so I just at an opportune time I got one that suited my needs and I've just stuck with it The only thing I've done to it is just add a mouse and a hard drive And that's all I plan to do Of course I'm limited on memory now because I've got the low line I got the model twenty-five So I'm stuck with six forty but I'm not a power user so it doesn't matter Yeah Yeah now my roomie on the other hand he is a power user he's looking now to get rid of his He's got a three eighty-six and wants to get a four eighty-six You know this kind of stuff
