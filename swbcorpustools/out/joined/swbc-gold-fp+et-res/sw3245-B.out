Okay I'm ready Uh-huh No I work at home Do you have children that's good I have four girls they're nine and five and three and a newborn Yes Girls are nice aren't they Anyway as far as clothing goes my wardrobe changes all the time depending on my size We go from regular kind of spring clothes regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes clothes that are in between where you're not down to regular size yet or you're on your way up from regular size and they're all in boxes or bags and they all rotate all the time kind of the same stuff all the time though I don't get a whole lot new right now Yeah Yeah I like jeans a lot and it's frustrating I find I have to get the right kinds though or it's not comfortable they it works best if they have pleats in the front and they have to my waist is kind of small compared to the hips so it has to be not the straight up and down levis kind but I when I was pregnant through the summer this time I wore dresses all the time because it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist but Yeah yeah Uh-huh Yeah yeah I haven't tried those Huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh I don't know if they expected us to talk about blazers and such here but I sure never wear them Yeah Uh-huh I'm watching Janice uh-huh Oh I remember that from when I was I worked way before I was married even but offices they keep them so cold in the summer that you can't wear regular summer clothes and be comfortable you've got to have something to add to it or something I don't know if you can You burn up Yeah Yeah It's hard on the car Oh Yeah that's funny Yeah at least something cooler That's true Yeah I don't have to worry a whole lot about that That's right something that it doesn't matter if it gets spit up on too I've always been a creature of comfort too if it's not comfortable forget it Wool was never comfortable to me
