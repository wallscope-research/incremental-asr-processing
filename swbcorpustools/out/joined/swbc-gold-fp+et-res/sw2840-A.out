Do you have any particular thoughts about the school system I agree with you a hundred percent there Yeah Yeah Yeah it's interesting because we're just having conversation on this with a couple of people yesterday And I was expressing my frustrations that so many problems I work in a high school are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home and it's seen more so because when you call parents up many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say well my kid I've never heard anything about this before This is the first time there have been problems and you wonder don't these parents know that teachers talk and you know we do check with other teachers and other teachers find the same things in this child And you know how do you tell the parent hey wake up and smell the coffee But it is a problem and I'm not sure just how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it Whether maybe through a commitment of the P T A and the parents being informed better that in fact that the problems that are nationwide are problems of society and that the school can only do so much on it Uh-huh Yeah yeah That's right Uh-huh <> You know what scares me too is that we have yet to see the biggest effect of the crack children in the school system These are children that are born with low attention deficit and gosh what's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system That's really scary <> But I think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve and this is something that I see Too many times students get diagnosed as slow learners and in fact they're not They're behavior problems And so they get put in our school system in a class that's limited for skills children that really have to master skills And that's not their problem at the same time I've seen we have an international population There's no bridge area for students coming out of the E S O L which is English for Speakers of Other Languages program The once they're past E S O L they get out they got thrown right into the total mainstream and there really needs to be a bridge some sort of transition for that So the school systems can improve both in standing up for splitting classes you know having slow children in slow classes but not mixing them with behavior problems And then you know the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated And then you throw in kids that are not motivated maybe bright but they're discipline problems And you sometimes the average classes really are problems because you've got such a mixed bag there You know the gifted and talented are fast classes There's really not that much of a problem with But it's Uh-huh That's yeah I remember I had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I guess kids do mature at different ages too That's and you know as a teacher you try to be understanding that you know there are different ages kids are is this a got a kid that just a question of maturity or is he a problem child But teachers are asked to diagnose so much I mean we're have to be we're alerted there's all sorts of systems where suicide predisposition I mean we're alerted to what the moment we see something If we see a child that's on drugs such as if he's got a beeper or if they're if they're flashing lots of money around there are certain things to do I mean so the school system's asked to do so much but you can't operate in a vacuum we're in a rather wealthy suburb of Washington And a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the principal It's for drug use They can't imagine for anything else Yeah You know it's amazing but you get all sorts of things in the schools and it's and you know as a teacher you're alert for the kid who's very drowsy You're alert to the kid who suddenly has a behavioral change and you refer them to the nurse And so I mean you have to find out whether there's a legitimate reason or whether this is a warning signal And parents frequently resent when you ask them Is there a problem that we should be aware of 2 utts Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah the denial mechanism is really strong and so many parents are facilitators I mean they're manipulated by their children I've been fortunate I have a son who's a sophomore in college up in Massachusetts at Amherst and my other son is a senior in high school and he's going on to Williams And I mean they're really super They're both national level swimmers and we've been very fortunate but you know they had to be held accountable too I mean you know at some point a parent does help their kid in some ways but you have to say at what point isn't the help becoming negative And I think this is where the school system is suffering and not through any fault of the effort of the school system But gee it was good talking with you Yeah so there are people throughout the country that feel the same ways that you do and are connected with the schools Uh-huh Well we are though Listen good luck Take care Bye-bye
