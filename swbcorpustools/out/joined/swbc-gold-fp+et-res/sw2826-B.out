I grew up in well at that time I was in a Trenton New Jersey so and it was a suburb of Trenton so I really had mixture of suburb and urban living Yeah I think you're right It's interesting I work in a high school So I'm comparing my life when I was in high school thirty years ago to what I see these children doing And the pressures on the children you know you hear this as an excuse but it's true they are so much greater I cannot believe what they're doing academically the demands on them and I can see why children do drop out I can see the you know Uh-huh uh-huh And you didn't have to lock your door And a lo- some of these are urban worries but it's a lot different all though I guess twenty years a go now in this area things were similar because twenty years ago let's see it was after yeah to twenty-five years ago is when we had the Washington riots the first rights we've been having some problem now and it reminded me of that Uh-huh Whereabouts Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh well the Washington riots weren't because The Washington riots weren't because I lived right downtown Washington and what you saw was what you got I'm telling you Yeah but you know it is interesting they're so many mor- they're different kind of dangers that face young people now and social pressures the pressures of drug is so much the prevalence is so much greater the kinds of diseases that you've got out the I mean the consequences is so much of what's going on is so much more serious then when we were younger Uh-huh uh-huh Yes and Uh-huh That's true I also being involved in the school system see so many of the problem children coming from their parents children who will lie and cheat and you approach their parents and their parents are constantly justify them rather then to you know they're constantly excusing their child and you can see exactly why the child is that way You as a teacher can't hold a child accountable if you're not going to get reinforced by that at home And you can't make up in a classroom of one hour a day what's not been done for fifteen or sixteen years at home and you get mixed signals so it's not always the school's systems I think a lot of it is the families the way you were mentioning yeah No Of course life is a lot more complicated too in ways the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained for now you know with farming being so mechanized people working on the family farm which was a traditional American way that becomes less and less likely factory jobs are so much more sophisticated And the kinds of knowledge that you know it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force and some people just don't have it And you worry when you know the sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children in terms of what it's going to mean to a society in the future it's a some ways it's rather frightening It certainly is Well it sure is It sure is It was a little easier though wasn't it Yes Yeah And all the things demanded of the mother too I mean I look at my mother's life I mean she didn't work for a long time when I was very young she didn't drive she learned to drive I think when I was a teenager and her life was a lot simpler and I sit here That's right That's right that's right They need you more as a teenager Isn't that true That's why I'm working in a school system so that I'm home when they're home  That's exac- isn't that that's so true I find working in a high school is very helpful because it let's me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do and it keeps me from being the old fogy so but at the same time it also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes as to what's com- but that's the same I'm home in the summers I'm home with the holidays I'm home at three o clock when the children are at home or where home one is now a senior in high school and the other's in college and it does Uh-huh uh-huh That's right Well I that is so true and it's not that the children always say something but every once in awhile they'll come up and make a comment and you realize it's important that and yet you know we have to make that choice I think twenty thirty years ago a lot of women just didn't have to make that choice Well I Linda Lee Uh-huh And your name was Well I enjoyed talking with you Well I enjoyed talking with you Okay Bye-bye
