Well I am new to Texas so I don't even know what the law is in the state do you that's right I think now that I recall reading about it in the paper you know different things is it restricted to certain crimes Or just Uh-huh Well Yes I know the one thing that I think is really sad about it as I recall from the articles that I've read is that if people who have been there are going to be killed there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent and they want I mean they're anxious for someone to be killed I just I can't see that Uh-huh No Well there is so many chances for appeal that it kee- Ye- it's really sad I don't know I just think somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than expecting the feeling that it with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know Is really kind of bad That's true and there really are criminals that are hard-core and repeat and never have any chance for I don't know is it do you feel at all like it's a religious issue Uh-huh  I don't know sometimes I feel I mean I do go to church and things I don't know how I would feel about it But like you say if it hit you personally closer at home you would feel differently Do you think most states have that or Uh-huh That still does it that's right Uh-huh Have that Well and it doesn't seem like very many people are really I mean there's a lot of people that are on death row But there's not very many people that actually do get killed Uh-huh So it seems like a of people live there and then through appeals Because I know they do frequently I mean they cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper If it finally gets to that point Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh So is it are we doing lethal injection now Uh-huh which seems so awful So it's a little bit more humane I guess it is Yes the other one just seems so terrible  Well do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison Uh-huh  Yes Well and I notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area It's kind of been scary to think about it And you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that You hate to have the dubious honor of being you know so high in statistics But I you know we have been really fortunate our family hasn't had any crime And so we don't it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way And how they would expect how they would hope I mean you hear of people who have committed crimes and then they get out of jail and they go and they do the same thing again And you wonder why they can't just stop it So maybe you would but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone No I know when we moved here I got a jury summons just like constantly it seemed like but fortunately I had small children and I didn't have to go And it's not that I mean I think everyone should have to serve on the jury it's just that I didn't I hate having to be in charge of someone else's life And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case involving a violent crime or anything That would be really awful Well anyway I sure have enjoyed talking to you about this Although it has been difficult but I'd hate to decide it but I guess it's important that we decide as a people what we're going to do Anyway well you have a good day Thank you bye-bye
