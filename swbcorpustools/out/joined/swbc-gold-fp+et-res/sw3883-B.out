Well you know it depends upon our weather here You know today was a beautiful day it was like summer day It was seventy degrees so I dressed in a light weight skirt it's a ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater cardigan over it Because I had some appointments at the office today some interviews and so I had to dress up anyway and then I wore heels you know But when it rains a lot which is has been doing here a lot lately very often you know wear pants and boots you know So how do you dress Okay Uh-huh Yeah I can see I've been a teacher so has my daughter and I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that it was tiring That's right That's right and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids right Yeah I do too So to be taller than some of the boys in the older grades I had to wear heels Uh-huh Of course we wear an unlined boots you know it has a heel on it They're the kind of boots that I wear to work and we wear them you know they're a leather boot that you wear and as I said they have a regular heel on them high heel And we wear them a lot with shirts and things it's kind of a I can't say constant down here in Texas that you wear these boots They're not a cowboy boot but they're just a real pretty boot but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain As I have a private high school that I run here when I'm interviewing a parent of course I feel like I need to wear heels you know and look like I'm a business person You know because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle if you wear boots too often you know Of course you probably wear coats a lot my goodness so then you had to Yes Then things improved right But of course here we wear a light weight jacket a lot you know you know and that's very seldom it depends upon our winter We have a few days you might wear a winter coat you know but most of the time you can wear a sweater and we just don't wear coats much We often laugh about even when it turns chilly We're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that It's really different Let's put it that way Are you not teaching anymore I see so you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet Yeah uh-huh More practical When you were teaching did you ever have a blue jean day or anything like that Yeah well I know that some of the schools they have country western day or something like that one you know or tacky day and I always thought it got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too It's all right for the students they look tacky a lot but I didn't think teachers should you know Yeah Do you like Iowa Where did you live before well that's quite a change from California to Utah
