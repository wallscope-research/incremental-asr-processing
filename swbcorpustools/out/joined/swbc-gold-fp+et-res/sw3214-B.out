Okay my name is Terry Okay yes there's COUNTRY LIVING there's COUNTRY and yeah Sure that's great Well I actually take COUNTRY LIVING it's a country magazine on HOUSE BEAUTIFUL because I like that kind of stuff Decorating and getting ideas for a garden In fact right before you called I was planning my tulips and putting them on blue print on where I'm going to put them so I'm really into that but so I really get into magazines that are kind of basically into housing type things be decorating and gardening and recipes that kind of stuff So I'm pretty much in the same category as what you're looking at Uh-huh Sure Yeah Yeah yeah I've had TIME before I think with that what happens is it's interesting to read but you kind of just put the magazine away and you never read it again unless there's some big article in there that you're going to keep for your kids but Yeah it sounds exactly like what we did we just saved everything we could for our daughter but that's pretty similar but I find that with these COUNTRY magazines I keep going back to them getting ideas looking back and saying Jeez there was a flower garden in there that I would like to have some ideas you know I get a lot of ideas from them Yes we do We're out in the country we're right across from a river and you're right the leaves are beautiful and they are falling now so it just peaked last week and it was just gorgeous out here but Yeah it's beautiful The other thing about magazines the only thing I don't like is they really get heavily into advertising and you know it's fine I'd rather almost have I know that part probably half their money comes from these people that are saying Put my ad in your paper and I'll pay you or whatever but there's been some magazines I've looked at and it's a real turn off to see every other page some kind of ad Yeah VOGUE is heavily into that Yeah exactly it's almost I mean you could go into a store and get bombarded the same way but Uh-huh Yeah exactly Exactly yeah they're really getting into that so But pretty much like I said the magazines I've had BETTER HOMES AND GARDEN and now I need a switch and I'm going back to GOURMET COOKING because I've had the magazine before back in nineteen eighty-six and I thought Well I'll give it a try again because you get tired of one magazine and you need to try a change yes I do and most of the time I tear them out A lot of times you know if I got a chance to sit down at my typewriter I'll go ahead and type out recipes but what I usually do is I'll try it out in the magazine first and without tearing it out and then give it a Yeah and then if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection but Yeah Uh-huh Sure sure Uh-huh Yeah that's what I just went through we just recently moved from Minnesota to Wisconsin I went through all this I had this huge stack of HOUSE BEAUTIFUL I had COLONIAL TIMES I had GOURMET yeah It was hard but I ended up reducing them down to like fifteen magazines out of hundreds And I just said Okay there's one picture in there that it really doesn't you know it's got to have more than that it's got to have some good ideas it's got to have everything So I just kind of went through and I find that most of the magazines I really like is around Christmas time because
