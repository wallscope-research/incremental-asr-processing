Hi Uh-huh Any particular reason Uh-huh <> Uh-huh I really don't I like to refer to this as sort of CONSUMER REPORT phenomenon Which is everybody that I know reads CONSUMER REPORTS so the people who do feel that CONSUMER REPORTS does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest But assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas without thinking that there were people who think each other area of specialty and I guess you could explain it two ways and the cynical view is well these things aren't doing a very good job at all And the view that I would rather take is that there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or particularly interested in buying something you know as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things And I think the same thing is true with news If you want to just have an idea as to what's going on most papers and especially the better papers the TIMES the WALL STREET JOURNAL the WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea If you were deeply involved in it then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know that much Well I mean there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things And most people think it is and I can you know accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it I don't think it's that high I know a lot of people who may watch the T V news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper And I think they're saying well if something's really important I'll at least find out that it happened and that's is a reasonable start and for awhile I didn't read a newspaper when I came out here because I didn't find one that I liked and if something important happened it was covered on T V and I could then go and pick up newspapers if it were important enough to read about And I imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened you'd find out from friends or other channels Clarence Thomas or Right Uh-huh Yeah I stayed as far away from those as I could I decided I didn't want to waste the time I had I guess five years ago now wasted that kind of time with Oliver North hearings And afterwards decided that what I had gotten out of it just wasn't worth the time I put in And that these things are just very slow in seeing information come out
