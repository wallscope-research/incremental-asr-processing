Is kind of fun It's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now And I grew up in an area that was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal I worked for a camp for a number of years My father was on staff there and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats speedboats you name it they had it and we did a lot of water sports But I think the thing I liked the best was we spent about a summer couple of guys restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it If you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it upright again This one you had to work with You get out of the water again and get it upright And sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind as it were tacking back and forth and more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over it was calm So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle Seems that a new slash unit should start with "So "  and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away And that didn't always work We oftentimes got wet But it's a nice hobby to have Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore so things change I guess What are your memories of boating or current Right That's true Yeah I remember learning how to ski I guess I was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres and it had a lot of turtles in it And I got all ready to go and I was down in the water and set to go and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back It didn't hurt too much but it bit enough to where I let go And the boat went off without me and I reached back there and pushed him away and got out of the water a while and it didn't even leave a mark It was just a little nibble and so I told everybody what happened and they go yeah sure you know And so I get back down in there and I'll be if he didn't do it again This time a little earlier I had let go before then and before they took off this time and swatted him away So I moved over a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and managed to get up Didn't go very far but I got up And it was a nice long skiing career but now I've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me I've done about all I dare do on skis You know skiing on one and jumping around here and there and I know how you can get injured doing much more than that and I just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that Just can't take the risk I did as a dumb teenager I guess So life just changes a little bit in that respect I'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that doesn't have a well what they call trick skis They'll allow you to ski backwards I haven't managed to get a hold on that craft yet but Yeah it would be kind of nice I hadn't quite figured out I don't have anybody to teach me either That's another little thing You need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what I've seen you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick you know Grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around But I don't know maybe someday I'll get back to that after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end weekend or something
