So Have you heard about Saturns that's great Actually that's kind of the type of car that I'm thinking about we might get Saturns you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a Saturn dealer this offshoot of G M And supposedly they've got great customer satisfaction from what things I've heard Well like what Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I've got a sixty-five Mustang and I do most of the work on that myself And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that I just say I will never do that with the modern cars It's not worth my time You can't get in there You can't do anything And it's so complicated too I look at it and I say boy you know I'd have to almost go take a class or something like that Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah That's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about Actually one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Ninety yeah Or excuse me the ninety-twos The ninety-twos had dual air bags This newest model You could get them with duals Yeah But the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars Actually my wife and I are actually contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so So we're actually been looking around and thinking about things We'd like to get like a I don't know What do you call it A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know Year old ninety-two or something like that See if we And the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns too Because they looked really nice Well the Saturns you can get air bags in them I don't think you can get dual side air bags But one of the two things that I'm really I'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart That doesn't have problems You set down You look at consumer reports We've been pouring over consumer reports and you just get so depressed for the U S auto makers when you do that Because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have and the two cars that apparently are close to that That actually have high reliability the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars And the other one are the Saturns So those two things And then you know we kind of want a four door
