Yeah {F Uh } I don't either I've never I don't work at home right now I stay home with my children but my husband works and they do have that at his place of employment and neither of us have a problem with it We've particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and such it's a scary thing to know that you just don't know what people are doing before they go to work So and the advertisements on television lately have been so there have been so many You know there's just about like train wrecks and things like that I feel like probably just for our own safety when we're traveling and things that would be something I'd like to know that's going on  Right Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Well it's unfortunate I think that everyone doesn't have that opinion I've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that but in the long run it seems to me it's kind of like what they keep talking about the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that you know they feel that's not fair and whatever but you know those kind of things I'd like to know myself It wouldn't be in my opinion I've had a lot of dental work done and the last dentist didn't even use gloves at all so that kind of yeah so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me Well you would think so That is because well and I worked for a dentist and that's you know you come in contact with a lot of blood and things like that and it's real real dangerous I would think but with all the accidents just with everything happening with just airlines just drive me crazy People are afraid to fly now You know just because they don't know what their pilot's been doing and things like that and I don't know Uh-huh Well and you know if they do find someone who is having a problem with drugs and they can get them the help that they need As opposed to just letting the problem go on without any support And whatever because a lot of people seems like obviously are trying to hide that from their employer and friends and family and things and too many people are just dying Particularly in our area I don't know what the crime is like where you are but the crime rate here is just astronomical Uh-huh I just got a piece of paper the other day that now they have these I have two very little children under two and I got a piece of paper from my husband's office it's talking about these drug tattoos now that they have got it looks like a sticker and it's for kid
