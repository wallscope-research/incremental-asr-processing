yes I'm an old experienced hand I started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all My daughter that's seventeen now I worked even when she was a baby And I had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then I was really lucky to have put them in a Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist right off of Walnut Hill and Preston And it was a wonderful environment I just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place So it worked well How about you Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh It's not hard to find anything that's part-time So many of the churches have really strong preschool and children's day out but it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little and this is one of the few churches that did it There were a couple downtown Dallas but they seemed cold and impersonal I just couldn't hack it And what I liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there when Cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today So there was real continuity She went back as a teenager and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there So it was really neat But it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good people and real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts and I'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that That if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff Uh-huh Or pay for it after school Our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art and you know I willingly did it but I thought this makes me angry This is something that ought to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff they do Yeah Yeah well that's the only way they're going to be able to do it And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that So in some ways I think the day schools do serve those purposes Yeah Yeah Put the colors away Which is too bad Uh-huh Uh-huh Until they were two Yeah Yeah both times they were at our house And that was hard too I lucked out with really good people both times but I know so many people that are never able to find that and I'd practically give my paycheck away to do it so Yeah Well no she didn't live with us the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a daughter through nursing school just purely on baby-sitting money And she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night And she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead So that was a plus from that respect as well And then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her So I just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that would be hard Well they give a lot more leave I work at N C N B now and our benefits for maternal and parental care and even for elderly people are really expanding We have more options now then we did when my kids were born with being able to take off full-time longer you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time for up to six months It's really neat I've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or they've you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint We try to work it with their hours And that helps because you don't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say okay I never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again And the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals I've of course it's too late for me so I've not tried them to see how effective they are but I think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast And for <> our age group it's too late too little too late But I do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work Two income families I think are here to stay Uh-huh Right Yeah Oh sure You retain employees and keep them longer that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces So I hope it helps It seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time because that's hard Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well in Plano though the problem is you find and this is what I found with Emily from the time she started first grade I wanted her out in Plano area And I kept finding neighbors and friends and they'd move She ended up being in a different home every year And I finally decided I didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move So this year I tried Kinder-Care and then she's old enough to <>
