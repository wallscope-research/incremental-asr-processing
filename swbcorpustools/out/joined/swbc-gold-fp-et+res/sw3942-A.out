Well the topic's about government I'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I I + I  think that the last part of that question was particularly interesting about can all unethical behavior how much unethical behavior can be made illegal because i- it seems to me that when government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical codes parallel to the legal codes that we're focusing on the wrong thing Maybe maybe that's what is happening Maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past you know ten to twenty years that it becomes more evident Perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or you know et cetera like that and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons And I couldn't help thinking when that last quest- it was a funny question when that last part of the question came about h- how many things can we actually put a legal code on that how much should it be our prerogative to see into the private lives of these people You know  That's right Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh I I + I  agree with that and and also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's you know going to the public then then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience And you kn- when it becomes public though it becomes scandalous The that's + that's  the thing that things that you don't know d- do + do  not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray People could say they do it so I guess you know but as soon as things do get public there there is that terrible concern So sometimes I ask myself what are people doing that are in the media when somebody you know comes up to office it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines It's a very low way of living so a- and + and  + and  as far as you know myself having any particular personal knowledge or insight into politics or politicians it I'm not terribly involved in it Just in a very cursory way I vote and I you know try to do whatever I can on the little local area but I I + i-  + it  just is not one of the things that I have placed a a lot of my particular time and effort into so I I always feel very outside this kind of this kind of an issue But Yeah Uh-huh Yeah right Yeah  uh-huh I'm not I'm not in there I'm not one of those you know volunteers that's down at headquarters and whatever although I admire the people that do that and they certainly do get inside information and of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing the more you can trust their their judgment and their insight But the media insight as you said I just kind of read and kind of be aware and then I don't like to make a whole lot of judgment m- myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that
