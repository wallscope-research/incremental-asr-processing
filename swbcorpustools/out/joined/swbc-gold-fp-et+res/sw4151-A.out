Do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore Uh-huh Of the statements made by people against the the death penalty I I like the statement made by Cuomo Cuomo I believe is he's he's governor of New York but he's against the death penalty But he said that he would he would want to to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if if they did something to his wife And that's but but even even in that circumstan- in that situation he would b- he would hope that there would be people around him who would keep him from doing the doing the things Right exactly Uh-huh Yeah See I don't think the decisions that are going to be made on dea- on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do Are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who can't survive or or that that aren't conforming enough to society so that that we work well together Or are they is it a penal institution Is it is is it designed for punishment the death penalty surely fits in well with in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment perhaps not in the manner that we do it but but it in in theory it fits in In reforma- system in a reformatory if you if you put someone to death you obviously can't reform them So Yeah I don't think it's done I don't think we run it as a deterrent people say that but if it was really a deterrent I think like horse thieves in the old west you know they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while And if we really w- if it was really seriously going to be a d- deterrent I would think that it would be public I don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever sees it If someone ever if you know like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime had to sit and watch and and see a guy burn or or you know something or shot by a firing squad or something like that I would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than you know telling them that there's there's protestors out here at the you know
