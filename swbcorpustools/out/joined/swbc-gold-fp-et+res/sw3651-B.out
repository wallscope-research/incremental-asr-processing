What kind of woodworking do you do Uh-huh well I like to think of it as a hobby but I I guess also partly out of necessity Just repairing things around the house a few years ago we needed they needed some book shelves and I kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves and it actually worked pretty well and over the years I've I've refined those plans I got myself a router and I'm I'm very good at making book shelves It's it's also a way of relieving stress My wife kind of laughs at me that anytime I get stressed out I just go out in the garage and we've got more book shelves well yeah little by little I I started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things gotten a a good belt sander and and the router helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router The latest project that I've been working on {A and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months } is a a cabinet to to put a T V in Right And it that's works well because you can design it to to suit whatever equipment you have so I designed a space just the right size for the T V and then the the V C R and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment And that's worked pretty well with with the router you can make nice I guess dado joints is what it's called And it's That's right That's right So But what I need next is a good table saw And I I debate whether it's better to get a just a straight table saw or to get one of these rotary arm saws Radial arm saw is I guess what they're called it t- seems to me the radial arm saw is is better well it it takes up less room you you set the wood down and you move the saw Whereas if you're ripping wood you're probably better off with a a table saw Yeah that that's partly my problem now I don't have room for this I I where where we lived before up north basements were were common and I used to put all the stuff in my basement but not so here in Texas Yeah Uh-huh Have you ever used a lathe
