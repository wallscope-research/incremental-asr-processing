So how do you feel about it Yeah I I myself almost am in favor of it I work at Honeywell and I went through a a pretty I don't know I went through a standard drug testing thing before I I was brought on I think that's pretty standard At least at Honeywell it is I think it's important to insure the quality and and I don't know almost the goodness of character You know that kind of thing Where do you work okay okay  great Right Uh-huh Yeah Yeah And that that definitely happens you know those the drug tests sure they're accurate but there's always that margin of error And that's that's something to be aware of Another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate They aren't that sensitive Like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they going to do about that You know I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested for Honeywell and you know I know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something I'm sure they screen for just a particular few types Although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for I don't know What what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon okay Great yeah I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida University of Central Florida And this is actually a an internship up here But they even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing so Right they essentially no I sure don't <> <> they essentially they essentially made me the offer and then and then did the drug testing thing after that So it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests and and then they essentially give you the offer and then at that point they'll they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that So there's some noise on this end I'm actually in a mall calling so You probably wondered But Yes That's a good question I believe from what I remember of the literature they gave if you fail I believe they give you one more chance They probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it But you know once again those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know But wha- are you working right now anywhere or Okay okay Great Yeah That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know Was was going to Honeywell A friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there And he's doing an internship with I B M And they basically did the same exact thing we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug testing <> at the same time So one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process But No no That's one thing they don't do is is drug testing while you're on the job I think I think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it but they don't do it You know so That's good I guess I don't know I I have gone to a couple of parties since since that time and while I don't do any drugs myself I've seen some people who work there you know smoking a joint or whatever And you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up you know But no they don't they don't really do that So Yeah
