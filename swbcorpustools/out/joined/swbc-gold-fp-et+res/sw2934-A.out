Well the last three days it's been pretty rainy We went to the beach and it started let's see around four o'clock and it had thunder and lightning it was and then you know it was just overcast and rainy for the next two or three days straight How about yours Uh-huh You're from Virginia from Texas I heard they had some flooding down there Uh-huh  Uh-huh Well the last couple of years we're we're over as far as our rainfall goes Before that it was really dry and everybody was you know talking about rationing water and doing this and doing that Not really rationing water but just cutting down And it seems like you know the weather pattern is just shifting and that jet stream is moving into our area North Carolina and across but it's changing latitude yeah Uh-huh It's finally cleared up It's just now st- still a little overcast but the s- but the sun has finally started popping out yeah well right now as a matter of fact I'm fixing to go play tennis It's I'd say it's at least seventy-nine eighty well about seventy-eight seventy-nine degrees actually the the wind normally blows let's see let me think about this south southwest Yeah but a- but actually our I guess our weather pattern comes from the blows north east yeah you're right it blows north east Uh-huh Uh-huh How f- how far are you from Houston I see so you so you don't hav- you don't get anything off the Gulf immediately from from the ocean Uh-huh Well we've had some you know pretty pretty rough winds Bangle- Bangladesh boy they they caught it bad But we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes I know Hurricane Hugo you probably heard about that last year Yeah and they're still rebuilding from that storm and so the the beaches here just get really beat up <> and it usually comes this way It comes up from Miami down around you know around the Bahamas and it usually travels northwest and it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits let's see two years ago we had one as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house And it was real odd The m- barometric pressure drops during a tornado and our fire alarm went off So of course that woke everybody up and we knew what was going on to you know go downstairs or go into the bedro- bathroom and take cover But we get yeah we're we're we get our share of tornados No huh-uh We're about two hours from the beach So you know it's barometric pressure I believe is higher in the mountains and we cat- we catch some winds you know a few winds coming off of them I think But let's see you all just had a tornado over close to Oklahoma and Texas Uh-huh gosh did it  Boy I would have like to have heard that That cou- would have been something Uh-huh Uh-huh I used to live in Amarillo originally So I'm Oh yeah We used to sit out especially in Borger we use to sit out on our back picnic table and watch them come out of the sky through the funnel clouds and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground But otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them go in and out of those clouds Yeah Yeah Yeah you'd be amazed at how clear the sky was but the clouds are just really rolling kind of just real pillowy I guess well I was in that big tornado went through Wichita Falls And the sky we were right in the middle of it when signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us And a whole roof of a restaurant came off And it was a eerie a real eerie blue-green color And the lightning was almost continuous just you know as if you put your hand on one of those electric things that causes lightning I think it was called the storm But the s- the whole sky was full of that eerie blue-green lightning  Uh-huh We haven't got that much rain but when it rains it's it's been downpouring You too Okay thanks Bye
