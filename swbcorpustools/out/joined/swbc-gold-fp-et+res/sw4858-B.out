Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I'm I I was just in high school I guess when it when it ended Ended up being I was in the last last lottery And I was glad it was over by then I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there Just because you know we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like You know we those people that I know I work with several that were over there and for some of them it was just kind of I don't know not so much a holiday I guess that's how they tend to talk about it But that they just kind of lived out in the woods and ever now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles and then they'd come back and you know But that they weren't really allowed to do anything I to me it seems like we only went halfway If even halfway slash error Uh-huh slash error should be 'b' Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh slash error Uh-huh slash error should be 'b' Yeah Well I I I think we did I think we did learn some lessons that we weren't we weren't prepared for I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war the other wars seemed like a valiant war they seemed like a valiant thing You knew you knew who was good You knew who was bad And it was a it was a traditional m- the traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you you know whichever way it is But in in the Vietnam war it seems like it was a a the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to whose good and whose bad and and you know the even it seems like even the people you know had the South Vietnamese the North Vietnamese and of course the Laotians and the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved But Yeah Yeah Yeah
