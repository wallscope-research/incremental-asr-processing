Yes yes I'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts And I camp every month camp at least one weekend and during the summer we camp two or three weeks a year I'd say I camp quite a bit Well we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping and we we also carry all our equipment with us and so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again How about yourself Well that's good Uh-huh Great What what kind of camping do they like best Do they like it where they have tents and do they cook on stoves Uh-huh Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah It doesn't get very cold in Texas so lots of times we don't even take tents We just use trail tarps it's just a piece of material that has that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent like a they're very light weight and we use them when we go backpacking So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then they're not very heavy see so you carry them with you and they'll keep you dry or whatever Uh-huh Ye- yes in fact last month we went camping we saw a lot of deer in the morning and the afternoon just deer everywhere Uh-huh so but it even though it wasn't hunting season and we were with Boy Scouts so of course we don't want to go hunting But we got to see a lot of deer out and about and there's of course we see smaller animals all the time and one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night is make sure that all the food's put away and so forth because we have armadillos Do you know what armadillo is Uh-huh And possums and raccoons And we have those creatures down here that they like to they like to go hunting for a midnight snack And so that that that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away They will if you attack them But most time they run away from you if they if they see you're up you know but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep So
