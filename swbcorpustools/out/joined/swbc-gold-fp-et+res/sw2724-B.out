so what do you do to exercise Uh-huh  That's pretty impressive I guess I bicycle the amount varies as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week I guess a play softball one night a week And I backpack a lot over the summer Yeah that's that's about the extent of it I don't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise But I guess the bicycling is the one thing I'll sort of like do if I feel like I need to go exercise but I do it mostly for fun It it it varies out near my house is pretty hilly but sometimes I bike to work which is about a fifteen mile trip each way And that's mostly flat about forty-five fifty minutes Yeah it can be a pain basically I work on a campus so I can store my bike in my office and walk across the campus to the gym use the shower there but it's it's enough of a pain that I did it consistently one year I would commute every day but it just became such a pain we're talking you know forty-five fifty minutes for biking and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind And then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff It was a big hunk hunk of the day and then of course another hour to get back home so I've been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when I get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends Not so much I guess mostly I bike on my own I've got a touring bike though I haven't gone on any extended trips with it How about you what kind of biking do you do Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh  Uh-huh I see Uh-huh It's good to have a partner Are you think of doing any like centuries or Uh-huh Yeah I just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like you know touring like from Vermont or you know that kind of thing I mean people seem to get into different aspects One is more of a distance and one's more just you know they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah yeah that's nice  Wow Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I'm not sure why that is generally in the Midwest it seems to be less much less maybe it's because of the winters or maybe just because you know there's there's a lot more flat lands you know out in the West So it makes biking a better alternative for transportation Uh-huh  that's terrific Uh-huh I guess as an adult for just about the past three years or so you know I guess last time I did it before that was college which was about ten years ago And yeah I guess I just never really thought about it much for a while until I suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot And so I thought I'd try it too No I haven't no  Uh-huh that's great Yeah I've I've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse You know it gets it down to about forty Yeah Yeah Yeah On average yeah No I'm not that hard-core there are some people in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow They've got a mountain bike you know with the big knobby tires And I don't do that I basically I I pretty much lay off for the winter I was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter you know because it will help your balance when you're indoor training but I just you know more or less stocked like an exercise bike and that kind of thing but yeah winters are kind of a problem so I'm more or less out of shape now that I've been biking I guess this year for just a couple of weeks but you know up here it's only stopped snowing since then but yeah it's it's it's it's pretty good It's the main the main thing I guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like you know exercise and a chore I'll lay off it more yeah yeah I try to go someplace pretty different you know every week I rotate around about four different routes from my house or I'll sometimes come in the school It's nice coming it's it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path because it's just it's along the Erie Canal up here University of Rochester So it's fairly picturesque And so it's it's it's a good ride as long as you're not doing it every day it's a good ride Yeah Yeah it was good talking to you Okay you too Bye
