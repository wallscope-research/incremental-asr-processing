Okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Really okay well see I'm the third oldest of twelve children So like I said I and I'm only twenty-one I'll be twenty-two next month So there's nine that are younger than me My youngest sister is five And like I sa- I don't have any children I'm just engaged and I'm getting married in October and we haven't discussed this at all Yeah exactly But now I've noticed that like while I'm at college and when I go home my bro- you know my I'm really close to the younger ones and like when when like when I do go home they enjoy just laying around me you know like if we do watch T V at night they just like enjoy just like laying on top of me or something They like that But as far as that goes like we play games I play like Old Maid and Fish with them and w- we play board games and when it's ni- like I'm from Pennsylvania so when it's nice out we go outside and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff So We do a lot of that And in the summer everyone is like I think there's like seven of us still at home and all seven are in a sport like also the girls are in softball and the boys are in baseball So all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports that's it you know Uh-huh Yes Right yeah we go and watch Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Well it's funny because well my mom and dad both were kind of athletic They both grew up on a farm but although you know it wasn't them playing I notice like whenever I was playing softball and such my mom and dad got into it more than I did they'd be in the audience screaming and yelling you know so A lot of times the parents get into it just as much as as the kids and I found like a lot of times like when we went on to tournaments and stuff it was really funny because the crowds would like get into argu- you know get into fights who can scream louder and you know everything So it's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it and they're not really even participating Yeah Uh-huh Yeah it's the the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you real- we really don't have any privacy when we're at home because you couldn't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms But like I say you know I'm twenty I'll be twenty-two next month and I'm closer to the younger kids than I am the ones my own age And that's I think that's because we- the ones that are older all have their own little thing to do and the younger kids are at home and I like to spend time with them So I don't I don't you know We were all pretty close when we were younger Yeah now that we're getting older people are get- you know each one of us are going our own direction Uh-huh yeah And we you know we had blocks and stuff and we just did we would make like in the winter when it wa- we couldn't go outside because of the snow and stuff we we would clear out our basement and we would like do just even stupid things like we try hurtling our couches and stuff You know and Yeah we would just run and jump over the couches Yeah to see who could jump over you know We just made up our own stupid little games And like hide and seek well we have a a bigger house than a lot you know our house isn't the average small one So we could like play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that Yeah Well see they're we're all like we're all pretty close together Like m- my sister that's closest to me we're only fourteen months apart So there was always there was never just one alone you know Right So we were all pretty close where we we always had a buddy to play with you know No no not at all Not at all Uh-huh Uh-huh Well yeah I'm Catholic Uh-huh No not at all Not at all But see when I was younger I used to say that I would like to have five Well I've even cut that down now and but to me five wasn't even a lot because I was just so used to twelve You know But yeah it's so it would be really hard now to have twelve children Well Well okay well like my oldest brother he's he's twenty-four and he put himself through college and there's a sister older than me she's still living at home but she works you know and I think she even gives mom and dad a little bit you know of rent money And I'm putting myself through college and like I'm getting married in October and my fianc3e and I are paying for most of the wedding And then then my brother right behind me he moved out and he has an apartment and he works and then the next one down is in the Marines and he's out of the house So it's kind of like they don't you know I I think they do Uh-huh Exactly Like well I find it a lot when I'm up here at college because I've always had a bank account I've always had my own checking account since I was in like tenth grade You know I would work in the summer and there's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or you know to to manage money Like my roommate's laughing at you know at me you know because their schooling's paid for Yeah uh-huh Yeah Yeah And see and then my mom and dad like whenever like we would go out and we would get a summer job and then we would start blowing money and my mom said well that's stupid for you to be blowing money She goes okay if your going to blow your money on other things she goes you can just pay for your life insurance So then we when we all graduated from hi- college from high school we all got we're still like I'm still covered under my mom and dad's life insurance because I'm still in school but I have my own policy too So I had a poli- you know my mom and dad got it set up you know you know helped me to get it and everything and I have my own policy and then I pay for my own life insurance too And then And then like my mom and dad because there's so many of us and because of the way the laws are you know now if we want to drive we have to pay for our own insurance on our cars Because my mom said that's silly to let one of the older one's drive it if we were in a wreck you know you can be sued for anything now And she said that's really not fair to the younger kids If we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad and the little kids would have nothing And I I agree with her You know I just I don't know So if you know if we want to drive we pay our own insurance and Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh
