Okay well I can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows and they kind of are in different spectrums I think one of them is QUANTUM LEAP and the other one is NIGHT COURT And I think I think they're real different I don't think they have anything in common QUANTUM LEAP has QUANTUM LEAP is kind of a comedy in its own way I guess but mostly it's it's kind of science fiction and it's it's adventure and things like that and then NIGHT COURT is just pure you know weird fun you know just it's it's nothing serious about it at all So I don't know why the two of them happen to be my two favorite shows but they that's the way it is so Uh-huh He is Yeah that's right  Well they they really have changed him though If If you've watched it this season he's becoming he still is in his own way degrading and everything but he's involved in that charity and it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has in fact there was one show that he even turned down a date with some you know beautiful woman just because the idea that he was his mind was on the ozone layer and you know global warming and all this other kind of stuff And he you know was too depressed you know to so that was part of I guess his character building or whatever but Which of course he needed Uh-huh Right right that's a good point So what do you what do you consider your favorite shows Okay Dede Yeah I agree Yeah I can't remember what her name is but is Uh-huh Well but see I read an article about in T V GUIDE about about HUNTER and about his you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them and they say that that there was abso- that there was like a conflict between her and him that they never really could get her into any character that they could use you know yeah the second one the blond you know if you think about it they didn't really interact hardly at all they were never partners Yeah And and and even even at the beginning Dede and and Hunter would decide that one of them would go do this while the other one would do would go this but it seemed like it was almost two different organizations you know like Hunter was the boss and this other girl was not and you know you kind of you're wondering you know well when did this happen So yeah I I kind of agree with that Well I'm afraid that's what they they really wanted to do Uh-huh Yeah well see there was that spark between Dede and Hunter for a while but they they like started it and then they'd pull it back and they'd start it and pull it back And that really made it a very interesting show to where you never really knew which which one was going to show up You know whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners you know And that that I kind of thought was good but you know it's I guess you know you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together and you always wonder why they don't you know get together or whatever And so I guess that's what they decide to do Yeah But it's it's always been a formula for T V that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married that the show ends up you know dying A a good example of this and you know this is probabl- maybe it's not a good example I've been watching Nickelodeon all last week because they had what they called MAXIMUM SMART They had GET SMART for ten hours a day from seven o'clock at night until six or until five o'clock the next morning All the GET SMART episodes you could ever see Well the the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them got married and that was that was the killer the series died right after that because well go ahead Uh-huh same thing Yeah the it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married you know the minute they get married everything's supposed to be cut and dried and and well of course another one of their mistakes I think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the characters' personalities well especially after they get married couple of examples would be well like I said this one about Max S- Get Well Smart the female character Barbara Feldon she had been at the beginning the the intelligent one the the one who always solved the things and and figured out and kept Max from getting real messed up Well in short whenever they got married she got dingy You know why would they do that It made no sense Unfortunately that's probably true Well do you you watch what is that show WHO'S THE BOSS That's that's on Tuesday nights I think Yeah well I I hardly ever watch it but as as I've seen it they've they've done sort of the same thing to where they've they started to let them get together and then they pulled them apart and I think they're thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them get together then you lose part of what the show's all about So I always thought that was kind of weird Uh-huh right Do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret or at least they keep it quiet  Yeah No like Madonna and Sean Penn Now I don't particularly like either one of them but their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together or at least that's the way I look at it So I don't know Yeah I would think so Yeah it's they wouldn't be easy So well that's kind of interesting So well I guess that's about all we need to do isn't it Yeah it has been Becky I really appreciate it Well I think I've you're the second female I've talked to Yeah it's kind of nice Uh-huh Bye-bye
