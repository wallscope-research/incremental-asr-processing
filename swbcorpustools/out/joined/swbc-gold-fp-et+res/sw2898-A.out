All right I had to register us in there Hopefully you're a basketball fan Hopefully you're a basketball fan Great I'm glad you are I'm not I couldn't care about any of it But go ahead I I would like to talk about maybe college basketball I'd like to see it be more of an amateur sport I'd like to see it turned back to like the Southwest Conference down here I would like to see Texas and all the teams since we're supposed to talk about specific teams I would like to see them turned back to where the college player plays for four years and then they're not they're not semi-pro and just go on and are stolen by the N- the the League you know in three years plus I'd like to see them to be true athletes where they're they're taking a regular college course You know I'd like to see they didn't ask that but they're talking about college teams I you know Since you're being you can talk for hours go ahead you you if you like sports go right ahead with this one Yeah That's surprising that they that they have better requirements That's good That's what I like to see Go ahead I'm all for that That's great Oh Yeah I I agree I think that that there's a lot of inconsistencies when some conference players come from outside of Texas you know and play us here they're obviously practicing sixty hours a week you know and there's no consistency Seems to me that like Purdue when they're trying a student athlete is spending so many hours in class He only has twenty twenty-five whatever hours he has to spend on practice He should be playing they all should be playing another team that that has about twenty hours to practice a week But there are teams that practice sixty hours a week they're not going to class at all that's that's what I mean by semi-pro There's too many semi-pros in college and I think they ought to get rid of that Well I'm all for I'm all for the baseball has a a minor league system and I think that the football and basketball they asked us to talk about basketball should you know let let them go have a semi-pro team But I think I'd like to see college athletes let's talk about college basketball I like that Any basketball that I like I like that I I don't I don't like the pros at all they're high scoring there's no defense it seems like and they just kind of score a hundred twenty five points you know hundred twenty-two you know and I don't really get much out of that Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah I like high school football which again is not the subject but that's so much fun to watch because they're they're pure amateurs you know and there's no money involved You go to college you don't really know it loses it somewhere Whatever sport it is if they're really putting a lot of money in these players let's face it ninety percent are being paid So I'd like to see college basketball and all the other sports go back to being amateurs I don't care about seeing the best players in the world play I like to see the people going to Texas just play the ones that are in class And I'd like to see athletes or fellow students like myself you know to play the game I I in fact I like amateur sports I don't see it has to be I don't think that college football or basketball should have to be semi-pro you know I wish it'd return to the good old days of the amateur Everybody play/ That's what I like everybody should play you know Yeah Well again I'd just like to see the true athlete the true student athlete play basketball you know I don't like to see the ones that aren't have no intention of going to class Then again just picking a school Texas is is usually not the best team you know because the other teams are I'm sure practice a lot more and S M U down here in footballs and trying to get back to having true student athletes and and that's what I think is a lot of fun To win and money yeah Yeah I always thought that col- university was for an education and then sports of course is part of the education I don't think that sports has to make a lot of money or you do away with it I don't know why the don't keep fencing and all that you know And and they seem to be there's articles in the TIME magazine and all about whether it be basketball or anything else If it's not making money then we'll do away with it Well that's not I thought it was so that you give them an education of that particular discipline And I I I just think that amateur sports should stay in universities that's where it's at I'm sure saddened to see I think it was Wisconsin or somewhere they were getting rid of fencing and a couple of other things I don't know what it was It just seems so sad to have to only rely on you know college football Is that all they're going to have to make money you know But I didn't think that was the objective to make money But it seems like it is Uh-huh Uh-huh You went to Indiana University Purdue okay Well good You're you're a T Ier up in Sherman very good Yeah yeah I'm in the facilities there down here in Dallas certainly high school football and college football but again high school football is just so much fun to watch because you know not everybody plays of course but they're still it's good and it's still you know the kids and there's absolutely no money involved whatsoever and you know they're going to class you know It it's it's real amateur sports Huh-uh Huh-uh Is that right Forty- I never heard that's I never been in a bask- football game in high school that had that many Well my office mate here Earl he he goes to all the Maverick games and he loves that He he would be this is a great question for him to talk about basket- Like he's got I'm looking at his calendar he's got all over the place and he goes to a lot of the Maverick games and everything But I I I can't get interested at all zero I I listen to him and occasionally I'll watch them on channel eleven but gee I can't more than five minutes of a basketball game just seems about that's it of pro anyway Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I'm surprised a little bit when you're talking about basketball how some players work Mavericks had two players this year that they got rid of last year I'll think of them in a minute Perkins Sam Perkins can't think of the other one They're both Pardon me Yeah Tarpley and they both left this past year and both of them were on playoff teams so they benefitted tremendously by leaving the Mavericks And Sam Perkins here he's one guy I did follow from think he was in Virginia I can't think of what school he went to but from I guess he's been here about five six seven years in the pros And he was he never quite achieved the you know the super stardom that he had in in college but basketball they have a nice I don't know if you've down to the sports for Reunion Arena It's
