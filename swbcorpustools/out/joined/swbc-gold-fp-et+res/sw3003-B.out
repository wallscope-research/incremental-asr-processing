Well no it's probably going to be a very old used one My husband had an accident in my car a little over a week ago and I drove a nineteen seventy-seven B M W and so I believe and I'll know the answer today that they're going to total it I think that it will cost more to fix it than it's probably worth But I'm not interested in having any car payments so I actually went last weekend with my father was in town and we went and looked at used cars around town and I you know I found like a nineteen eighty-four Regency Ninety-eight with only forty-six thousand miles on it and that was pretty good condition But I also found a nineteen eighty Volvo station wagon that was in just super condition there's not a dent on the outside body the inside is clean it's had the same owner for years It it has about eighty thousand miles on it but that's all right you know the engine's in excellent shape and I think it would last me probably another fifty or sixty thousand miles So I guess I'm kind of in limbo waiting to see what the insurance is you know company is going to do to see whether or not I can get one of these cars I don't want a new car though a new car payment  Uh-huh Well not only that needing the room you know we finally ended up buying a Dodge Caravan here about two and a half years ago because I too have very small kids I I have one that's now well she'll be four in September and then a little boy that's just turned two And you know it's like you go on a trip and you know you pull over to the side of the road throw them on the hood change a diaper and keep going And I wanted something that I could maybe walk through and get to them and Well Yeah Yeah Yeah We have definitely put a lot of use in on ours and I understand it is too expensive to have two car payments See that was the problem my B M W was paid for and my husband's been in business for himself for several years and so he can depreciate cars but you hav- used to be you kept them three years Well when they did all the tax law changes you had to keep them five So I was trying to keep my B M W in tact for three more years So that then I could take the van and we'd trade my car in on a new car for his business And so basically that's what I'm looking for in a used car Something that's going to last me at least three years Well if I can pull a deal on this Volvo you know it will last me longer than that It will actually last me quite a while but I don't know how families afford two new car payments It's just it's outrageous Uh-huh Uh-huh That's right Know how that goes <> It's the pits isn't it That's right <> I know you can't find what you used to could find something for you know seventy-five a hundred dollars a month It might not be brand new but it was a decent car and you just almost can't find that payment anymore So I understand that it's it's kind of hard to go do Well if you do look at them I really recommend the Dodge Caravan We've had wonderful it's the only minivan they make that's on a car chassis instead of a truck chassis so it doesn't you know shake you around like a tu- a truck does And we have had just wonderful luck with ours it's we take it everywhere it it's been it it's so easy to get the kids in and out see my car was also a two door And which drove me nuts trying to get car seats and kids into a back seat you know And so it's wonderful to have the room and the space and you can haul things and they climb in easily and it's just been everything that we were hoping it would do for us And it is nice on long trips In fact Christmas we drove to California which is my home and you can take out the middle seat and they come out fairly easily so we took out the middle seat put the car seats in the back and just had a whole area in the middle like if we were out on open road and it was their nap time we just went ahead and laid them down You know I wouldn't do that if we were in a city or if there were a lot of cars around or anything But it made it so much easier to travel Uh-huh yeah Sure it's a long time Uh-huh Right Well that would be good That would be good Well I appreciate talking to you Good luck in your car buying Well really I'm supposed to hear today and I I hope it I really would prefer the Volvo I think jus- I know it's older than the Regency but you know they're built of that unibody steel construction and it would take a hit fairly well and you know my B M W that my husband was going forty to forty-five miles an hour and you know it didn't even bend the frame It bent in the bumper and the quarter panel but unfortunately they think if it says B M W on it that you have money They don't know
