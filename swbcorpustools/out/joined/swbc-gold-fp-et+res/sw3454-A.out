what do you think are the major social changes What age if you don't mind me asking well you're you're young I'm in my early fifties so you should take my word you're young Every day Yeah I can believe that That's that's social change Well what do you think is is the major social change Right now Okay I think probably the big major change is the role of women I think one the women in the work force And I think the fact that they're becoming more how do I want to say not necessarily politically inclined but they're more apt to be in political offices now I think you know we've made great strides in that respect I think that it thirty years ago when I was newly married family was very very important Then I think we veered where the family was not as important a unit And I think now it's revolving back full circle I think the family unit is becoming much more important than it was That's true that's true Well I know that economically a wife almost has to work anymore And yet I'm also noticing in the areas that I'm working and stuff more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago they didn't you know they wanted children but they still wanted to be their own person out in the work force But I see I am seeing women now wanting to stay home more at least until the children are up to you know school age And I find that very interesting that that it's sort of reverting back Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Probably Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah yeah it is It I I note that I had taken care of my grandchildren recently while my daughter and her husband had been out of town And I do not envy these mothers or these fathers that have these the children that they have to rush home from work and pick them up at day care get them through their homework get them to their soccer practice get them to their piano lessons that's tough I don't envy these young parents That's true That's true I don't know And and I'm finding you know running into these women that are wanting to have their children at the age of thirty-nine forty I'm thinking at the age of fifty-two you're crazy You're going to be doing your worst running around when you're fifty And you're absolutely nuts Well you can be go getting but you can also get gray hairs and have a nervous breakdown I just know it it would absolutely exhaust me Maybe it's because it's my grandchildren and it's not my children Maybe that's
