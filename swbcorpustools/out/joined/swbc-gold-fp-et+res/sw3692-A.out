They're talking about federal government aren't they Yeah Well I saw a program on recently and and it said every time they cut you know like fifty-five million dollars on a certain thing then they brag about how much money they cut and then they go and spend that money somewhere else and that's why the budget is never balanced The Gramm Rudman Act didn't solve the problem They just take all the money that they say they cut and they spend it somewhere else or they you know they pad out their staff or you know spend it in bounced checks at the commissary or Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I think they should they should limit the Senate to one term one six year term Uh-huh Right and and don't let them come back and and keep Congress to two terms of two years a piece and then it'll be overturning and they won't have the same people there all the time and then all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks and that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence Because that's one of the things one of the biggest things is that the fact that they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or another whether it's the oil companies or the automotive companies and like the air bag thing The air bag came out what twenty years ago And only now they're getting that put in cars And the oil companies are really aren't responsible you know The Valdez proved that and then the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything It should have been done immediately Uh-huh Right No They listen to wherever the money is Right Yeah they're not as efficient that's for sure
