All right I guess tonight's subject is to discuss current events and how we keep up on current events and if we're satisfied with with the coverage that we receive thinking about it some of the ways I try and keep up on current events is I enjoy reading the newspaper but quite often don't have time to read all of the newspaper and so I enjoy watching some of the T V highlights and also some of the news periodicals weekly magazines and at work I also have management summary reports that give basically a lot of the current events how about yourself Uh-huh Right right yeah Okay You think that that's pretty adequate coverage and you get Uh-huh It's historic events huh okay Yes Yeah I found out too that quite often if I see something on television that I want more in-depth understanding or or get want to know more about it that the the newspaper or I read NEWSWEEK can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what I've heard on T V but I found out that also on on T V that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on C N N and and like you said the the news shows that are that are happening and you can read some more about it if you want to I found out though that or I feel that a lot of the stuff on T V and the newspapers is negative There's an awful lot of negative news or bad news or or bad news And it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news And Yes we do True true Uh-huh I've heard an interes- interesting comment also that with budget cuts and expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or investigative reporting on certain topics and issues but that takes time that takes an awful lot of money and commitment and and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing and go after you know it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer and find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things so I don't know I guess the economy is is effecting also the news media and we have to pay that price but I don't know I don't know It's interesting and I think that nowadays with communications the way they are also that we can see global events happening as as they occur all over the world like the Exactly We saw Yes you know twenty years ago thirty years ago we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or or luxury to to view that So yes Uh-huh yeah Yeah
