Okay <> Yes I did I went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia it was Sweeper College of about seven hundred and fifty students I had gone to a small school growing up and a lot of my friends went to univert- University of Michigan but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when I graduated and were looking for a southern school and also U of M seemed overwhelming in size and what about you so you're from the Midwest too I live in Texas now Where are you my brother's in Austin he lives Lakeway He had moved we're in Plano And Austin is so pretty I really like it <> And your daughter is going to be a sophomore Is because you live in Austin is she thinking about the University of Texas Oh Yes Uh-huh Those and those were several that we did consider my parents certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south and because I had been in a small school they suggested that I probably I when I say small my graduating class had eighteen in it And so they suggested that I might want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of one-on-one small group situations And I did pick it because at the time I was interested in majoring in biology and I also wanted to spend one year studying in Europe I had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing and I ended up majoring in French One of the reasons I picked the school was because they had a strong science department They also had a strong language department and I'd always loved working with children and I found that I couldn't fit everything in but because I had had a fair amount of French going in I was able to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me and so that was some of but several of the things you mentioned were the things that our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M He but he thinks he wants to be a writer and I don't think that Yes and really his his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand and so he's used to a bigger size and because my brother is there he would have family close by So there there are advantages but I also because I had so many friends who did go from our small school to University of Michigan which was so large and they really felt like they were numbers You still Yeah Well th- that's certainly especially today with the cost of college that is a a major consideration and I do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools And even though Baylor and when you mentioned that we we have friends who have children there who just love it And for a private school it is not as expensive as most are and it is a smaller size and I do feel like there are a lot of options It's it's but I had been hoping some schools I know give even this year Jay had an aptitude test Yes he thinks that's what he'd like to do but he's really strong in math and science too and we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind Does your daughter know what she'd like to do Yeah Yes Uh-huh Yes Well he but he has even now that he's in high school and of course there's there is still time but he's beginning to feel that as much as he enjoys writing he wonders if he can make a living at it You know it's the it's
