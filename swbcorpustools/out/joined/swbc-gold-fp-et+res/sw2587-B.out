I usually don't get to hea- hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news you know being by the time you get off work go by and pick up the baby from the baby sitter it's you know after six and by the time everything is settled in it's ten o'clock before I can catch up on anything Uh-huh yeah uh-huh I don't even have ge- time to read the newspaper except in passing you know I'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on But Yeah We have a news thing on the computer that that I'll I'll try to look at every day And it it's pretty much headline news Which isn't you know pretty much what we loo- look for anyway But I do you think that the quality of the the you know the news events that you get are what do you think about it Uh-huh Yeah Well you know there's a lot of competition in the media And sometimes I think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines And that they'll run a topic into the ground And You know they try to play public's opinion Which I think is awful because it usually works Yes uh-huh That l- lots of new newsmen were created during that so it will be interesting to see what happens Right  Yeah I hate to see that but it's i- that you know if what it's going to take well you know we can deduct that from our income tax our federal income tax But you know but we need good schools we're more involved in that now And I I I I think it's better for everybody if we had better schools So No You know I wish they could have gotten a lottery Yeah I think you know the lottery could have helped with that it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax probably would have paid the same amount but you know it's not the idea of your paying income tax So No It'll be interesting to see what happens I you know I haven't seen the news in a couple of days So it I'm a little behind on things Yes that's that's sad Yeah They yeah they had to choose between the better of the two two bad situations and I don't know what I've would have done in the situation Yeah Right But I understand why Bush you know doesn't want to go in and and take sides because that would definitely look like another Korea and he'd have all these people jumping down his back even though I'd agree with it I think he ought to should've gone in there and blew them away Yeah it it it did a lot He did a real good job I believe I have in-laws that live in Saudi Arabia that stayed there during all of it too It it you know we so we kept very much abreast of what was going on Yeah they were on the the ne- near Dahran On the on the wes- east coast They were just north of it Probably about a hundred fifty miles hundred miles from the Kuwaiti border and they stayed active was the the military there Taking supplies out to them in the desert It was it was a new situation I don't really have much more to say You're right and that's that's awful in Texas We got some awful rain the other morning And today's just been real drizzly Yeah Uh-huh It did well We we've just got slight chances of rain But we had the we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning Course while everybody was getting ready to go to work Making nice traffic jams So <> Oh <> Right when was it last week we had all the rain But we I think we had about eight inches It was between six and eight inches here where we are And it you walk out on the ground you it's awful It's just so soggy Yeah Well today it was the air was just so sticky so damp Goodness Right Well it's Right Well it was nice talking to you All right Bye-bye
