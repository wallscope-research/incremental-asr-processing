Okay I don't know which end do we push but okay Right yeah That's true you know a lot of people I think the that it ends up the people that vote every time elections come around are more the the polly the party type followers the guys that you know follow the party lines you know and they you know just go in and if they're Republican they vo- vote Republican every year you know and the people that are independent you know are the ones that don't don't really show up every year because they can't seem to to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate Yeah Ye- I always thought it was back when Anderson was running I was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes but that didn't work Uh-huh Yeah yeah that's and then and then people always get upset about it too because you know every year the the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote they they each think that if more people vote they'll get more votes I'm always amazed at that that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know Yeah well that I know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a pr- pr- predominately Catholic type area and when things start when when abortion comes on the issues and people just get all insp- inspired you know and still on the other hand we're also this particular community is a Catholic community but down in D C where where things are a little bit different you know it's it's women's rights and the and that sort of movement and so it's quite the opposite so elections start getting very the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones But Yeah I can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for the the Midwest and it doesn't matter who they put in office they're going to fall subject to the pressure that the lobbyists can put Right Yeah Yeah Well I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year I think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected  Uh-huh Unfortunately that will probably even drop lower the voters turndown even more because more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot so they won't even bother turning out They'll just say well you know the Republicans have this election we'll see you in four years hope some of the local well that's what they they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the at the booths they they say that these older voters that you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country so they they don't come out turn out to vote and they're the ones that you know really know what's going on have the experience and seen you know how politicians can you know screwup or what ever But I know my grandmother hasn't voted in years Yeah wonder if they're going to take into account this computerized conversation that there's little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time your talking No I can't hear them yeah Yeah Washington D C Uh-huh okay Well I figured with Texas Instruments they'd probably have a few Texans on the line now and then No huh-uh they they went through engineering companies and we're communications I I work in a communications company Yeah sort of different They called me at ten o'clock one night that was very strange I guess they were doing Eastern Standard Time I was like I don't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes Yeah Uh-huh Okay Yeah Okay well if your ever in D C come look up Wayne Sherman you'll say yeah talked to that guy Oh Okay Yeah yeah so do we Yeah right next to Dulles All right I'll talk to you later Bye-bye
