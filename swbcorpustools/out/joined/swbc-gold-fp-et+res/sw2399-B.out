Personally I do not care for them although I find them a necessity in business and so forth I I try to refrain from their use as much as possible for a number of reasons one of which is the you know extreme interest rate on most of them The one I use of course for mostly only for business purposes is you know American Express And I'm not I'm not terribly in favor of them Not for my own personal point of view Plus it has you know from an economic point of view it has increased our debt tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion I believe at least that's one number for this range of numbers I have I have heard Do you use them frequently or Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh I find the one I use mostly aside from the American Express I do use my Sears card But I try a- as with the American Express I try to pay it you know as it comes in So I know when I travel when I used to travel overseas quite a bit what I would do on my American Express card is before I would before I left I would mail a check to to American Express and you know have some idea of how much was there you know I'd sent them you know several hundred dollars or whatever I felt I would spend And then use it then But for hotels and and so forth But but I knew that it was paid I knew I knew that I had that much credit going in Sometimes you know sometimes I would go over but it wouldn't you know it wouldn't hit me in a big in a big way because I knew that I would have it covered in that respect Well I found I found in in traveling overseas that often it would it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card for hotel bills and so forth Plus I would when they would send the bill they would automatically convert to the exchange rate So now the only time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically for example I remember on one trip to France when I started planning the trip I think a dollar was worth nine or ten francs  This looks like funny parsing to me Shouldn't "francs" be part of previous utt and B64 with it's coordinating conjunction and indep clause start a new slash unit  and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc drastically See note on B62 utt2 above  And whe- when I finally got over there it had fallen two or three francs to the dollar So the So I got caught a little short in that regard but I I was anticipating you know my room would cost let's say if it were say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so or maybe twenty dolls- maybe it would be more than that It was more than It would average out to thirty-five or forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate But then when I got back and I was working for the government at the time of course the government was several months behind in their on its per diem for exchange rate So there's a little consternation you know in trying to get them to compensate for the difference in the exchange rate That was the only time I really got caught short And I But as I said most most of all I try not to use them to any you know lavishly in that regard Well from where are you calling So you're from Dal- okay I'm from Maryland Yeah No I work for G T E Yes Well I know Jack Godfrey I know him very well I've known Jack for a long time and I'm also in the speech business So when I heard that Jack was going to do this I called him and asked for an application where I could participate in this And so that's how I got involved Thank you very much But as Jack said I'm one of the the old hands in the speech business Yeah Yes I I've been doing it for twenty some odd years And so I was very much interested in getting involved in switchboard So you work for T I really I guess we're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording Alright Okay fine Well you have a good evening It's been pleasant talking to you Take care Good night
