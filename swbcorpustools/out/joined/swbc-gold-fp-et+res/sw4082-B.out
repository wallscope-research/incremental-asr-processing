Yes I actually get most of my news coverage off computer networks However I do also watch television news usually in the morning once a day and I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL most every day well well DOW JONES for example have the cause the news wire and it's picked up and actually available at my office so it's no fee or subscription either to read at my leisure and it's sort of by category For example so I can read a certain business or topics Well it's similar to that but it's DOW JONES which is the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire well actually not I do follow I don't know how to how to describe it so I'll say a religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense It's a weekly but but not not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things I'd like to say that however that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires I think that it I think that it has to do with I personally think I I have a problem with their viewpoint and I personally think that ther- that there's a strong bia- there's a strong bias in the media Yeah Absolutely after all who who writes People who are journalist who are trained to write and they're that's a liberal a liberal field at least from academia and the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in I find their descriptions to be wrong and it That's right Well even if it's not technical If it's some social thing or whatever It doesn't matter If I am an expert in it they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think I'm not expert in it They're telling me lies I think both by deliberate I I mean mistake mistakes of omission or or biased toward a particular view point a particular liberal view point that they have So to give you an example we will go out of the printing media I know of cases where we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you Which is sort of like a deliberate bias Which is which is rather disturbing he does that Yeah I don't have access either Although I did at one time and it was I did during the Gulf War and it was addictive Yeah well during that small sample I would think that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks radio television programming So if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by turning on C N N and you
