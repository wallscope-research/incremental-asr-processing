Right actually I lived over in Europe for a couple of years I lived in Germany and in Germany they don't have the jury system What they do is they have three judges basically And you get up there and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence and your defense attorney presents their evidence and those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not  Uh-huh Wow Well you know it's it's one of those things I would have to look at it I- if they did it with the just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures they know what's good and what isn't they'd be able to say I'm sorry you can't use this as evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever and you know you wouldn't have this theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the to the jury and then the judge says no d- disregard that Come on any jury's not going to disregard the evidence you know That may very well be  Yeah That's true You d- Well How would you go about changing it Leave the details up to somebody else Yeah Well you know talking about the lawyers you know what might very well do cause a a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases It's kind of like do it do it in the similar vein similar like V C R or television repair If you take your T V in a lot of these T V repair places will say well I'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it He he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars Now if he comes in and says you know I'll repair your your V C R or somebody else's V C R for a hundred dollars gets in there maybe it's a blown fuse takes him two minutes he fixes it he still charges you that hundred dollars So maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that you know whether it's a murder case or a you know a civil somebody suing somebody else you get X dollars for that case and that's it None of this yeah Yeah That's true Yeah y- well you you know you're talking to part of them that's paying for that That's right You know that's it it's it's amazing and and when you stop and look at it the judges th- they're all former lawyers
