Well I don't I don't know what you think about the subject I'd the I had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the the sentencing to to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that I've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while I was waiting for them to phone somebody and I don't know that that's not a good idea I agree Uh-huh yeah I agree Yeah I don't like that no I don't like that at all I know my husband served on a on a jury a few months ago up here in Denton but it was a guy it was it was a drug conviction and I don't remember he had some cocaine and th- it was accused of selling it and I don't remember exactly how much he had but actually not selling it there's a difference cr- cro- couriering it is what ther- is supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier and he was a courier And they he's he sat on that jury and they found him guilty and they went through the sentencing phase and everything and you know they were told that you know during the trial that this is this guy's first offense and he's got this clean record and and they ended up the jury you know decided it's time to crackdown here you know and it was time to do this drug thing and let's crackdown and let's really and they sentenced him to fifteen years you know which they thought first offense okay this is they thought that that was that was a good thing And they sentencing him to fifteen years and after it was all over the jud- they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers <> let me come over in just a second okay and sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers and they were told that he would probably serve three of the fifteen and that he had three previous convictions However they could not tell the jud- the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal So the jury didn't know about it so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy's first offense and so you know we'll give him fifteen which will teach him a lesson but it's not just you know horrible since it was first offense and he'd been convicted three times before you know and and the jury was very upset and my husband came home a home very upset he felt like that that they had been tricked you know and so something I wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change you know That's true That's very true Yeah Yeah obviously what we are doing is not working you know No Yeah and there's you know there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way shape or form and either they're in there forever or when they get out they're you know it's a matter of a few months and they're going to be right back for the same thing so the system That's very true Yeah I was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day and I said you know I understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the United States to and and the and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive but I really believe that we need to take care of ourselves we and and the- I know people say it would be cruel to you know pull our aid from these other countries and and maybe so so tell them you've got five years To work out a plan to make it on your own And we will continue funding you for the next two years after two years we'll cut it down seven to seventy fiv- you know seventy-five percent And after another year we'll cut it fifty percent and in five years it sh- by then you should all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help And then we'll have all we'll have we will have the money if we would do that to to work on your own system because we've got some serious problems here and we're trying to heal the world you know it's just not it's just not working I look at the I look at what you know thi- what the aid presented to the Kurds and I I feel sorry for them and I know they're suffering and I know they're dying everyday but we've got you know kids here in the United States that are dying everyday too You know and being abused and neglected and you know I don't know I just have this problem with trying to heal the world when you're so sick yourself you know so Yep I think we should try it like you say if it doesn't work we can always come back but I think it would be a good idea to try it So anyway well we all agree You too bye-bye
