We well my my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class He's an aerobics instructor And is going to be entering North Texas for a Kinesiology program there two utts And the the how I met him was through the aerobics class that he used to teach Yeah so I'm I'm an avid aerobics person and just very very athletic Enjoying a th- you know anything dealing with sports So and how do you feel about it Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah well I I've my that's the way my mother stands on it She feels like if it's something that you have to do you know if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes it becomes a chore and and she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore So and I feel that way too as far as you know just sitting and doing you know to the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something you know to you're a calcu- you know calculated down and do your calisthenics you know three times a week or but but I do try and I do try and regulate how much exercise I get a week Yeah And it's got and I've always enjoyed dance So it involves you know I I can't get out to dance all the time and Yeah and it's and it's more regulated I mean you're you're using different parts of the body So it it is like dance an- and it's structured like that but you have the music and someone like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me And someone else is telling me okay you know let's move this way let's move that way instead of me having to think about it so much Yeah yeah But I'm like you I also like to participate in things like well we just went to the Myererson Symphony Run this past weekend and and that was a lot of fun and you get to meet different people and just get out you know out and about and it's it it's something you can all like our we did it as a family so it was it was quite a lot of fun and biking and I I I love to swim so I love it when you know it's swimming weather and Oh I didn't realize that I'm sorry Well I'm in Texas I I just assumed that I had this is the first call I've done and I didn't realize that they ha- were going to reach out to people from all over the country You wouldn't know that I Uh-huh Well I think people are are more inc- people from California seem to be more health motivated all around as far as the diet and everything the diet and just your health consciousness and it just seems like a lot of those ideas generate out of California Not just exercise but health health related ideas And I it's curious I don't know why don't know if it's do you does California have a Uh-huh Uh-huh Now do you think that's because they've realized that for whole health that the you know you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program Do you think the program came first or the Yeah the more money they put into it I can see that And cause I knowing from institutes of learning like that I know that they've got to get their money somewhere and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it so Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Or they're older Well don't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar- I I sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city I live in a rural area so needs slash you know I see that sd It's yeah it's it's like it's frantic to you know to achieve something that that a person in a rural area almost doesn't worry about it to such a degree but stays you know almost healthier you know slash error; one utt with 116 as a fit person Uh-huh Yeah Well don't you think a lot of that is diet too Yeah Uh-huh Yeah and as we can see Well I'm a I'm a practicing vegetarian so I've read a lot of information knowing that to be true What's that are you also Well that's that's good as far as the cal- is that is that pretty predominant as far as California do- doe- In the urban areas Uh-huh that's wonderful Yeah That's great we it's such a chor- it's such a trouble here you just have to eat at home basically Well of course in the cities yeah well in the cities we live close to Dallas so which you know you get an influx of a lot of people from all over the country so you're going to have a lot of di- more choices but but in urban areas it's you know steak places an and it's not a you know it's it's definitely it it's it's changing to a degree but it's very frustrating slash error And even even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or organic you know materials and foods and things You don't really have that you would think
