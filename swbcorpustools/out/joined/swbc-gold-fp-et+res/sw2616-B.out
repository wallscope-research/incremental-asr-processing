Okay so I think I think what we should talk about is the war The war that just went on See I I don't agree with it First of all I don't believe in war And then the United States has this attitude by saying you know thank you for keeping us our freedom and stuff like that And I think it's all independent because it's it has nothing to do with the United States You didn't gain anything from it And it wasn't our freedom that you were saving It was just <> the thing the thing that that that I saw was okay Iraq wants to raise oil prices Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system by leaving them independent And so when Iraq you know saw this they said let's take over the country which is a good idea right Then the United States says okay our our oil prices are going to go up And like for example see okay like Lith- Lithuania right they declared themselves an independent country with a president right Russia goes in there well the main government in Moscow goes in there and they kick everybody's ass And the United States doesn't go in there and say listen they were you know named an independent you know state with a president and everything but we're not going to go into your country But these countries here which you know are you know like in NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR have you ever read that book Okay NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR there are like three big continents and there's just this area like around Egypt and stuff that everybody's fighting over Now the problem is is that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries Right like their immediate boundaries Like you're not going to go you know it's like the Army's not going to go straight into Russia because there you're you're invading their border right But all the other countries you can fight about And so the thing is is that you're wasting so much money to send you know it's like how much money did the U S spend when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being And you know it's it was basically all based on oil because nobody actually like for example if let's say if you know Brazil took over you know Surinam I don't think anybody would care You know and that's something that that has been you know very because see the thing is is like every time that I see a war I see myself on the front line and on the other side I see myself again and I've got to shoot myself you know I got to shoot somebody that's got the same family that I do You know the same relationships that I do And just because I was born here I've got to shoot them down And but at least it was it was over quick and there weren't that many deaths Now the only problem is is the aftermath that you're having so many deaths in the border with Turkey Well the- there's something that that the U S did right which is say say you know okay let's kick him out of Kuwait which was our basic goal And now indirectly let's try to overthrow him you know And they're not going to do that directly But the thing is is that they they didn't go into into Iraq and say you know because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country You know you can seek seek asylum here and you can go there but no way are you going to rule ever again Well the thing is is that first of all they got to they go- they have to get him And and there's no way that you can get them unless it's by force You know And then you can put him on trial No no I think I think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in because there's there's like it's like there's no hope you know like what Hitler did you know You know like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life but where You know and so the thing is is that once you've done something wrong which is natio- you know internationally recognized then you're going to try to get out of it and the there's no way you know And especially since he's got inside Iraq for using you know chemical weapons and stuff And you know like he sent planes over to to shoot the people down that were on the border with tha- that were on their way to Turkey He had a couple of them bombarded Huh-uh But you know he's got millions of dollars like th- I think it was like I don't know if it was fifty billion or fifty million which is really doesn't make any difference Yeah But it's just it's just that you know i- you know like the we just put our goals in different you know levels is like saying you know it's like yeah sure we need oil you know and we need it desperately But the other countries that you know that have oil but not as big you know like they say you know like when the prices went up and then they went down When they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia or something Well th- it its an advantage You know it's like you're saying okay I can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon and I'm not going to bring them back down to you know ninety-nine cents Why because people are willing to pay a dollar fifty a gallon so if I di- leave it at a dollar ten people are still going to pay You know I went down forty cents but I went up ten cents Yeah Ninety-eight God Here it's like it's like a dollar five Yeah But still the have you ever checked like the most money-makers in in nineteen ninety you can see that Exxon and Amaco and other companies God I forgot their names but Exxon was the number one money-maker and that was just because of of the last quarter Yeah And that was and what other companies are went up four hundred and some percent And that's practically impossible to do now a days for a company to to shoot up in that way And it's just that you know people people take advantage of that You know like the the companies are saying we're trying not to raise our prices but when you know when we get a barrel coming in at more than what we're selling it for we've got to raise our prices You know but still if you realize that one barrel has {D like how much was it like } forty gallons it's got forty gallons and they're selling you know you know you got to pay forty dollars at least and you know for for one gallon and it's it was selling like at twenty-five or something So you're making you know fifteen dollars profit easily And everything and and the expenses you know of the war you know it's like it's like who's gaining on this Okay because i- does does the U S government own any gas companies like like you know gas stations and stuff I because see like for example I don't know if the British government owns Shell I'm not sure about that But the thing is like the U S government got nothing out of it Because well you know it's like oth- the other independent companies the gas stations you know they did And then the taxes go up and then everybody else loses But you know they're just they're just some things that might not be worth it You know and and first of all how many how many people had to had to die before the war you know it's like transporting stuff and things like that before you know it's like yeah sure you know like to to a couple people that died there their families don't feel it was necessary to do that Yeah yeah you you could you could never bring them back well Yeah so okay nice talking to you Bye-bye
