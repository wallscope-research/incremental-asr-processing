Well you know they actually started and I assumed it was T I wide they they started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper I've you know either computer paper or different types of paper I've had some ideas on how I think they could probably do it a little less expensively and accomplish the same purpose but I I guess I need to put it on paper and turn it in  Well the way they have you know they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall or a lot of people aren't going to get up walk out of their offices and go there You know where I use to work we had what we called tree boxes That's just what we called them And they were recycled cardboard They were eight and a half by eleven and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there and when it filled up you called you know facilities whoever to come pick it up and they brought you another box So not only is it you know I think more people would take advantage of it and use it I think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step kind of type thing So Right If Right but somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together and whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full you close the box it's already bundled it's already done for you So you're saving a lot of time and effort I just need to put it on paper and I guess recommended it to somebody and see if they thinks it's feasible So what else do they do in the Dallas area Uh-huh  Anything extra That sounds good There's I I've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where you know from the kitchen where you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other or the the even there are areas that can recycle the the tin cans like your you know vegetable things come in and so I I've not done that but that's kind of what I want to set up so Because we do go through aluminum cans you know That's probably the one we use most but Find a place Well they they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers aluminum cans those are the two major items You know we can take oil like car oil recycled oil to they have dump areas like at the fire departments throughout town I don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans I think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles things like that but I I don't know I know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments So I do that <> I think people are becoming more aware You know of of the waste and you know I I like to see you know you drive through Burger King now and the bags are recycled paper and you know so you know I feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it You know maybe it's making an impact I'm not as good about searching something out like that but if I am there and the choice is there I would probably take the recycled product So you know that's just where I probably need to be a little more responsible citizen wise you know looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way So you know they are getting away from the styrofoam
