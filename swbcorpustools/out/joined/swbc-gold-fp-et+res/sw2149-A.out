<> So what do you think Should they should young Americans be forced to do a year of service Yeah I think something like the Peace Corps is a bit harsh No kids Vol- Yeah I think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two I I I'd force them I think that I think it would be I think mo- I think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it Right exactly I was a I was a Boy Scout As part of being a Boy Scout you had to do you know projects all throughout and then to become an Eagle Scout you have to spend a do a yearlong project Yeah I think I I now I think people generally volunteer That there's no problem with getting them to do stuff Well we have a funny commercial around here It says something like if people were to give five hours a week or five percent of their salary we could they could solve all the world's problems or something So I guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could or just or just gave or or or just forced our kids just to to force kids to serve for parents I guess Substitute My my + yeah my  kid will do four or five hours this week for me No problem Uh-huh I've seen that Yeah They they just started trying to get them something together l- l- like like that around here from for from the community because we had a big ice storm very very recently You don't sound like you're in the north You sound like you're in the south somewhere Yeah I'm in New York Upstate New York yeah And Long way And we just had a really big ice storm And basically half the trees in in our city I'm in Rochester which is right upstate Half of the trees in the city are no good anymore That's how bad it was Everything is just down everywhere You know we had three hundred thousand people without power You know it was and you know and and they and we didn't have power for a week and there are still people who don't have power yeah it's been it's been it's been ten days already and there are still something like ten thousand people without power and were officially + yeah and we're officially  in a state of emergency Funny thing is the news the national news how they covered it Yeah I think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something and and we've been in a state of emergency for over you know for ten or eleven days You know We just got our phone back today and and they're you know putting out ads now for people to come volunteer or to have their organizations come volunteer to help clean up the streets Because we have you know every- everywhere that a tree is down people need help and we're all all a lot of older folks need help getting their yards cleaned out because they can't afford to pay anyone and they and and they certainly can't carry it themselves and So that's great And is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth or so he That's real nice Right That that's real good And I and I bet it gives you a real good feeling to be doing that Yeah That's that's that's real good We had we had organizations like that in college you know We had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups and some did like that some did elderly visits some did some did you know Big Brother Big Sister stuff like that And I'm convinced that that that at least twenty-five percent of our school participated in some sort of a some sort of group You know ac- activity like that You know Twenty-five I don't know Twenty-five percent <> Yeah my wife was big in that And she thinks {A yeah } twenty-five percent It it was a small school But Yeah but a a a lot of people would get involved and you know because there were all different organizations to do There was Big Brother Big Sister they had a yearly auction they had a dance marathon for charity or to to support that group Such that you know lots of people got involved that way Yeah Yeah no neither do I I think it should be completely optional and you know Yeah they're not worth a year Or some people unfort- just just can't even afford it you know whatever the Peace Corps doesn't pay very well You know People get shipped off and then you know and then and then their parents I have a a a friend whose whose son is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala daughter is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala right now And you know he and his wife just went off to visit her and you know I know I could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala You know so so I think you know and and and the kid's certainly not making much money So I can see where that that may be a problem Just take off a year Yeah I don't Yeah yeah well neither can I so I I I I I I did my service before and I'll do my little community service throughout but never never for a year again So so I guess our vote is no Well it's been nice talking to you again Well yeah we're we're slowly getting everything back together again You know it it's taking time but everything you know we got lucky We had no damage to our house or anything so The rest will just have to come with time Well good luck to you too Bye-bye <>
