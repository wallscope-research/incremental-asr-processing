Yeah I guess it's an easy one for me I think that's there's something seriously wrong yeah I guess I think they've lost their compass and I'm not sure they know exactly what public education supposed to be for anymore But I voted with my feet and my kids go to parochial school So Well one hundred percent of the customers care That's one thing Everybody cares about the education the kids are getting And they take an active relatively active part Which if you're sending two thousand dollars that way every year you watch what goes on and you pay attention and participate and and you can influence the way things are Yeah The immediacy just isn't there And I also think that one of the problems and actually I don't think this I think this is a cultural problem The problem with public education is really really a problem with the culture And I guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school and you can't get a tax levy passed people are reluctant to pass school tax levies even when the money is needed or would be well spent because it's they don't have kids in the schools I think that's a a loss of civic virtue and a loss of the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids I think that's that's the principal problem is that people no longer see it as as their problem and there's an immediate problem Right Yeah Yeah You know I I believe that the original idea of public education in the United States which I guess was controversial at the time of the constitution you know it barely made it I think it was added afterwards I think the real the principal was education for civic participation The idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes Well that's exactly what I was going to say Now there seem to be really three reasons for education One is education for civic duty One is education for economic reasons And one is education for civilization and I think that one That's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor and then I quit and got disabused of that notion But the now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is an economic enterprise to train people for jobs And I'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is And I'm really sad to say this I never thought I would have but I really think that the educational establishment has become part of the problem And that's why I guess I'm sort of reluctantly in favor of these choice programs Right That's what
