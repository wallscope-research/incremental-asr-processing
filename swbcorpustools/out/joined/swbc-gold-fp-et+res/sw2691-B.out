I live in Dallas right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state And a uh it goes east and west and a north south tollway It's no it's called Six Thirty-Five's the highway It's the looper that goes around the city and then the tollway is called the Dallas North Tollway Just moved here about one about a month ago after twenty-one years two miles to the east So it's a very different house from the typical Dallas house It's about eight years old it's it's a duplex type thing very modern and very open and airy light So it's different than the than the long Texas ramblers Uh-huh What's your house like great yeah So it's got a lot of o- openness and light also it doesn't Well that's what my wife really wanted and so Yeah that's our our last house wasn't too bad but it was just too traditional and so if the n- the next time probably a year and a half from now we're going to try to build So make one really contemporary and and very modern and very open and very light No I have three in college They they usually get back for the at least two of them for the summer so But Still need a little bit of space We we have a lot less than we had recently Already cut back How big is your place that's good size Yeah We we had Yeah we had four bedrooms two and a half baths in the place we just left So down now we're down to two and two Uh-huh So it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home but it won't be that long because we not for sure you know how long they're going to stay or whatever So yes Yes and if you get in the if if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal we we really didn't go that route and didn't look but the planning of them and the the housing market probably still going to even go lower There are many many houses ju- for sale just by the regular route So Yeah And we just decided sell And we got we got a pretty good price for for what we had not as good as it would have been say three or four years ago But that that was just the timing Uh-huh Oh Yeah they're not moving very well For sure And that's a good example of it yeah I know where that is I've been we've been here for twenty-five years I'm from Missouri and my wife's from Kansas so I te- I teach at a college here So it's it's sort of home now So I'm at one of the Brook- it's called Brookhaven College It's one of the community colleges And it's just about two miles to the west of where I'm living So it's very nice very convenient Yeah Now Richland College is out it serves Richardson and Garland And that's about nine miles to the east of here So anyway well it's good to hear from you And I hope we hope we did them some good on their little computer dealy And have a good life the rest of it Bye-bye
