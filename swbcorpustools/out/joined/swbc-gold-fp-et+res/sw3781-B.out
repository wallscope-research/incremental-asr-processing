Well I suppose we both have credit cards Yeah Well I do use them I have a few favorites that I use more than others and I try to keep my balances fairly reasonable I I could probably pay them off any month if I wanted to but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few and they all can build up I think they're handy I just get I don't carry a lot of cash with me and I hate writing checks when you go shopping Well do you use credit cards Uh-huh Grandmother  Uh-huh That's good that's That's wonderful Well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you're savings is bringing It's really I guess ridiculous to let them keep building But I know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand Uh-huh yeah Well that's good I'm looking right now I'm k- kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate It seems that some of them have gotten higher and I saw on T V they had a program on credit cards and they're supposed to I don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country And I didn't write it down at the time and then I went and looked and to see what my visa was and I think it's eighteen percent or something so think I want to find something that has a lower rate No I haven't Is that the one from Sears Okay Okay Uh-huh they give you money back for using your credit card  I didn't know that Well you know Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards I worked w- at Sears for over ten years and it was only a Sears card that they would take until I guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted so you know now they'll take the Discover but I still don't know if Sears will take Visa or Mastercard But I never did apply for a Discover card I just figure with the Visa and American Express I probably have an I can do enough damage with those two Uh-huh Yeah I've got some that I you know I haven't even used at all past few years I probably wouldn't be able to use them But I I do like my Dillard's I have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop And I do use Dillard's probably as more than any of the other department stores But Well No not too much more about credit cards Okay well Good talking to you Beth Good luck You too Bye
