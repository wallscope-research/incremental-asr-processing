I get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio that is one of my big sources for current events information I really like that coverage My wife on the other hand is home most of the day and she watches a lot of the cable news network Have you seen + h- have you ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I'm interested in the in the shortwave aspect of it how do you find that the the coverage from other places in the world compares with the American coverage of how do you think that the viewpoints differ Uh-huh Uh-huh Do you think then that the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts Uh-huh Which which approach do you find to be more useful the the interpretive approach or the straight reporting Uh-huh Uh-huh One of the things that I found interesting last year during the the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against Peter Arnett who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting some of the things that were available there was a there was a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory and while he was being severely censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that th- you know this isn't a baby milk factory how could he say it was I I think that that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having the not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them
