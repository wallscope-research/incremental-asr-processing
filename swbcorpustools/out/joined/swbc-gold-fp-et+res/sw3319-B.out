Well yes I am as a matter of fact Not a good one but I am a golfer I haven't been out all year I didn't get out this year but I enjoy both watching it and playing it Yes and the the peacefulness And the little critters that are around That's right and it's such a personal challenge More than competitiveness against someone else It's it's a competitiveness against yourself Well you'll Or you'll hear thirty and think boy I got my game together I've had a par and a birdie and a bogey and then you quadruple bogey Being down there do you get to see like the colonial or any of those Oh You really should go at least once You know we've had the P G A up here a- and in Tulsa and I've been to both of them and it's it is so much fun to see these players you see on T V to and to hear that ball go whizzing by it's it's like a bullet going by And you know to to see their concentration and yet to see them how friendly they are when they're walk by you you know and how good they are to their spectators Both Yes Yes it is The scrambles are fun I belong to the country club there in El Reno when I lived there and it you know it it's fun because it's so uncompetitive You really on those you really go out for fun And you know you won't you know you're stroke is just one of one or two or three or four you know that's going to make any difference That's right I used to when I worked at Kerr McGee I used to play in their tournaments And now that was very competitive And I enjoyed it tremendously but I I'm more I think I get more enjoyment just couple friends going out And if if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green so be it You know we just think well the next time has got to be better yes every hole Does your club have a good woman's association It's hard to be a weekend golfer and improve your game It it's it's a it's a good game I I wish I had more time to play and I felt you know had more energy to play it too
