No I've only been here a couple of years but I've I've noticed that this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past Yeah yeah well I remember last year we had ice and snow terrible ice storm around this time of the year And this year it's been so hot and sunny it it's really quite quite amazing Uh-huh Yes I was just talking to my son today he's up in Boston and it was twenty-nine there and it was you know in the seventies out here and it was really he really wished he could be here rather than there really Uh-huh uh-huh I have you know I I don- I think it's really been delightful I come I've spent most of my time in in warm weather areas and the ice and snow just doesn't hold any allure for me at all Her- do you you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas Uh-huh You must well it must be quite a bit hotter down there isn't it wow yes yeah it's terrible Orlando is the only place I've ever been where I've seen the car sweat that's really bad Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah wow I know I I tend to I tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate it doesn't some people say they they like to watch the changing of the seasons but I'd rather you know like southern California you know have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time So it's kind of a luxury Yeah well I guess this the weather isn't as lively a topic as as some of the others we might have gotten I guess we're supposed to say good-bye or something and think about what my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye We messed up the conversation anyway Yeah I know weather's just not all that inspiring Okay well it's nice talking to you Bye-bye
