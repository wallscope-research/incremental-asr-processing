I don't know I've got mixed feelings about the topic No Okay Well Well I don't believe in drugs or alcohol but if you'll remember when the teachers had to take the T CAT they were talking about drug testing us and we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine and we found it belittling Yeah That's true But then you know at the same token I'm not against because I look at airline pilots bus drivers you know people that really have other peoples' lives in their hands truck drivers it's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol And You know in those areas I really you know do believe that maybe we should clean up our you know house Yeah I think it's just like anything else a new concept you know as I said if I have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen I was insulted But at the same token in education we can't do drug random drug testing on kids you know their rights are protected What well but why if you're going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids when we see them and they're you know under the influence That's true It's three minutes and the clicker comes in when it's time to Yeah No Well do we agree or unless it's not me You know here we go again yeah you know I believe that truck drivers and people that have even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands and if they come in stoned or they come in drunk and there was an incident in my children's high school where a teacher stayed drunk Uh-huh And he well no you know we are as susceptible a society as anybody else and Yeah well did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation It was on the news tonight Yeah Then I think you know if if it came push came to shove I'd probably be drug tested you know because it does you know Yeah because you know as I say I'm sitting there fussing and fussing and yet I know of you know one teacher who was an alcoholic in school as well as you know I presume out Uh-huh And you know my children brought it to my attention I never was there to see it Uh-huh And that's not giving a good example to students
