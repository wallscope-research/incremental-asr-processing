I can start I I think one of the the biggest improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into management and you're seeing them get elected to political offices not near enough I know there's still a long way to go especially in top management You're not seeing you know looking at T I you see them in management but you're not seeing them up there as V Ps And I have a sister that's an attorney in Oklahoma City and I know the company that she was with the women didn't h- have near the positions the levels that the men attorneys had And were not given the same respect Yes Uh-huh uh-huh Right right Right I also think that women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be Used to be people would say do you work and you'd say no I work in the home and it was it was then it was almost like a put down particularly particularly even by women in the work force But I think now I think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very very important And it's getting the respect and which is about time Yes very definitely That's right Right Yes And and to those that have never worked and had you know and have stayed home with the kids kind of does your heart good Because I know I stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine were in high school And so you know it it kind of does me good I think also one of the things that that's really tremendous and it doesn't necessarily have to do with women but the fact that the fathers are so involved with families Which again I think it helps a woman's role You know Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I had to course I work full time but my daughter and her husband were out of town so I had my grandchildren for four days during football soccer season and so I would work and her some friends would take care of the kids but I would have to get them picked up from there get them fed get them to practices get homework done get baths I was absolutely exhausted And and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties or early forties to have their first children I think are absolutely crazy Uh-huh
