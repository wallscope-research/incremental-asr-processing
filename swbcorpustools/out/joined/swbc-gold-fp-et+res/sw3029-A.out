Okay well I'll start off being controversial I'm in favor of it Well it seems to be in the current situations but I still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime Particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now Okay Yeah I think definitely Any any crimes against person I feel there should be more than a slap on the hand and being sent to prison and being released in two or three years yeah That's a I don't see a thing wrong with that I believe that Well it's just an an example I think there's someone that's on trial right now here in the Dallas area and they were interviewing the the a young lady was killed sometime back a young girl A personal trial and the reporter was asking a stup- stupid question of the people outside Shouldn't the continued statement end after "A personal trial" and a new slash unit begin  Well how do you feel about this And you know how do they feel about it I'm sure that they want it over with Seems that a slash should be placed after "feel about it"  and they want the person punished and punished properly Yes Yeah Well I feel like the the cost of s- someone who's quoting figures made the cost at like thirty thousand dollars a year to keep someone in prison And well the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases There are more and more instances being on the news or this individual was out on the streets on probation or parole and killed someone else Or seriously injured someone Yeah Yes Yes indeed <> Yeah Yeah No Here again anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind the opportunity exists for someone to get killed Now I'm not in favor of gun control to the degree or anything because there are uses for guns which are noncriminal but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them aside from domestic disputes husbands shooting wives or vice versa But these individuals if they have a gun with them I think that the the sentence should be even longer than if they don't Well Well but here again if a matter of expediency part of these costs like the people on Death Row is that their appeals can take years and years There should be some I know there's a law I believe that it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence Well I think that automatic appeal ought to take place within a reasonable length of time say six months/ And a decision be made and not drag out in the courts for years because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities there might be Right there's got to be a there's got to be a time limit A a legit legitimate appeal not a technicality of if and they're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime They're arguing over well were his civil rights violated because someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time Those are the things that have caused them to drag out I think Yeah He didn't see his lawyer as quickly as he should have or some some Mickey Mouse type thing like that yes Yes No I'm not a lawyer I I'm an accountant and I agree We practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers to a degree <> There you go Well it's it's a case that we have a a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself So that's how we get caught in this sort of a catch twenty-two But you have to continue to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty Yeah Yes It does most people Again one of our one of our problems is that our legislature and the state and our national congress the majority of the members thereof are lawyers
