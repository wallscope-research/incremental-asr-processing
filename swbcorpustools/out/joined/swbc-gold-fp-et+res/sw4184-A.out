You have any pets Yeah Two dogs what kind Schnauzers Is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer I'm going into all this because I used to w- I just got done working at a pet shop actually Yeah  Yeah yeah That's good They say Didn't expect that would happen Yeah that's cool that's nice let's see what was the other dog you had a sheltie Yeah They can be nippy Yeah shelties are nice Everybody seems to be really happy with them They're good temperament They put up with a lot Schnauzers in particular probably yeah Yeah I g- it seems the smaller the are the the worse off they are Yeah the- they're bred down so much It's They aren't the best pets Yeah Yeah some people seem fairly well suited for for miniature poodles and such Pit bull They might they're actually very friendly dogs they're really nice I I've dealt with quite a few of them People customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like they fit collars and stuff on them and they are they are just really nice really friendly kind of like medium intelligence Well because some people want to train them as Yeah You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way Yeah it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond Right Yeah they aren't they aren't by nature really nasty critters They are very determined critters and so once you get them going it's not good to to deal with but they I I really like them two utts I was I was impressed by them They're they're real sturdy little critters and they aren't that big And just really friendly I was I was overwhelmed Yeah Yeah right now They picked up a lot of bad press lately Well yeah But any any any pet's going to can can be bad if you train it to be that way Well yeah it's when in my hometown they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret attacking a k- a child in a house these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret The the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild and you know they should expect something like that to happen And so bas- now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town Yeah it it bit him And that was that was not a good thing but I think it was probably a an individual ferret thing because it was f- it was a fairly wild ferret Hadn't they hadn't Yeah they really should have should have expected it And taken the precautions They didn't It's too bad it happened though Right
