Hey that sounds like a great deal to me You have great aspirations Well let's see I we just bought a seventy-three Mercedes that we have restored and it Yeah it has really been a lot of fun we found some guys that actually you know worked for a Mercedes dealership and they also repair them for other the people on their off time so have we we have redone that thing from stem to stern inside outside you know we've redone the body repainted it detailed it so you know I really haven't thought much past that it seems like you know I don't know if I'll ever want another new car again you know Maybe not Yeah that's true I I don't know it just seems like you know for what we've put into it I feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more than you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right we the one thing that we did decide as it's it's we wanted it to be as authentic as possible but we did break down and put a C D player in it that's not quite authentic but at any rate that that was one thing that I one of the features that I did want I'd passed up on one and put a sunroof in it I had to stop there Yeah well of course we do it ourselves but like I said we were just lucky to find these guys that do it you know they're they just weren't really expensive and yeah you know right and they work on it so the things that can be done here they just come here to our home and and work on it or work on it so yeah it's you know it's really it's really been nice We Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah You're an American car person Yeah yeah I I have always had an American American car and I had a real real bad experience with the Cougar that I had it was an eighty-two Cougar and I don't know I think it just soured me on it for some reason because I had trouble with it starting the engine blew up in it I had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so you know I I thought what the heck you know we'll try something different so Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Really Yeah right yeah Yeah I would that that there's I see a marked improvement you know as far as what I've heard about performance and such you know so hopefully it'll stay that way you know I'd I'd I would hate to see the American car industry suffering more than it already has you know even though right now I'm not driving an American car but I think Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah Yeah yeah Uh-huh Yeah twenty thousand yeah yeah Well that's what my parents are avid Cadillac freaks They had and I think my my mother drives the SeVille now that's I guess it's a couple of years old and she had a SeVille before that that had the odd backs that was that was so yeah yeah and she it final just wore out they had they had purchased it I don't can't remember how many years they had that car but she loved the styling of it No she sold it and she Yeah I know Yeah she kept telling herself that and it's sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because my dad said well just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it he came back with a new car Yeah I think he had an ulterior motive he could just see you know dollar signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went but they they really are nice cars there there Yeah Uh-huh Yeah yeah Yeah it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again you know they had they've scaled everything down so much and I have I don't I've never owned a really large car I don't know I think that Cougar was the biggest thing I ever had and Yeah now the Lexus are very nice looking cars you know Uh-huh That's true that's true Yeah Yeah What is what yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah yeah Yeah I know that I've I've sort of always felt like with Buicks it seems like all Buicks to me look alike you know I guess it just it seems to me they're all the same shape I have a very good friend that has a Buick Regal and she she's had she's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it and that's what she's going to buy again and I'm like please it looks exactly the same as this old one that you've got and so I guess it's in the eyes of the beholder I suppose Really Uh-huh uh-huh Are they still are what they're what they have out for like the next year is everything still pretty square it seems like the Cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really I I can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the Alliance Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Now when when was this was this recently okay because I have Yeah usually when I see the new cars it's during the fair when I go to the auto building at the State Fair and that's usually when I see anything you know I see Yeah really Uh-huh my word That's wild you know you hear about things like that and you think that can't possibly be done it just that's just too weird Uh-huh Right uh-huh so you could tell see the inside of them or whatever Yeah Yeah yeah well maybe somebody's finally woken up you know Yeah Yeah yeah you know if I could fine spelling "find"  I I was really crazy about Jags for a while and the convertible had a is it X J S or something like that and I you know thought that's a dream car and and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant you know Yeah yeah Well that's good that you can really that gosh that's great I think it takes a talent to do that you know my my husband is engineer but he cannot or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it that's might be part of it but you know we just I just say forget it we'll just take it in and get it taken care it He drives drives a Honda Uh-huh Right Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well that's to that's one thing that when you would consider see when I go out to think about a new car or buy another car I don't think about well is this engine that I can work on or that you know my husband can work on or whatever you know so you're you're pretty lucky in that respect that Yeah That's when you know yeah Uh-huh That's pretty good it's really been funny because we have like been you are own contractors kind of with this car and when I say we have redone everything I mean we have done everything and it's it's really been so interesting the people you meet because my husband Carl has called all over the country you know he's gotten these catalogs try- it's really more difficult to find these vintage parts when you might think this is for a seventy-three
