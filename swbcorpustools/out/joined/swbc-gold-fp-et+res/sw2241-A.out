Okay what do you do this weekend Which is wh- d- what do you plan have planned for your yard Uh-huh  What part of the state do you live in okay Okay My wife and I we live in Dallas too so Yeah just what that area we're planning on moving to Flower Mound and we're going to be getting some wheel h- we're going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there Seems like it the place we've been living at it's we're we're just leasing it The in Plano and the soil has so much has such a high clay content that I went to use my dad-in-law's tiller and it about for my arms off sockets just just scratching two or three inches was just a chore It was it was and then when it gets wet you know you don't even want to get out in the yard it's horrible It's a nightmare But I don't know what what i- where you live is there a real high alkaline or ash content or Yeah yeah I know right where that's at Uh-huh Really Golly Is it is it limestone under underneath How do you put trees in there  Oh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah yeah we we tried planting tomatoes last year and it they they turned out pretty poor I just I wi- I just wish I'd known the the variety and everything But it it's amazing we also have roses and they just grow so beautifully Like what what type roses hybrid teas Yeah we we have a few of the real short stem They're kin- they're kind of like the bush roses But I don't know I think it's I think it only has about five or six more years to go because it's a it's a really old bush and but I I I'm amazed because the sun is so intense and the roses just seem to survive just fine there Uh-huh  Yeah Have you have you done done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not Yeah Yeah just if you want a lot of you know light for underneath that may be the all right because we had because we have some we have some old fruit trees We have a plum that's just about ready to go so we may just be getting rid of that but but our peaches they they seem to be doing just fine but they they really need pruning It just seems like they that that even you know pruning once a year is really not enough but the the way they behave I don't know But but what kind of what kind of what kind of grass are you growing Bermuda Yeah I've I've been trying a mixture of the bermuda and the rye but I may be working like a fescue in because of you know the type of weather It seems that bermuda's bermuda's fine but it looks like it would hold the soil but it really doesn't A lot of a lot silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well But but the rye does really well Especially during the wintertime But but boy once it gets over seventy seventy-five degrees that it just dries up shrivels up and dies But anyway Yeah My my parents-in-law they're they're building a house into the side of a hill well it's already been built and everything They've been living there for about three months now but this is out in west Texas but the the wind there has been so bad that they've tried to plant grass and they just have some problems big time problems they just so they just washing watching their lawn just blow away But it's it's quite an undertaking They have about two or three acres of land on lake front property on a on the side of a hill It's beautiful you can see the house from you know miles away but it's you know it's a pretty neat little job but they save a lot of they save a lot of energy but just you know for them they they're going to have to start gardening It's going to be from the ground up The whole way And they said well we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just getting this property developed It's amazing they have have the all they have are me- mesquite and cottonwoods and it's it's all on Lake Greenbelt that property out there And I don't know that what they have they have all the water they want they can they can actually they can pump water they have to get permission but they can pump water up from the shore but that's for like an additional they have to pay like some kind of fee per year But they're right now though I think they're just they're trying to get the trees planted and everything But man I I just think of all of the money that they that they're going to have to spend just getting that But the taxes alone there Lake Greenbelt and some places they they they really nail them for tax And your talking what just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes It's it's ridiculous Yeah No no it's not it's because even though it's far out there it's just that Lake Greenbelt you know they have to they they try to do it just from the selling the water But the water usage you know they try to limit even though there's three or four streams that flow into it people still use it enough in like in towns like Clarendon and other areas that where they irrigate They they they still haven't gotten used to the dry land farming but the ir- irrigation because it's gotten so bad the past few years but I don't know I just came back from there and just the air is so dry I don't see how anything can survive out there for long periods of time Should say my father-in-law says the mesquite trees are they're they're pretty smart they're smart they're about the smartest tree around They don't they don't even start growing until May May or April like after it's been raining for a few months They say the roots have developed so that's all they work on Just a leafy they don't do anything Uh-huh I I don't know my my wife and I we planted on the on the south side of our of our house we planted some gardenias And they did real fine during the summertime it's just but during the fall when it stopped when the rain let off just a little bit it it just dried up And so I guess it these plants they just they don't it's like they remain
