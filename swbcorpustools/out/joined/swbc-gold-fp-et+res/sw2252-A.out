Well what is your view do you consider the Soviet Union a threat Sure Right It's it's hard to to know anymore if it's a a threat one way or another because it used to be s- so f- much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell you know rank and file in behind it And now that with Gorbachev is introducing more I guess freedoms expressions of freedom it doesn't look as though you know everybody's following the same pattern And those the people who are you know the staunch military conservative people you never know well Gorbachev's future is like whereas whereas in the past it was seen as you know whoever was the head of the the communist party was seen as you know untouchable Uh-huh Exactly Right Right Well it's amazing just because of the drain that's been on you know both economies that our economy is of course been able to withstand that a little better but the Russian economy they you know they I don't know what the percentages are but I heard it one time it's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine And finally you know who knows maybe they're finally waking up and saying you know we can't afford this the U S isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be you know even if they're saying that beneath the doors But it's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period Even if it is you know the best thing in the long run it just steps on too many people's toes who are comfortable with the way the situation is Uh-huh Right Expend Uh-huh Well it's interesting anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism philosophy that that was here in you know twenty years ago but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do on- have cor- have not been world powers So it's easier for us to say you know to an Iraq you know you can't do this get back you know or we're going to force you Whereas you know if the Soviet Union would have who knows what taking over Mongolia or or something like that who is really will we have been more just rhetoric rather than going in there officially or you know physically and try to to remove them Uh-huh Exactly Yeah that personally I don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat and I think he's actually honestly trying to do some change But I don't believe that he in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah that was always kind of interesting people you know a lot of my friends have a taken us down the stance of you know these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away and I'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic you know if I'm a Soviet and if part of you know south let's say South Dakota wanted to succ- you know succeed am I going to stand for that Now I realize that the origins are are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with and that they may have been forced I'm not that familiar with their future but I you know I it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than a volunteer or willingness to join But Uh-huh Uh-huh And then just never given back Yep Well that whole a the whole i- idea if you look at the Russian history and I guess all countries the way it used to be is the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer And that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers and maybe you know more and more people are seeing countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isn't going to help you you can well I guess like with Israel is a perfect example The reason they have the Angolan Heights and the the all their buffer area is between Jordan and the the Sinai and and Lebanon was just as a buffer but you know as you can see with the the scuds go right over there Yeah there's there's very little that that binds you anymore in today's technology That's probably very true Ve- that's very interesting never thought of that Uh-huh Nobody knows what to do Is it real Uh-huh Right Exactly I get confused between all the which is the Soviet provinces versus which are the the Russian provinces versus what are Uh-huh Right as a as a vote Sure Sure Died down on that I thought it was interesting that recently here the Warsaw Pact no longer exists as a militor- military force but it's merely an economic now Well at Yeah exactly Uh-huh Exactly and and all the Well that's what they're saying the whole problem you know with if we were to demilitarize Europe what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there What's going to happen to the economies that are no longer have a a million plus people in the indu- you know in each country from the U S
