could could be Huh Yeah we is is crime a problem there like a major problem minor problem or Uh-huh Yeah Yeah yeah Yeah I've only been here for like probably just over six months I start I started school here I came from a smaller town in in New York and cri- the city was fairly big size not real big but we had a problem there but here there's just no comparison that much more crime every night the news is very depressing because it just they run down the list of how many people were shot you know drive by shootings or whatever and it's it it's pretty bad They're they're it's things have basically improved here over the last few years They've they've actually taken steps to try to make it better but it still it still is a problem Well that's that seems to be what they were doing and it has and they've started stepped up more patrols in certain areas and it has has made some places safer but you know it's very difficult if you don't have an infinite amount of money to to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could as it is a it's definitely a problem and you know the more more less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread into smaller areas unfortunately Right Yeah I think I think that it's seems to be that I don't know some people they te- they do something you know they shoot somebody or whatever they go to jail sentenced to jail for like thirty years they're out in five and they're back on the street and then they shoot someone else and just a a cycle <> and it seems seems as though the the system doesn't cha- tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done Yeah It's definitely true It seems seems as though we try to play humanitarian I think to a little to much typo too and maybe some of the people don't deserve the the humanitarian treatment that they get But I don't know It's a difficult situation I think and some something has to be done because I definitely think it's it it really plays reeks havoc with your quality of life when you know you can see it's going on around you but then when once it finally affects you then then it really starts to bother you But it seems people have moved like out of the city because they want to get away from the crime and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out but you know it's only a matter of time before you know it still catches up with them You can't really run away from the problem and something you know something has to be done but just that too many people argue about how to fix it sure Right Right Yeah Yeah that's good Right Yeah Yeah Yeah It's it's to bad because it's th- just even the random occurrences where you know it's unsafe for a woman just to walk from the car to the some in certain areas like from the car from their car to the mall or something and it's dangerous And it's just that's just ridiculous and you know it's just that's just not right Something you know Right right Right Yeah Yeah it's definitely unfortunate
