Uh-huh Well here in Saskatoon much the same thing There is no curb pick up of any of the recycled products we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people there are areas where we could actually we have a couple of the handicapped societies types of places where the one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers so we are able to have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there are there's a deposit program on plastic and glass containers Well primarily soft drink bottles and so we are able to take it to one of the rehabilitation centers and then they recycle the containers They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container and then Right On the on primarily on soft drink pops and that kind of thing and so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler with the handicapped group will also accept those So it's fairly fairly extensive but then again it's it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city Well actually there's there's the opportunity for both Generally the the handicapped group takes care of the things that actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to re- recycle the bottle so that you get your money back and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit and then I and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well yeah I guess partly because of our climate Here in Saskatoon at least the majority of central well I want to say Central Canada but Central Canada tends to referred more to Ontario and Quebec but we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people We certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfa- welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes They have done it some but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers They are actually at virtually all of the shopping centers Like the shopping malls There are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins and then the bins are collected some of the
