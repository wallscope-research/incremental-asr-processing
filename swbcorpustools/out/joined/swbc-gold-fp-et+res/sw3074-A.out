Yes I I think that Plano has really done a fantastic job at least their plans have are good how- however I was maybe you saw in the paper this morning that they've had some problems with the recycling on plastic uh-huh I thought that was most interesting Yeah Yes Yeah That's right Yeah I guess that's going to happen Yeah a really good effort that's right yeah Well I was thinking about the other day when I when Dick and I were many many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in Missouri I went I was probably this was probably see it have been like nineteen sixty-seven or sixty-eight we I went to a meeting and one of the the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling and she was from Saint Louis and she had this fantastic family effort in in recycling and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics and her aluminum and I thought wow how one person is doing that you know but my my thought was it's a shame it's wonderful that she's doing it and it but wouldn't it be mu- much nicer if we all did it because her effort would have really really been a good example for all of us And yet you know and we were just sort of talking about it at the time And here we are you know now we're doing it on a city wide basis in in communities So it's wonderful that we've come that far I think but slash error I think she was I was trying to remember it seems to me that she was doing it on her own and living in Saint Louis there were places where she could actually take her things herself and so it wasn't you know something that was being picked up or and I think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would But I remember her saying yes I have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing and I thought wow that's that is wonderful that somebody does that Yeah Uh-huh Right Yes Sure you do uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Isn't that amazing Well you know Yes People I don't know they find fault in everything rather than say this is a good effort Yeah I don't know It's it's I under- I know what you're saying kind of people like that and slash error Well sure it is ba Yep Yeah it's on down the line Right Yes Yeah I agree When Uh-huh Yeah Sure Yeah Right Yeah Well I know I guess I got a good example from my mother because she was always very very conscientious about recycling things and she is to this day and you know I mean she'll even if she for instance she she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for you know when she made cookies it would go on that or if she needed to wrap something for needed sandwich paper or something she'd use that She just she recycles everything And I have done the same thing I recycle like zip lock bags and things like that My kids get the biggest kick out of that Although they do the same thing they I think they give me a hard time but I think they know that that's it's the right way Uh-huh Yes and they appreciate how much it costs to do that Yeah That's right That's true yeah slash error--two utts Well I don't know you know I I wonder how how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to to make this whole thing work the extra like washing out bottles and jars or the extra of actually making sure that you take stuff over to you know some people are compl- now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked up at the curbside you know and I think golly Moses you just do your part You know people are not you you you can't be waited on all your life and expect things to always ha- work ou- out No that's right Uh-huh Right Yeah yeah Yes Uh-huh Yeah Yeah yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh No slash error Uh-huh Yeah Yeah right do those little things yeah that make a lot of difference uh-huh Yeah Yeah it's I you know and I think you're right though I think that it has to really hit home before the message sometimes Or you have to grow up with it being im- important in your life before the message really takes hold sometimes And I don't know it's it's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things I am than I even myself than I used to be a few years ago like I I'd go to the to the U T D cafeteria for lunch sometimes and they use styrofoam plates when they wouldn't need to use styrofoam plates You know and I think to myself that's that's crazy I wonder if you know maybe I need to bring that to someone's attention you know and and I'm seeing more and more of that and and I think it's just McDonald's effort to reduce the number of of styrofoam boxes that they use for hamburgers and stuff I think is a good good example you know that even industry is willing to do it Yeah Well I think that may that's kind of what it's coming to I'm sure Yeah yeah That's right yeah Uh-huh Wow That doesn't wouldn't surprise me Uh-huh Yeah yeah slash error I know it and unfortunately
