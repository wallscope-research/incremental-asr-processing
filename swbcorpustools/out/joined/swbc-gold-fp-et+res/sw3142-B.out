Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh Do you usually go out with the children or without them Right Yes Yes Yes Well well we don't have any children so we tend to like to try all sorts of different things And we're very attracted to exotic food And we like Indian food and Thai cuisine and sort of gourmet Mexican and things like that as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and Chinese and things and and things of that sort Now yes of course we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that too And we probably go out one to two times a week And we're pretty much regulars at an Italian local Italian restaurant Momo's Uh-huh I've heard about it I haven't been in there Uh-huh Tha- that's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me I I like different kinds of food So when we go out I'm always looking for something other than the standard menu even if it's a Mexican Restaurant like something other than you know the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and fajitas now Yes yes and once in a while things backfire we've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food and things like that And I'm not fond of some of those things but we'll try we'll try anything Ethiopian we've had Ethiopian And not in Plano of course But we really we really do enjoy going out and and I'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally backfires Yeah I think we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or or what attracts us to a restaurant How do you usually find a a new restaurant Uh-huh So do we Uh-huh Right Uh-huh We have found a number of restaurants either through D and the Friday paper and sometimes the the OBSERVER Which my husband usually picks up And also through coupons When a new restaurant opens up they usually send out coupons And you know when they say you know buy one get one free It's hard to resist so we'll go in And very often we'll find a place that we like and we'll stick with it once they give they no longer give coupons We'll we'll we'll stay there But we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons and the other half through the through the newspaper reviews it's wonderful particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that It's very expensive to go out to eat So yeah that that is really one of our it's almost a hobby with us Yes Yes Yeah Uh-huh absolutely And do the dishes yes M- m- m- my sister who also lives here in Dallas tends to chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty but What's your favorite restaurant Uh-huh Sure You know we've never been there And that's supposed to be wonderful  Uh-huh Ooh Uh-huh I would probably like that One or two times in my life I've ever had venison I've loved it But you know just it's just not I don't know people who hunt so  That's that's supposed to be a wonderful place W- here in Plano well we tend to go to Momo's a l- fairly often And sometimes we'll go you know we we also go to Chili's and Colter's Bar B Q and and we go to lil- there is a little Thai place that's over on Park that we go to My husband particularly likes that We go into Dallas a lot and because we're both were from the Richardson North Dallas area up until fairly recently And we'll go down to Blue Mesa Grill Mexican food and
