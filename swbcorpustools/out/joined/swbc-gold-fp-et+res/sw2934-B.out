Okay How's the weather been out there Uh-huh <> It's pretty normal for this year you know they have tornados about once a week and it rains about every three days The last two years before they've had record rainfall By this time of the year they'd had enough rainfall for the whole year but this time we're only I think maybe five inches ahead of of normal So it's not been bad at all I'm from Texas Uh-huh And they had some flooding in Houston the other day real real bad over I think it was over the weekend The radar just looked nasty with a bunch of red splotches all across it <> Yeah that's that's right There y- Uh-huh so you get a lot more rain that way Uh-huh <> Brings in that cold air and mixes it with the with the warm air coming off the Atlantic Ocean That's what Uh-huh Is the temperature like sixty- sixties to eighties there too or do you get east winds a lot of the time from the ocean or Uh-huh Uh-huh That's the way it does here most of the time But sometimes it just comes straight from the north and then it and then it doesn't veer off to the east until you get down to Houston or or maybe mid mid-Texas depends on how strong the cold fronts are well Richardson's a suburb of Dallas Hardly ever unless there's a hurricane or something like that Well it's kind of early f- I was going to say the weather man on on one of our stations was talking about the way that the weather's doing now is like tropical weather and he was afraid if it kept doing that that they'd have er- early hurricanes this year Yeah Kind of wiped them ou- Uh-huh Wiped everything out Yeah Uh-huh Do y- do you get many tornados this time of year or   Right Uh-huh And the you you aren't in the mountains or anything like that are you There's just hil- there's just hills Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah they they had a lot of them They had a a huge one that was on INSIDE EDITION the other night in the southern part of Kansas they took a bunch of film of it It kind of chased them It was a few hundred yards away and it chased them under an underpass and it was tossing around the car right before it got there and it tore up the people inside the car And the n- the camera man on the news crew held the camera out they were hiding underneath the underpass and he held the camera out as the tornado went by And y- the + the wind you know it had a mike on it and the wind and everything was incredible I'm surprised they didn't they because we saw it on the news a couple of days in a row and that and you know and that was way up in Kansas But over here it's a lot it's a big thing about tornados and people that get pictures of them Yeah you can really see them well there Yeah It's really strange the way it does that Especially the way it starts It starts you know just like a little swirl in the clouds and and then it just grows from there And it and and usually it's not even raining when it starts It's just Uh-huh That's right and they're black and sometimes they're even green colored yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah that's it Wow <> And that's about that's what we get this time of year just all the way sometimes all the way through June the last especially the last two years it's rained what I think it rained nine inches in in one one of the Junes the last two years And this year u- we usually get about five inches in May and it's it's over that Uh-huh <> All right well I hope you have good weather the rest of the summer Have fun playing tennis Bye-bye
