Well it's kind of a broad subject I I think there are some areas where we where we pretty well you know get our money's worth but I I also think there are a lot of areas especially in big government federal government where we're short changed lot of money spent for things that are not used and I was I was in the Air Force and I was at there were there was equipment at every base I was ever on that was just going to waste It was just sitting and rusting and you know and Yeah Yeah Yeah and I I think that it's a a tone of our times that politicians are into themselves more than they are into you know doing something worthwhile for the people they represent which is really unfortunate Yeah Uh-huh And don't really respond to people who write them and call them and you know unless they're in the limelight and under pressure So yeah I think we get short changed on that Texas That's Well I work for school district and it's it has hurt us a lot there has to be some way I think to equalize education opportunities But you know our we we tend to think I think e- especially big government tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it And I don't you know that's just not true I don't think the you know I don't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or problem solving skills I think there are there are too many things  that money can't that that money can't buy that that are important as far as education is concerned Richardson Oh Great okay Yeah Yeah I think we've Yeah we have got it on the line don't we And it's not going to get any better D- you know it's going up and up and up I used to live in the Plano school district and there was a an organization a taxpayers organization that finally communicated the message to the I think to the people in Plano that you know we didn't want our taxes raised Yeah But this you know this I think living in Richardson we're kind of spoiled because I think we get we come closer to getting our money's worth as far as the city is concerned I think than probably any any city in the country Is that incredible That's that's the biggest mess I've ever heard of You know how can you how can you justify raising anybody's salary if you you know if you have to lay people off Yeah Yeah Well yeah I think the teachers d- did and I don't know about administrators I I'm semiretired and I was I was an administrator so I you know I don't get a raise anymore I just I I work part-time and just get you know my pay doesn't change Yes Yes very much course I I still work two part-time jobs So it's not really total retirement
