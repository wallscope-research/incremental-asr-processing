being a former drug user I I I guess I have to say at this point that I do approve of it because I know that in using drugs I was not a good employee And so I can see from the company's standpoint that there whenever you are an employee of the company you are using it's assets and b- you are also under their liability under the Workmen's Comp on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases and I work for a tire company Modern Tire And it's also a retreading plant and that's where most of our injuries occur And what we do is we'll have a drug test if an if a a break or a man has an accident Then he's automatically given a drug test Yes when he goes to the doctor the first time And so that kind of I don't know if it's been a deterrent or not because we have just started using it for the past year or so Now we've let some people go that wa- we was found that drugs were used in their system Now I don't know how T E C would handle it They haven't pursued it you know if there's some problem I know there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines and he went to a a separate drug testing firm and they showed it negative So I think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried you know Uh-huh really And then I also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine And he tested positive on cocaine Now then you always wonder well is he just saying that Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah because you're endangering everybody's lives if you if it's something like that Uh-huh You're kidding The executives right The executives Yeah Wouldn't that be awful if you were if you were using and and lose your job and everything I can't believe I was so <> brazen before I like I say I'm a former drug user but I I well I I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior and so I don't use drugs any more marijuana cocaine and amphetamines yes uh-huh And all on the job too You know it had gotten that bad Really it's it's life is so much more enjoyable Uh-huh And I was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know you know there's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing Uh-huh that's right Yeah That's right Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh goodness Yeah Yeah my gosh Yeah Uh-huh Right I would think there would be But they weren't Isn't that awful Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah  Yeah That reminds me of I have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time and I have just casually asked her what he did for a living And she said he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff And I just you know went where Let me move as far away as possible Yeah But I'm proud though that that you know I grew up in the sixties and back then it was popular you know but people have really wizened you know become wise about drugs and they really have a good campaign for the young people you know They know it's not smart so So I guess it was just a generational thing That's right and that's good That's the best way to stop it Yeah well I think we did it So it's good talking to you Yeah bye-bye
