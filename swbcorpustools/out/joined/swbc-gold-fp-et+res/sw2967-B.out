well I have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES which is probably the the best movie that I have seen lately I do not go out to films very often So as far as out of the house So we do get a lot of videos that we bring in and I see some that way But I am not real current on films How about you I hear that is really good but I have not seen it yet Yeah Uh-huh cute dear Uh-huh  and he hears them or something and Who wins great great Yeah I had heard people talk about it and they say it was really cute but I had not seen it we usually wait and ev- eventually it comes out on video and then we get it and see it that way And that is it movies are very expensive movie theatres here they are six dollars for evening performances And that is kind of steep I think I don't know How much is it in Dallas Yeah You can do that but it is difficult if you if you work or you know that is taking the middle of the afternoon And if I am looking for entertainment usually I I have more time in the evening than I do in the middle of the day to see things What do you think of movies in general As far as the as the trends Uh-huh Yeah Did Yeah The quality I think maybe has improved in that respect the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a a tougher rating Which suggests that that you know it will be more enticing to the to the public And a lot of times it is added for no real valid reason which does not make and I think SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT was a little bit like that but DANCES WITH WOLVES did not seem to have anything added It was just all legitimate kind of film And that is where reason why I suppose it won so many Oscars because it really was good even though it is such a long movie You know they said "Oh people won't won't be interested in a three hour movie" But it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone yeah Absolutely but much more true to life and I think that is that is the point they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good I hate sequels too I hate these you know number one two three four Usually if a movie is good once is enough Right That was on Prime Time Television here recently at seven thirty in the evening And it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie And children young children could see could have seen that movie at that hour And I thought that you know that would not have been the sort of thing I would have wanted my children to see at that age when they were young And here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the T V which was a it was a good movie it was well done but that is one reason why it was scary So but I do not know that I have seen any of the sequels to that I think one is enough <> Yes uh-huh That is what people say Oh Yeah It just a touch Well the whole movie is kind of far fetched But the whole idea behind it is far fetched Not not too often That has gotten to be a whole camp i- idea now though you know If you hear that music you know everybody knows what you are talking about It's funny Well it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs Yeah Uh-huh Right Yeah I saw it then too Yeah It was good It was very good But see I have teenagers in my house And of course sometimes they rent movies and you know have friends over or something And sometimes movies are here that I did not I am not even aware that I could have seen you know Because my family tells me that that that it had been actually in the house before But I had missed it But I did see it on T V and I thought it was good really Uh-huh No kidding I did not realize that Yeah you know the character that James Earle Jones played I teach in school and we are doing a book called INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison And I wondered if maybe he was patterned after him I do not know I had not heard anybody talk about it But he certainly could have been which was kind of interesting You know someone who who was a real activist but then took up the cause kind of gave up you know because he did not think anything was happening and so it was kind of fun I do not know for sure but there are certain qualities that suggest it could be he Because they were they were suggesting that this Ben was something of a recluse That he had stopped writing and had stopped you know and that is true for Ellison He he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it has pretty much dropped out of public life But he is still alive and that you know that is what makes it so interesting And that book have you ever read that book INVISIBLE MAN INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison It is an incredible book It really is very very interesting I highly recommend it the yeah the movie the in FIELD FIELD OF DREAMS came out after that novel So i- it could easily have been patterned after him But the the movie did not have anything to do with with the story that I am talking about But I just thought the act- the author could have been patterned after that th- that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him certainly Sort of interesting so Well I guess we have talked probably our l- time limit haven't we Okay Very good It was nice talking to you Okay Bye-bye
