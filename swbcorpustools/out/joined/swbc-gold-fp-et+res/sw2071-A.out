Okay Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy <> Yeah you do want a lot of that stuff What kind of things are you going to consider you know what you said something about the about the well what do you call them you said amenities that they have but what about their reputation of the company or the price It is for me other people don't seem to have the same problem Yeah Yeah Well the last car we bought was American because of because of that reason but have not been entirely happy with several things about the car it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as I expected it to be Because several things minor things sort of but still they cost us money that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay on a car that that was that new you know we bought the car new and after well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch And they just said well you know clutches are disposable and I said since when Brake pads are disposable you know we know that but I never thought a clutch was disposable/ Yeah so that was that was kind of a shock Yeah you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like like a Mercedes Benz they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable You would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes especially not after two years Really I don't know Uh-huh Yeah What kind of what brand of car are you thinking about buying or like what things are you looking at Uh-huh How come I've been kind of I guess the commercials are getting to me the Toyota commercials and I know that a lot of people I've I've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them that hardly had any problems at all I think they have a really good quality/ Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah They seem to be really durable So I don't know I'm I'm not ready to buy a new car yet but I don't know if if the next time I'm going to try to to stay with buying something American or if I'm going to go for a little more what I would consider to be a long-term investment it's easy to get gas mileage in this car/ it gets excellent gas mileage Uh-huh I think so All righty thanks <> Bye-bye
