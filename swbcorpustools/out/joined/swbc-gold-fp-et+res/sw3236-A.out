Why don't you go ahead and say what you feel and then I'll respond Yeah Well how long have you been here Well Yeah Yeah I think that's a good excuse You need to get into the the system a little more and know where to take things We've been here probably two and a half years and and we didn't recycle at all before we came so I think we're doing well We we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now Well the glass and the newspaper we usually take to Walmart They have in behind Walmart they have bins and then we usually save up our cans and and change them in for money Uh-huh there's a place on Parker Road it's just over the overpass before you get like to K-Mart I think there's a a service station there There's usually a semi truck that has a a person there that will weigh them and Now they aren't worth much right now but it's better than nothing so and what I hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the the pickup now and we hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of October Yeah and I think it's been delayed I think it was originally scheduled for February but the trucks that were supposed to do it there's been some problems with from what I've read in you know the mail that we get and I can't wait for that that will be easy I get tired of newspaper littering the garage I feel guilty we don't recycle our our milk containers because they seem like a big waste Yeah yeah they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can so I'll be glad when the bins do come and I think that's when I'll I'll start doing the plastic too Yeah I've gotten used to washing the you know the salad dressing bottles and things like that it's not that big of a deal and it's nicer to just throw them out but we can do our part take an extra minute or two when we first were were here it was like we'd take maybe a a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full and it would be like two dollars but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar Yeah which is understandable I think more people are are recycling That's something we we don't really make any effort to and whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter you know the the cans and that was kind of fun but we haven't done that for a long time so Well the boys think it's fun plus you get your exercise and you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest so but Well hopefully the bins will be here in this month and that will spur you on so All right well it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting Trying that's all you can do so yeah you can do it as long as you want They you know if it's been long enough five minutes is is when they cut in and say say we don't have any more room for recording So we can say good-bye now It was good talking to you and maybe we'll get on line again Thanks Sherry Bye-bye
