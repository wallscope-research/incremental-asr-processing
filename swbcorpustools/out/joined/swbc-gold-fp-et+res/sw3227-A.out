Okay well I I was thinking about it for a long time and I like basically almost every form of music and type of music I don't have a whole lot of dislikes I like jazz especially the blues and I like a lot of the of course the classics everything back from Bach and and Beethoven and Chopin and just in general everything I enjoy a lot of the the modern forms Right right well that gets some of the punk when I was in high school that was one of the big things was punk music and a lot of it is has a lot to say some of it has a lot to say the music does the lyrics do but the the actual well it it's it's it really expresses some of the opinions of of the people who enjoy the music but as far as a musical art form I just don't see a whole lot of art to it  some of it it depends I like the rap the two types of rap I like I enjoy to listen to and one is the the rap that is just funny and they usually do a lot of satire  Right Right the monotonous the monotonous no that's not I don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about well I'm better than you and blah blah blah I don't like that I like the funny satire and then some of it is some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our in urban society It really does It talks about race relations and police relations and that that Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that's that's about my opinion of that It's it's okay The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is is doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it the one country and western song sounds like every other country and western and so the the musicians don't get to really get into their music They just play a certain number of chords the drummer plays a certain beat and you have a country and western song and Right Yeah And I can't say that I like a lot of the modern the very very modern rock and roll but I I definitely I really enjoy the fifties the sixties and a lot some of the seventies rock and roll and I really enjoy especially the sixties
