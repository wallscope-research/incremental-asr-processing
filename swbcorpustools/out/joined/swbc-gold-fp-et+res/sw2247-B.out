A type of work station Is it a two eighty-six or three eighty-six base machine It's eighty eighty-eight Okay <> what type of utilizations do you make of it Word processing obviously Okay I use them both here at work and at home And I have I B M clones in both cases Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eighty-six base mach- machine Yes it is unfortunately I need all of it for example I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size And that I know that brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to it's knees because I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty-six machine and it brought it to it's knees Just in the ability to handle And then I have a three eighty-six F X a sixteen bit machine at home And I'm really pleased with it It manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and databases database searches what I've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them Have you To try to make them more effective and useful Have you been struggling along those lines Well I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it It's I used it on some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it It was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it The at least the version I had tended to keep copies of that Of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of all of a sudden you got a disc full error Not a fun thing to try to recover from Very frustrating but again I've been dealing with large files both data and and otherwise that was a engineering spec on B two You come here with the B level of specs Well it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build to one level down from assistant description Well I sure need them there's no way that I could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that I need to to try to do my job without them Yes maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things I think that's when you you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have When you start seeing what all they can do for you Well I understand that you know if needs and wants were the same I'd have a four eighty-six machine at home Right that's came out around the first of the year It does a few more things than had been available before But I'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement you know once you get passed thirty-three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation Because you no longer can think that fast anyway Well okay I enjoyed our discussion You do the same Bye
