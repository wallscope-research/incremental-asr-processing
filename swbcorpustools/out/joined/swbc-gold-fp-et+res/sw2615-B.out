Yeah I had a similar thing that I've worked on cars ever since I was a kid And that was some time ago but I've gotten to the point where the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that most of the cars I buy I try to buy as simple a car as possible So you know changing the oil changing the spark plugs and most of them now you know you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or or fuel injected so there goes the carburetor and if the fuel injection system breaks down there's no way in the world you're going to work on that yeah yeah basically that's it Yeah I've got an eighty-four Chevy van that's a one ton van with a camper conversion on it It's got the the the good old three fifty standard engine in it Regular gas engine and that engine I understand I can wo- I can actually work on that engine Yeah Uh-huh Right Yeah I had to change the water pump in that here about a year ago And it was really fairly easy Take the grill out and the radiator out and you can just stand there and work on it Well that's true You're right you know by the time you've finally got down to it I was hoping I could remember where all those other things went A few years ago I had an Oldsmobile diesel and the it after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it And I bought it when we were living in Lubbock when I came back here I brought the car back here and I don't know diesels got pretty unpopular and you couldn't sell the thi- though for what you could get for one you might as well drive it over a cliff And the injector pump went bad so I found a outfit down here to rebuild it And i- reinstalled that and that was probably one of the most miserable things I had gotten into in a long time well it you know i- diesels don't require mechanics they require plumbers And Yeah Well the injector nozzle and stuff in you know the big diesel farm tractors you know what are about the size of your thumb and the- yeah you can get to them and the ones in in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with I've had a lot of good service out of that car but I finally gave it to my son and he drove it literally into the ground you know He was out at Tech and he he finished it off What the availability You mean the diesel availability Yeah well I'd bought a G M C diesel pickup and loved that thing you know I really liked it But it turns out a pickup wasn't what I really needed and it was the van that I needed then to buy the you know traded it in on the Chevy van But sure enjoyed it Yeah yeah the three fifty regular gas engine Uh-huh Yeah co- Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I think that little the little Chevy V eight when it started out in sixty in fifty-five I think was two sixty-five something like that Little you know not whole lot more than the than the than the six cylinder that I think was like about two thirty-five or so But they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a four hundred small block four hundred that was the same block you know just just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more an Well that was that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up The two little cars I've got now bought a Mitsubishi Mirage here a couple of years ago and and it was normally carbureted and it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong and you know changing the plugs and stuff Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah The friend of ours over here he's got sixty-five or sixty-six Mustang the six cylinder And I was look under the hood of that the other day and like you say you can see the road It's amazing You coul- yeah you could stand in there if you really wanted to I guess yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Well when they went to the started with the newer engines you know when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much you know trouble Because the three fifty with all the you know like well actually I guess her- within a couple of years ago anyway was the last I've paid any attention to it The three oh five was that that V eight that they put in the the three quarter and and half ton van And it had all the air pump and I don't know all that all that stuff And all the anti-smog stuff And boy that was really a mess back under there under the in that van Uh-huh uh-huh it's that one that's about what an inch and a half wide Got a bunch of groves in it Yeah Yeah Yeah it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck You know when one of them breaks it's not the outside one it's it's the it's usually that power steering be- or something that's way back in there Everything's got to come off Yeah and we'll how many times have you done this now Is this Yeah I hadn't hadn't not gotten any calls here in the last this is the first one in a week or so If ta- it's winding down or what Finding a taker Yeah well Okay all right Bye-bye
