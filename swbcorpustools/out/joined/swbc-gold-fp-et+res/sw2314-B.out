I agree with that People that are driving like truck driver's and things like that I definitely think they should be tested And I'm not I'm not opposed to any testing because I know I certainly wouldn't want to to you know be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or or you know because he was on drugs while he was there  I was tested within my company I think it's kind of a push to weed out drugs in states and because I don't know of any other countries that are doing this and I I feel like it's really just within the United States It's it's okay I think your record should stand for itself That you know if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever then I don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over And once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not I think they could save money by not doing that You know every time say if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place Oh not if it's done fairly And that's probably my question is how how do you know it's done fairly Yeah Well they might tell you it's random But then you know it's kind of like a a lottery Somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything and tries and tries and tries You know I see How'd how did they how do they pick their people Uh-huh I see So do you Right Well do you think that should be implemented in the work place You know as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested Right Right Right right Yeah it it would almost be like a a Uh-huh And then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and you know your supervisor has accused you of using drugs Right I agree with that Because I know personally myself I've been in the same job for three years it will be three years in August and I've already been drug tested three times Well I'm an environmental engineer and I've been drug tested three times and I know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the company I work for is sixty thousand people plus So see I for some reason I've come up three times That's pretty high statistics No No not at all It's a legal job you know so see it's really strange uh-huh Right Well does your the company say for instance does the company you worked for bef- before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey we've already drug tested her and she came up negative Yeah Right right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah And are they tested random They're okay I see Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh I see Uh-huh Okay so they know that And that's Uh-huh Okay Well Yeah I think so Yeah seven twenty-five Okay nice speaking to you Bye
