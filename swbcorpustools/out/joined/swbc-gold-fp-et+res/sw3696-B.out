Hi Yeah this is I'm in Dallas Okay I How big a family do you have Did you have people coming from far away Well sometimes Well you have you have the family lives too close together they see each other too often they don't take that kind of thing seriously And if they come from far away it's it it they take it more seriously and Yeah My family's not very big but we're kind of Well I have a a a brother lives in Indianapolis a sister lives in Chicago and my folks live back in Buffalo New York I guess we have reunions about once a year or so We got together over Christmas My wife's family they're they're all in most of them are in upstate New York They have regular regular family reunions every summer Yeah it is Yeah and it's it's just something that they they plan on doing every summer They just have a weekend picnic and every year everyone asks when is it happening and where is it happening and they just plan on being here Yeah they they had a family reunion for well for my mother-in-law at her seventy-fifth birthday/ and they managed to get just about everybody everybody into town last November including a number of people from out in California So it was a it was good it it worked out very well One in- interesting thing that they did at the time is they they videotaped the the whole shebang which it made a nice remembrance of of the entire party Yeah they want to come back So so that that works pretty well that way Yeah I I can go for that What what do I guess interesting if you had a a a very extended family that that kind of involved a lot of people that cousins and things that you don't really know that you've never met it'd be interesting to meet a lot of those people I don't know how you would go about getting them together but that that would be Yeah I kind of wonder what what kind of tradition we're going to establish for our family I had hoped that our our kids get together at least regularly
