 Basically no Yeah I I the policy that T I has I think is very fair I they first had a policy where they would test new employees and then since I've been with them the last four years there's been in the last year year and a half they're doing random testing of all employees Yes And it is it and fr- from what I understand it is Jerry Junkins all the way down Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I like it because you know I I I grew up in the sixties I graduated high school in sixty-eight and and you know I I saw you know I know my friends who were you know druggies and friends who weren't and and you know it's I think it's a real problem and I think it and I think it's causing us a lot of trouble and and a lot of problems And so I'm hoping that a lot of other companies will will follow the same path probably not Uh-huh Yeah I used to be in D S E G myself A P D as a matter of fact Yep Very aware of it But I I'd I'd I really like the idea in fact I would like to see a lot more people adopt it like you know school systems and that kind of thing I'd like I'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or or who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs Yeah And I like the idea that they have a system where they allow you to be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up Yeah yeah Yeah rather than just put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself That's not going to help anybody get over the problem I believe it is a a a medical problem of course I also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too Yeah so there's a lot of things out there and things that I'm just glad that they decided not to tax drugs otherwise they'd be legal and they'd be getting tax money off it the same way they are the alcohol and tobacco Yeah I have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy and and stuff and I I moved to a T I facility that had never had random drug sampling before because they were outside of the military sector It was an industrial company and you know that T I purchased and so the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it they were really opposed to it and you know there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs and that's why they were opposed to it And it resulted in in a few people leaving you know because they just flat out weren't going to put up with the policy You know they had a life-style and they weren't going to change it And it's Yeah you should have no objection to it it's like going down to get your license and checking your eyes you know why do I need my eyes checked well we want to make sure you can see You know it's like why are we doing this Well so you don't kill people on the road it's a ba- it's the basic premise with you know drug testing Especially some of the jobs luckily I've always been in the engineering sector and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as you know hurting someone it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it But in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor and down in some of those labs and stuff yeah I darn if I'd want somebody down there that I'm working with side by side you know that could kill me by doing something incorrectly because they were not exactly all there because they were on drugs So there's a there's a lot of sectors where I think that would would help out and I think in the long run we all benefit/ if you have you know if you're not working with someone on drugs well then you're going to have less accidents and you have less accidents and you spend less money on medical And you spend less money on medical then the company's more profitable The company's more profitable then maybe they can pay you more If they can pay you more you can buy more and then and it and it goes around you know to everywhere Yep all over And It certainly does and I I just hope that more and more companies get on the ball and and and start it up Well a lot of companies are are coming down in price and I think that the insurance companies are starting to give benefits You know re- reduction in in medical costs if you know they Yeah so I think everybody will will benefit from the program And I think if if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say well if you impose mandatory drug testing we'll reduce your insurance costs by you know twenty per cent And of course you know the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent they're going to reduce their own Yeah and that'll cover it And maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as a as part of the package Yeah So it I I think I think all around it it's going to help out a lot Course Yeah It was great talking with you You do the same Bye-bye
