<> I've heard some about Saturns I don't know a lot about them I haven't been over to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight's paper that said that their reliability is rated to be equal to that of the I guess the Japanese cars comment on trans delete line Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I've heard a lot of people like them yet I don't know wh- whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point I'm kind of my card and desires tend to be pretty picky and so Well let's see I li- I like cars that are designed with with human beings in mind and that's not just the driver and the passenger but that's the person who's working on it cause I do al- almost all my own maintenance and those types of things And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in finding a ca- car anymore that's that's fairly easy for me to work on it's just not very eas- it's not very almost unlikely at this point And yo- Ooh Uh-huh Yeah Well I've got an eighty-three Saab And I find that for a normal you know everyday things It's really very easy to work on and so you know I'm kind of spoiled I used to have a Chevy With a three fifty in it And I really liked working on it cause it was pretty easy too It was about a nineteen seventy So I'm kind of biased in that and you know I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore And that's kind of that's that's probably one thing I'd look at I think another thing I'd look at is safety Huh That's a real nice car I think I've driven some Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips as rental cars And I've always been very impressed with the Taurus It's a really nice car I think it's very it's a stylish car both inside and out It's comfortable to drive reasonable performance and this is out in California where where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore I've been real impressed with that Yo- and I didn't realize that they were putting dual air bags in that car now Uh-huh I think that That's excellent That's excellent because Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Sure Those are yeah that that would be a good deal to go with Okay Uh-huh What do you what do you looking for in in those What what attracts you to the Saturns Or or of course we've already talked you know the Taurus is safe But wh- what kind of things are you looking for Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Okay
