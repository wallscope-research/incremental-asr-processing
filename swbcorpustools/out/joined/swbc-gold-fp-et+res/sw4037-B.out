Yeah we do have the death penalty here It's not exercised very often but we do have it I believe it I can't even remember the last execution we had here actually personally I'm in favor of capital punishment I know there's a lot of lot of problems with it but seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that that the person just I feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in in prison for life But I know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but just seems like in some cases that it's a it's a good policy Uh-huh Right Right Right That's a that's a thought that I had never really had on that which seems pretty sensible Right Right Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah you're you're right there I gue- basically my views I guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that I just you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated I don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with so to me I'm paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever to keep somebody alive who I in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so I I'm all in favor of it Well I I really don't know on that question It just seems like for instance the Jeffrey Dahlmer case I don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society I hope the guy never gets back out on the streets and in that case Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment and I think that that he should not be allowed to live but you know then you're kind of playing God which is n- never a good thing to do But cases where I think the death penalty should be withheld not really that I can think of I I would I would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers I don't really agree with the death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that I think that they're they're operating on a more I know that they're causing massive problems in society up here but I don't really think that that it's it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live because they're feeding our consumer needs Uh-huh Yeah Yeah that is very curious Yeah That's that's right
