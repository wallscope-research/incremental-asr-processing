I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting when I do have spare time I love it That's my case also I've got a new born and there's just no time Have you been cross-stitching long really Mine sort of he looks at the pattern and he says how do you get that from there to the material it's not And once you get started on it it's just I just I love it two utts I do a lot of my own patterns also In fact I did one BILL THE CAT you know from Glenn County that was a real good one to do It was tough but yeah Do you have any others or is this mainly cross-stitching uh-huh Yeah I'm still trying to get all the D M C colors Yeah right Yeah Yeah I got to counting the other day and I think I have what was it two hundred and I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this is it yeah it can add up quick Uh-huh Right I see Well now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead you know what comes close Because a lot of them are similar Good grief Yeah there's lots of pinks and greens There's lots of shades of greens But the colors I just love all the different colors They had quite a few new ones come out last year that they added to But you don't have much spare time either yes And that does take some time And if we're trying to get acclimated with the with having a baby and He's seven months old And just into everything so there's not a spare moment but I wouldn't trade it for the world I've been trying to do some bibs for him And work on his Christmas stocking We missed it last year so hopefully this year he'll have one Right Right If it tasted good yeah All he liked was the lights this year so well that's neat that you like cross-stitching also Yeah I'm sorry Go ahead Okay but yeah I've been doing it for probably ten years or so But it is peaceful it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it On that is it one of those afghans that I've seen in the packages with the with the large squares uh-huh Well I've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching okay Uh-huh Yeah Those are pretty that's a That was a good That's great that now I've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it I like those Those are pretty Yes my grandmother made us a couple of quilts for the baby and I was like I don't want to mess those up there just too nice you don't get many hand made quilts anymore yeah Well I've enjoyed this But well keep up the good keep up the cross-stitching All right thanks Bye bye
