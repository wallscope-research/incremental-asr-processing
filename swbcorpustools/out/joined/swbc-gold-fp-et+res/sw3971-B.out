All right I like the Giants They got I probably didn't get into baseball until maybe maybe three years ago really so but I I just like the Giants I don't I don't know why I really got into them I read Dave Dreveki's book his autobiography and Yeah that that was incredible The way he handled that entire situation there But I just think the Giants have a good team They they got all you know they're they're they're real balanced out They got real good pitching and they got the hitting to go along with it So Yeah they just + they need that I think they just need that one one element to push them over the top you know I don't really know what it is but but every team that's that's really good seems you know like the As had they had they just had it all that one year So Yeah Yeah Yeah if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way you know you good and the bad but It's it's kind of hard I still basically the the me and all my friends around here since we don't have anywhere we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams but since no- me none of me and my friends are really really like either one of those teams so we about about the most baseball we get is either T V or we play it on Nintendo We play R B I baseball on Nintendo so So that's just you know that's small town trying to make it through the not being around it really but Yeah Yeah so do I but baseball is still you got you got to do something when football ain't on So Yeah exactly This is America so But I don't know it's hard to say I haven't really really you have to just keep up with everything in the off- season It's kind of hard to do at least you know you have to read the paper and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and and all that but like I say if they can if they can get that one element that they were missing I think the Giants can do it They just I don't yeah I don't really know about the A s I don't like the As matter of fact I can't stand the Oakland As Just because they have you know they've got their Jose Canseco and and all the attitude that goes along with that you know They kind of Yeah You hear what you hear what you hear what he did He ramming his wife's car and I was like yeah Yeah he's just a a a little boy with a lot of money So That's just you know but Yeah I've heard I've heard talk about that Yeah they're not going to be happy about it But I hope they can do good that's just I think they're a good team That just need that one one little thing to push them over I don't know exactly what it is They got they're pretty balanced out all the way through It just might be the drive you know more than anything else they just they probably just need something to push them because I that's that's the only thing I can see that's holding them back is the ambition to do it Or somebody basically maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it Maybe that's what you know that's what some teams need Look at the Twins going from worst to first Yeah my roommate my roommate's a Twins fan for forever so he had his year this year so We got pre- we we got into that a whole bunch That was a that was a series to remember for sure So I saw all seven games of that so That was definitely worth watching Yeah Yeah they every team with the Indians been doing that now I can't figure out why You have to figure out why they're all doing that I'm like it's doesn't work it's obvious it doesn't work because the you know the Braves Braves didn't win so why keep on doing something that didn't work but I don't know I was I was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball and I get a woman's voice I was I was I was thinking uh-huh I talked to a guy named Vinny last night about fixing your car so Yeah I got I called got a call the other night about fixing your automobile up so Well baseball's baseball It's kind of I don't know it's kind of odd they pick do you pick the topic or does the computer
