Well I primarily listen to classical music when I have my druthers partly because I find it more soothing I don't know a lot about classical music so far as any background in music but it's the po- the music I enjoy the most How about you Right Uh-huh I tend to listen to the classical music on the radio a lot There's one particular well there several stations in this area that play classical music all the time but there's one in particular that is on both A M and F M so I can listen to it without worrying It's cute though because my children when they get in the car and I have the button pushed for that they always switch it to something else Because naturally that isn't their taste at this point in time anyway Are are you involved in music Well my whole family is somewhat musical and not from training but just because we sing in our choir and my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing So I think that one of these days maybe she'll get involved in classical music too because that's usually what happens if you unless you get into rock which isn't her voice style So No I well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious It's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning Now I do like folk song and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that you know kind of still hang around But but the more popular music I don't care for usually even when I was a teenager I didn't really like the music of that period so much because I found I liked a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular rock and roll kind of sound Although now I kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll I guess it makes me think I'm young again Isn't that the truth It's funny In fact it's interesting to me that so many of the songs now I grew up in the late fifties and early sixties and so much of the music that was popular at that time has come back And you you don't hear everything all the time but you hear much of the same music perhaps a new version of it but it's the same stuff which is always kind of funny and I remember my older sister I have a sister who's sixteen years older and at the time that I was a teenager a late teenager I guess I can't remember the year SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES became popular I think it was done by maybe the Platters or something Then and she laughed and she said Well you know when I was a teenager that had been you know some years before she said that was a version of you know a song then And she said It's very similar but they've changed a little bit She said I like the original version better Well they did it again about two or three years ago and I laughed again I said Oh no here we are Right right It does indeed Uh-huh Yes now there there's some wonderful Christian music when you can find good stations the pro- problem that I found in this area is that the there there is inconsistency in the quality here If you get someone who's very good at selecting it's okay but sometimes they kind of get on a a a binge and they play the same sort of thing over and over again without really necessarily quality I live in the Washington D C area Maryland Yes Uh-huh and I I you know there's so much available that I don't understand why they do that But now my children have have sometimes they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of Christian musicians that come to our youth group at our church And and when they buy a tape or something sometimes that's fun because it's different and something I've not always heard and you know I enjoy that wow Yeah that's nice So is your husband a singer Right Yeah Well that's a good thing to do That's nice well do you have children Well wonderful That'll be a musician there's some wonderful Christian children's tapes You can you can get and I know when my children were younger we found a lot of really nice tapes that they that they liked there was an Agape music group and I some of the songs I still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really very memorable even though my children are now my youngest is almost sixteen But I still find some of the same tapes I some of the same songs from those tapes I enjoy there's one that's a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect And she's playing the piano And so she she gets the wrong note every now and then But then she keeps repeating it practice makes perfect and then you know talking about that so far as Christian life too and it's really cute Yeah Yeah right Yeah well do you know something Because I have always played classical music or classical style it's not always classical as you know the official word might go but even when I was pregnant of course I listened to that and when our first child was you know an infant of course when I was around the house I played that music too When he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale the music scale Someone else noticed it and I said well I guess that's true And it was somewhat melodious in other words it wasn't just you know it was really funny Right right I do think there is probably an influence there because I noticed that even though popular music the the wilder stuff was around when my older children were were you know adolescents early adolescents when they first start listening to music on their own they first get ask for a radio of their own and so on this same child really listened to more ballady or pleasant sort of songs rather than and even classical rather than the real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to And I I never I didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore Right But then I must say they all kind of like a variety of music which is nice I like that Yeah Well it was nice talking to you and good luck with the baby Bye-bye
