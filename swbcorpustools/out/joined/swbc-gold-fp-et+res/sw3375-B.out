<> that might be a lot to do with it I know a lot of it here in my state I'm from Mississippi I'm not sure where you're from Minnesota okay Well a lot of it in Mississippi here has got to do with funding Problems with our educational system a lot of it's due to money And they're trying to spend money where we don't have it and there's a lot of things we need that we just can't afford Well it is Right That's true And a lot of it lot of it has to do with salaries too speaking of money Cause if you can't pay the right people you know they're not to be able to do they're not not going to get the people that can do a good job Right Right I feel the same way A lot has to do with how the kids were raised at home And then when the kids get to school they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids they've so severely limited what disciplinary action you can do Exactly Right Lose their job and big lawsuit and all that I feel that's got a lot to do with it People aren't as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be Really We we've talked some about it in my state because we've had a lot of prob- our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education but he wasn't And a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly I know a lot a lot of if you have more money it's just logical that you can provide a better school system And unfortunately there's not many places to get that money Then if you don't have qualified teachers in the different I know one of my physics professors at college has addressed this That most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level aren't scientists they're teachers And they may not know a lot about what they're teaching Where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses and they're trying to teach social studies And they don't know a lot about that Where maybe a physics professor he my professor was a physics professor and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background of physics at the high school level So therefore they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view And that causes a lot of trouble Right Exactly Because here in the town I went to high school one of the there were four high schools in my county one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado So when they rebuilt that school they had a a top of the line high tech school there And the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties and then when the evaluation committees came through they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones Telling them what they needed to do to fix up this building and this and this and this and so it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them Right Exactly
