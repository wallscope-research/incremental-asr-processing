I would say the medical group insurance area as far as covering medical costs for yourself or family members Yeah I think I work for a public school system district and so it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing where the school district does the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of costs But overall I've been pleased with it over the years I think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to alter you know change companies or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any How about yourself Uh-huh Right yeah Our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety school year calendar years and I was in the H M O and I was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for they usually sign a contract or something and I did have surgery last summer and I paid ten dollars when I went to see him that first day and I've never seen another bill so I I have to say it really works But again I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for you know those people Uh-huh Yeah Right but if you you know have a family and and everybody's gone to different doctors it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it I I'm sure it would be very stressful and my husband and I have just elected that if that happens I will go and just pay You can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as you know good so all right I do too Are you talking about like Spring Break and Right Right It it really I don't think most of our teachers now I'm not a teacher I am a secretarial executive assistant but I don't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly It is just Texas has really you know they want everybody educated no matter what it costs and it it would be just we all look forward to like in two weeks we have Spring Break and I don't know who looks forward to it more the students or the teachers and the staff What do you do there Okay Well that's good Yeah I would think that that type of employment you're you're one day you might be really tuned in and the next day a little luke warm or something and it's good that they allow you that It as I say the schools now we do have to work you know the day but we do get many days off and we all look forward to it That's the only reason I work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college but at the time I worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and I've just continued to stay there
