Unfortunately yes in fact tonight I had the dinner with my three brothers and our wives and we were talking we had a review with the nursing home staff My mother's in a nursing home And we had a review today and a few things we had to do that are part of it that you don't really like like making decisions on living wills and extended care that type of thing so yes I'm very familiar with it and it's not something that is you know I never thought I'd have to go through this kind of experience But I guess we all do really Uh-huh Right Well they're not every all the horror stories you hear about them I think are true we've you know we've looked around and my wife has looked at extensively at all the ones in the area And the one she is in now there's a lot of drawbacks a lot of things we don't like But again it's no different than every one And you know the cost of it the three thousand dollars a month when you think about it for what you're paying a hospital for almost the same well even not as much care It's not that expensive really Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh really Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Well I'll be darned Uh-huh Yeah Yeah you you know this is the whole point You've got you've got to shop them I know my mother's in now in a unit that's mainly Alzheimer's and we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric the fact that these people are they're up and around but they're they're it's reminds me too much of an asylum type s- situation And it's very very She well who knows They call it dementia And we don't know I I mean she does not know us anymore and whether it's Alzheimer's or what it is nobody really knows but it's basically the same And her health is not that bad Although she has gone down downhill drastically since this this last well she had been in a retirement community and somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children Well she we we just did not have the capabilities to to take care of her And but she she has gone down steadily since she has been in and she's been in the nursing home now for I would say about three months And I'm sorry She no as far as she knew she was going to a hospital And that she could she could handle a hospital and we says you know mom if you you know if you get a you get better you've got to have the care the doctor insisted on it you know if you get better that you could come out
