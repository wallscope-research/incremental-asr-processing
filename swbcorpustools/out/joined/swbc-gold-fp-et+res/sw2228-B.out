All right feelings on what caused the S and L crisis I guess I don't have a real technical knowledge for what happened I gather that there where large numbers of situations where loans were made that appeared to be a good loan but in a speculative since and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during the Reagan eight years more and more S and L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans and then when they began to collapse one after the other I think almost like an avalanche of of property values devalued Right I don't have a a field for whether or not this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome scandal are you familiar with that from your histories lessons or whatever I vaguely recall but I've never gone and done any study on it since the S and L thing that teapot dome scandal is when I think during the Hoover years where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that that appeared to be corruption within the Hoover administration I don't have a real since of of like corruption that caused S and L all though I have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sourer maybe Uh-huh Yeah It seems like there were on awful a lot of people making loans and business decisions on a get rich quick is the wrong phrase but if it captures some of the the feeling I have from the people making business decisions that if they failed it's sort of well no skin of my back I'll move on to this other company or I I just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were were making the decisions for And I don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didn't weren't stuck to where they were and things begin to collapse they just moved on Or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base that they that they didn't care any more I just I'm rather puzzled about the whole thing Okay Well they didn't they didn't have a since of risk okay Uh-huh Okay Okay Well do you think we there's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies an nickels but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or or that that they really do understand how much money it is for awhile it seemed like every time I opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of damage did is your since that we now understand how bad it is listen or is there more to be heard yet So you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet or whether Uh-huh To be caught in the Do you think to possibly is that it will help with the regular banks It seems that I recall reading for the last let's say starting three years a go but not so much in the last year of bank risks of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico Venezuela and Argentina based on oil loans and then the price of oil had had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky and I guess I read articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans I have this vague since that that could happen that that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost Uh-huh And so you think that it's just gone Okay Do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program like my since is it was there to try to protect small investors but it ended up protecting big investors Which I don't think what it was meant to do so I guess I I feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exist for these sorts of problems so your since is that the that the loan guaranties which really were accounts guaranties so the so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money And given that the S and Ls have had disasters then those account holders are are their money is still being protected And that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands I guess of Of dollars being protected It it seems like there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts it's if if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred bi- billion dollars and we're taking about monies way in access of that now so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts And perhaps multiple people in multiple S and Ls and and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought You know that the for I guess I'm content with the need to have protection on on accounts but I feel likes it's on an individual basis Someone whose got accounts in thirty-five different S and Ls or thirty or forty thousand dollars and they're all protected by the government Seems to me like they've gotten around what was intended to be the issue there Uh-huh I guess I don't have a personal since of V on it since I was not a heavy user of any S and Ls and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt And I guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again because that means I'm not worried enough it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive and then I then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things Uh-huh Well perhaps if there are regulatory constraints put back in place It will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation
