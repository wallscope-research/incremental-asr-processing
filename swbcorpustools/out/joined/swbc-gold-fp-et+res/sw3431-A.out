Okay Mike I guess we'll be talking about painting recently Any kind of recent painting you've done yourself Have you done any recently Uh-huh Wow wow that's that's quite a chore Yes I imagine it did Did you have that done professionally or did you do that yourself Did you enjoy that that's that's fun We just recently had our boys' room our two oldest boys share a room and they're the paint has kind of faded and deteriorated and so we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth and looks quite good We were quite pleased with the result Yes it's a project that I did yes and and Well I don't think it's sun exposure but boys will be boys and there there were crayon marks on there and we had to to scrub the crayon marks off of course try and get it clean Pardon me Yes it was It was latex paint and that's what we put back on there was a latex paint Plus they had bunk beds and the boy one of the younger boys when he was younger about three years old got a got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures Yes on the ceiling And you scrub and you scrub but you can't it all off And so that's one of the reasons why we painted and We used a flat latex paint and in the bedroom as I understand that's one of the better type of paints to have because it's not so reflective and and glassy colored and it turned out real real well Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh you had to prime it and and se- cover over it Huh Well I like to use this this Sears the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee Yeah And the reason being is once I painted I don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later but and we're quite satisfied with that and and occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale and we do do that In fact I was just reading an article you mentioned painting your bathroom I read an article recently that you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to to peel or come off because of the moisture high moisture content in your bath bathroom And did you have any problems with that or good Uh-huh good Nei- neither have I good Uh-huh Yeah Do you have you ever used an oil base paint Uh-huh Wh- why do you use that I'm I'm kind of learning at this new at this but It adheres better or lasts longer okay Uh-huh Right Well that's good that's good have you ever done any painting outside
