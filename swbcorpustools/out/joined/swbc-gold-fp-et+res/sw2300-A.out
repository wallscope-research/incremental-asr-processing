Okay so do you all keep a budget You don't Are you being smart or are you serious Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh That's funny Yeah we have a we're twenty eight and he's been working at T I for five years and that was pretty much his first real really major job of any you know professional because he had worked you know part time during school and what not and he was a little late graduating so we're you know and we have a nine and a half year old son and it's because you know we were eighteen when we had him so we're we're kind of looking at this from the other aspect of we you know we have a lot for to be our age and you know just everything and having the responsibilities we've had on us for at such a young age You know we have a like a nice house People you know are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house But we don't you know live in a brand new house either maybe a ninety hundred thousand dollar house but we're in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty-five thousand So you know we have trade-offs So we're more we have a monthly budget with this this this this But we have no savings which isn't real wise but we just we don't have the income at this time really to have any because we have three debts that we're trying to pay off from both of our student loans We're still paying trying to pay those off And we have one car payment that we don't I think we have about thirteen months left on it And after that we either what we want to do is begin doubling up our car payment they'll pay our car payment is equivalent to both of our student loans So what we want to do is next year keep driving the same cars and pay on the student loans split that car payment in half and pay you know double up payments on both our loans And it'll work out perfect No we don't Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Really Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh really Uh-huh Uh-huh Does she have to pay to have it refinanced Uh-huh T Ier to See we got ripped off buying our new car We both come out of drugs and stuff and we became Christians about five years ago Right when he got home from Terrell Right before he got hired for T I he had gotten saved and stuff and so when you get come out of drugs and stuff you have nothing you know you don't have anything You have the clothes on your back and you might have a car and that kind of thing And so when he when he started working at T I we you know we really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas But we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years and we were young and we'd look about nineteen People still think we're about they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff both of us And so it's just kind of strange you know so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs you know So we went in and the financed the car for five and we didn't know that We got kind of taken just a little bit So we're kind of upset that we're having to you know pay this fifth year on the car because it was just not a wise thing But we learned a good lesson So you know Yeah but they they would have only been about twenty dollars a month higher and he want- Yeah he just told me this last week that he he said don't you remember I asked them to finance it at four years and they came back and they said that they had it figured for five and we'd already signed the papers And I maybe I might have been there I don't remember hearing that But I also wasn't the one in charge of it so I wasn't paying as close of attention But anyway instead of putting our foot down about it we just went okay whatever you know So anyway so next time we'll do that different We want to next time pay cash for our car too We want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do When we buy a house we attended a Bill financial seminar and he has a lot of wisdom on that just on Biblical you know principles to finance He runs a big the largest real estate company in Fort Worth debt free And we really believe in debt free living and debt free car buying and debt free house buying And if we do take out a loan on a house in the future what we'll do is pay twice a twice a month on it and because you save a lot in interest just doing that And then Right Right Right Right really Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right Yeah we real- we've become aware of that We have a there's a loan officer through our church too that I think could help us better You know he does that full time with the bank you know And so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are people of integrity So You know that is another thing that you know we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time we buy a car we're not just going to go to Toyota of Irving you know we're going to go to somebody that we know we're going to take someone with us older and we didn't do any of those things Yeah Really my I stopped payment on a check that's funny this last week we bought a sewing machine at Zak's and then I found that you could get the same machine better for less locally Not much less but it was enough less and I found they locally serviced it And we just stopped payment on the check So I hope they don't sue us over it But we never received any merchandise either so I don't think it would hold any- Anyway No we didn't even call them We just did it Maybe my husband should call today
