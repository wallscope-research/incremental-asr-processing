Okay where does she live Rutherford I don't know that Uh-huh It's south and okay yeah I know where you I know the area Right that's kind of on the other side of town so our kids probably never went to school together or anything well I've got one in college By now Right Whether it is possible to have an honest government I'm beginning to think it's not What about you I don't either I I think even if people have good intentions I think power corrupts or something to a certain extent you know Yeah it seems like maybe more of them come in with good intentions but it's just so enticing and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available because they're in on the know you know Oh Right you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions you know what I mean Little bitty little bitty positions in your own home town and they'll cheat somehow or you know bend the rules use their power So maybe it's just man's nature Uh-huh my word wow What were they doing taking some no gosh Yeah right Right  We haven't had that big a scandal in Arlington but we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records In other words they'd go out and have a big lavish dinner and then put somebody's name down that they supposedly had entertained but that person wasn't even anywhere near there you know Some of them weren't even in the same city One of them had had cancer and died and that was our biggest scandal for the last few years I think I don't I don't either to make it totally honest I think there's there's always going to be some way somebody can cut a corner However the things that have gone gone on in the last couple of years we can't afford too many of those you know the the HUD mess or the S and L We could almost not afford such terrible corruption Right right I think that Reagan and Bush were up to their necks in that Iran Contra thing and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that but Right Uh-huh uh-huh That's right but they stay there Uh-huh Right and this would be for the best for the nation overall You're right it's just a I don't know I guess that's where they stay in in they try to stay in office But they always please the money people too They need money so much because they're constantly having to run for office again And Uh-huh That's true Boy it is a big problem but I think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now/ don't you I know It's really terrible there was a time where I remember when I was real young I just loved Harry Truman I thought he was great you know I had some of them seemed like kind of heroic people
