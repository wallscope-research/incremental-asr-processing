Real problem the last few days one of their young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season it was a catcher And they really don't have an excess of catchers and it's really kind of kind of late to you know to start be trying to trade for somebody especially with the salary cap that the Rangers have They're not the highest paying ball team around But I you know I would I would gladly take the salary of most of the guys I'll tell you Yeah that's right I really haven't been an active Ranger fan in several years I used to go take my son you know when he was in high school he enjoyed going to baseball games I'll have to admit I kind I kind of went more to see to see the other team a lot of times than I did the did the Rangers But I think they're doing better Yeah I can imagine I used to love to play baseball when I was a kid I think it's more fun to play than it is to watch Yeah of course of course As a matter of fact I read in the sports page this morning he just pitched his first exhibition game a day or so ago and he pitched five yeah five full innings That was almost unheard of for a pitcher to you know to start out that strong no big deal you know it's just part of a days work He's something else he really is They could do very well they sure could Uh-huh uh-huh right Yeah they've got I guess all well all their players are signed now Some of them are not too happy about it but there there's no hold outs So that should help Yeah it should uh-huh Oh yeah sure Sure sure uh-huh Cincinnati Yeah there sure are Uh-huh uh-huh that's right I've never seen the Astros play Huh-uh Uh-huh That's right They sure are Wouldn't it be something to have a World Series between Da- the Rangers and the Astros Boy I tell you that would draw a crowd wouldn't it It sure would That's right wouldn't that be something It sure would Absolutely But there are a lot of Ranger fans around Yeah Uh-huh yeah Uh-huh boy he's a bull isn't he He really is gosh Uh-huh that's right That's right it's kind of like Babe Ruth Yeah they were saying something about this may be his last year with the Rangers though Apparently I think his contract is up after the end of this year and they're not sure they're going to be able to sign him again Yeah that you know may or may not happen That's right it's a long way away That's right That's right unfortunately the Rangers don't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do Yeah that's right Is there going to be a ticket increase this year price do you know I haven't either The those Cowboys have increased their prices again this year But I didn't know I I don't think I've heard anything on the Rangers or I don't remember it if I have Yeah Yeah I guess it's too early Uh-huh it's a good idea yeah Uh-huh yeah if you have young young children you know they they get a kick out of it Uh-huh Well you too Lori Right you take care Okay bye-bye
