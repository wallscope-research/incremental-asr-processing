Um one thing you know that I always think about when I think of public education cause I went through the public um school system of Boston and uh I always felt that I graduated high school and I still didn't even I I couldn't put together a map of the United State You know what I mean An yet I felt that I got a good education and I I did well in school but you tell me to name you know five continents an I couldn't do it I just felt like there were some real basics that are missing from education and the people are are leaving school not even knowing some common sense things Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right Yeah um did you do through a public school system or private Uh-huh did you notice a big difference Like in what sense Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I work in a temporary agency an they're people that come in you know every day to fill out an application and they'll have to bring somebody with them and they will show that they completed um four year of high school yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application they can't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves it's just incredible Really Yeah I know um they uh I forget I think it's um some place in New York because they're having budget problems they're closing the libraries I mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports or anything like that they're not cutting in any other corner they're closing the libraries That to me shows a little uh switch in priorities You know So do you go to college right now Are yo- You're a so you're a senior now Oh good for you That's great um is is N C University is that uh State What did you say N C State that's a State University then I see And you're from there also Uh-huh I see Well pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college It's just a outrageously expensive Oh is it Well still though I mean you know thousands of dollars Oh well that's good That's good I went to a private university and um I don't know I look back now and I I think that I probably would have done it differently if I um you know could do it over again But um I have a lot of friends that went to state schools or didn't even go to school some some of them and I still feel like they came out knowing just as much as I did I really do and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say but um I don't know I I what I went to Brandice University It's in Massachusetts And um I really felt like I've been working now for about four years and I I feel like what I've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school And I know that I'm drawing a lot of what I learned in school you know I I probably just subconsciously rely a lot on on art But um I don't know my sister's a principal at a school and one thing she's trying to instill in kids um besides just reading and writing are just some the golden rules she calls them just some basics about um you know you don't take what's not yours uh and if you want to you know you don't touch anybody else unless you have their permission Like no hitting you know no pulling hair or anything like that and uh the school that she's in is a um it's basically for minorities um there's a large minority population And um she's really noticed that even some of the teachers that work there I think they don't value that type of student as much as you get in some Yeah it's true Uh-huh And I don't know if it makes them feel better I mean the do teachers get I mean personally I would get more satisfaction out of taking someone that wasn't as successful And seeing what they could do verses somebody that did excel in in areas and just watching them get better you know That's not much of a challenge But ar- do you have any ideal what you're going into when you graduate Oh yeah Do you know where you're going Where's that Oh is that North Carolina Oh okay No I don't know that area I just don't know it I don't get down there very often Oh really well the way I pick the final four was um by the state that had the warmest climate So that's how I chose all mine so you can tell that I really didn't have that much to do with any of it But so obviously you're into education If you can be going my husband went to is in graduate school actually right now And uh I don't know I give you a lot of credit I couldn't do it I I couldn't wait to graduate and have it be all over I know  Yeah I kind of know what you mean Well it was really nice talking to you Okay Good luck All righty take care Bye-bye
