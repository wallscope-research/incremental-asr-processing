Well hang on let me try it again because usually Yeah  Well let me try it once more Well I think we're on maybe I guess we'll find out So in Maryland are you are you a Skins fan Yeah okay So you were out there in San Francisco yeah  Yeah it's other than the the big catch with the Forty-niners and the Cowboys ba- back a few year ago I like San Francisco But I I don't know I I never really was a Cowboys fan until I moved down to Texas Yeah I'm in Dallas and I guess when you're down here in Dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the Cowboys because you know this is a big football territory down here And unfortunately of course the Cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years That I don't know everybody's kind of they're still behind them but it's not like it used to be That's right But I think actually in in trying to follow you know the Cowboys over the years I think they used to have a a philosophy for well I don't know probably the last twenty-five years except for about the last about five or six years they always went out and tried to draft the the best athletes And didn't really put them draft for any particular spot But they would go out and try to go for the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche And then about five years ago four or five years ago they started going after specific players or positions you know like the press would get down on Landry and this is when Schramm was still there And they'd go after them saying jeez what you really need is a defensive end So they'd go out and try to find a defensive end and when they when they drafted somebody and he didn't workout at that spot it really wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else And so I think it was kind ever interesting I think the decline of the of the Cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with not drafting people the best athletes Yeah yeah But Yeah they still have some some some draft picks that they got No Actually they picked up some from Minnesota I think it was Minnesota's Yeah They traded Walker yeah That's okay they I've got a friend that lives right next to the Cowboys' training camp And he gets he sees them out running a lot and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys and they're all they're all thinking that man they they they really got something going this year but I I guess when you have a whole bunch of professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes You know I guess it's the same way with baseball or or anybody you know Spring training until you actually start going out and getting getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good Yeah really Yeah yeah really Yeah they did As a matter of fact Yeah Well you don't you don't like the Skins okay Jeez Well of course Yeah yeah Yeah of course then you're not that far from Philadelphia okay I it was Buddy Ryan the one that I can't stand too much Yeah really Uh-huh jeez Yeah actually you said you lived near Baltimore You're out I used to travel out that way a lot and actually I used to drive a lot between Baltimore and Washington and no okay Yeah I used to go out of B W I a lot yeah Is that near near the what do they I forgot the name of it Is it the the Wharf or the the Inner Harbor Yeah Great Yeah I tell you what I the ther- there's the Colts still you know still to me are the Baltimore Colts You know okay Jeez Yeah so you know did you graduate from Purdue Delaware there's not a whole lot in Delaware Yeah that's true I take it you're an east coast type guy Plus the west coast right
