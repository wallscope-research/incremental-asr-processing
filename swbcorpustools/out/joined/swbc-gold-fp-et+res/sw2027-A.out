Okay I don't know about you but where I am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies like every day from jeans one day to business suits the next It's pretty bad but it's true you know <> they tend to try to be you know real lax and supposedly the policy is like you know we you know we hire these wonderful creative people and we don't want to smush their creativity you know We want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want And you know you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next Yeah Yeah you know we're kind of that way too I try to I'm the same way you are I kind of try to judge from day to day I know you know where I am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and and you know if I know that they're going to be there you know you I try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up and if I know they're not you know I I've been doing a lot of reorganization you know the last couple of months the same way you are you know and it's just it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress It is and so  Uh-huh no no <> how awful It sounds like Mister Power Hungry You know just yesterday though I saw a girl in the spine out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts And I don't care you can call them split skirts and you can call them culottes all you want but these were shorts That's all they were I don't care what else you call them you know if they're below the knee okay maybe you can call them split skirts If they're above the knee they turn into shorts you know And these weren't even really full ones they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were you know the real wide full ones you know and becau- these weren't even those These were like pretty short black and they were very dressy the were black velvet shorts and she had on black hose and black heels and she looked very very nice But you don't wear shorts to work You know as far as I'm considered she was in violation and nobody says anything to them It's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime You know if they just you know the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an cut off you know that no this is wear we're going to draw the line This is shorts you know And and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that you know so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well God we have a pair of those at home too It sure would be cool and comfortable to wear you know but Yeah Yeah and then during the week you see these women in the you know just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore you know I've never seen them do it without hose they always have hose on but still it's they're shorts I don't care what you say they're shorts Well I think T I's dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway you know do they really my God I coul- I couldn't afford to work there no Uh-huh T Is says no shorts and no halters I know that's it Wow I don't know that that would be a good environment to work in I see I I am more I don't know about anybody else and a lot of bosses may say I'm nuts but I am more productive when I'm in pants I I am I work faster I get things done faster than when I'm in a dress and heels you know I and it's weird but I it's I do I can I can get so much more done if I'm dressed comfortable you know Right Yeah Uh-huh You can't do that in a skirt poor soul yuck Yeah that's terrible that's terrible gosh Well I don't know I just figure you know yeah sometimes I worry about you know if I go in in pants and I never I never ever ever ever go in in a pair of jeans you know But I'll go in in pants today I had on a pair of you know navy blue dress slacks and and like a peach colored top and you know not cruddy but not a dress either And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that would will hold you back you know if you don't dress in you know your dress for success business suits everyday if you know if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on but you know I don't know if they do or not You know I see a lot of the managers and they're in jeans so you know Really wow Uh-huh Yeah Isn't that funny That's great Yeah That's the way to do it that's the smart way to do it It really is because your making you know if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in in you know a six hundred dollar three piece suit it's going to make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable you know or it would me you know Yeah yeah look at this slick guy I wonder what kind of money does he make uh-huh I can see it now Well it was good to talk to you It was really enjoyable It really is yuck yeah Well it's kind of enjoyable I'm really looking forward to it Well thanks a lot Bye-bye
