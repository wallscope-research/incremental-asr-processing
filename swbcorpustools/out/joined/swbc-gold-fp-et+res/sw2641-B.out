Do you have any pets Two cats <> Uh-huh Yeah I like having ca- cats around pets around in general I I favor dogs over cats actually but I'm I'm a dog person I had I guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid right Uh-huh But not cats Uh-huh The thing I don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek of the dogs and constantly Yeah that's true Uh-huh Limited really Uh-huh that sounds so easy what I did Yeah I housesat from cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis and what we used to do was just put newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter and then I would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing Then I would do it you know everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very very rarely and so it wasn't so bad two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling I would put just a little bit of cat litter in there because if I put a lot one of the cats would have been all of her animals that she ever had were adopted I that true yeah Yeah she's even got she's got one dog now and the two cats and her dog there is is basically a reject somebody had bought him and wanted him It was her ex boyfriend and you know just was not mature enough to keep the dog didn't realize how much work it was and now she's stuck with it And she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals but I think that for me well my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat because that's all there is to it So you know No we don't have anything right now right now we have a kid but he was completely against having a dog or cat he said they're much they're as much work as a kid and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend And Uh-huh That's yeah really true But like the friends other friends of mine have cats they have four of them and if they go away they have they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their cats you know their so used to the attention that if they don't get it they get really upset and you know they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that I I tried to have figured something having so I tried to have a goldfish and I killed that one within a very short amount of time Right My brother had fish when I was a kid I remember that and one of his fish jumped out of the gosh what do you call it fish tank And fried itself on the radiator behind the dresser I'll never forget that because I remember my brother he came home and he counted the fish and one of the fish was missing and they couldn't find it anyplace they couldn't figure out what had happened and then they found it fried on the radiator behind it was not gross I didn't see it but got them Trying to remember we had a dog for a while and I don't know if we got rid of the dog because my brother was allergic to it my brother had asthma and some allergies which I think he's outgrown now but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards and then he had fish And you they're like you say they're not the most exciting pet to have Well a friend of mine had an eel and then he had a I forget what type of fish it was it was one of these fish that i- it would eat it ate a big other fish and things like that There would be sort of moby fish in a tank Yeah and it I I couldn't see having fish like that I could see some having maybe some of the tropical fish that are really really pretty but Uh-huh Yeah Yeah no that would be what did they do everyone come around and watch them I guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house and your things destroyed the mice But Let's see I had a pet rat for a while and it was a live rat and this woman just offered it to me while I was in in graduate school and she was actually a very fun pet Uh-huh Yeah mine had been a a a how did this work a mill rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said you know this rat is acting really strange I think he's sick and she said I don't think he's sick I think she's pregnant And they had misclassed the sex of back there and so she asked me if I want to one of those babies and I took the baby and I got her when she was you know just this tiniest little thing like half the price of a mouse and then she grew to be you know I had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty big you know like a pound or something I don't know how much and I had her for over two years and she was very affectionate She would you know crawl on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while I was working and things like that Yeah much more than you would think Yeah and Yeah I sort of weird for me to have had one too but there it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in it's cage and you know it was easy Easy to take care of and but Uh-huh Actually it was more fun than you would think Yeah starting from the beginning but yeah we live also live in the city now actually in Manhattan And so it's almost impossible to it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here or certainly certainly not a dog people do but it's not yeah you see all these people yeah these stately people and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them it's really kind of funny Uh-huh Right no they don't I should make you they have the bags behind them but I think they're actually supposed to keep them yeah keep them clean but gosh I can't even walk by Central Park yeah when summertime just the smell is so bad of the horses well it's not that long ago It was twelve times of the year Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah that's not too far from were we live do you have you said you had two cats are they just what you call it are they breed cats or anything or are they just Uh-huh <> Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh They're both females Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh
