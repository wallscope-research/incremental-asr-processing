Okay well I'm not I read a lot but I don't I don't read a whole <> I I I I tend to read like only out of a couple you know groups and I'm a I'm a big baseball fan so I tend to read a lot of the baseball books and okay And I read a lot of science fiction Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh <> Yeah I I don't really I pro- probably should I don't really read the self-improvement books or things like that I I'll get like books on history and stuff like that that look interesting And I of course I don't ever get around to reading them You know I got I b- I belong to Quality Paperback Book Club And I'll get get stuff out of that Like I got BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM you know like a couple of years ago And I started reading and got about sixty pages into it and it's like eight hundred pages And it was like I want to read something else for a while Yeah Yeah Well especially you know well BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM starts off you know in the eighteen forties you know And it's like wait the war wasn't until the eightee- you know It's like okay and I realize these things you know These things take awhile like to move up but it's you know it's hard sometimes I read a lot of science fiction Yeah Yeah That and I I do the same thing I Yeah there's one science fiction writer named Allen Dean Foster okay yeah He I must have like fifty or sixty books by him I have you know I have everything he's ever well almost everything he's ever done And you know I I know that when I you know when I get his book I'm I'm usually going to enjoy it so it's really you know it's it's fun to to do that Yeah Well he does a lot of like movie adaptations and things like that Yeah And his adaptations are usually really good it's it's funny he the the novelization of STAR WARS was list- you know it it was out in the in the stores as being by George Lucas But it turns out that Foster actually ghost wrote it for him Wh- which you know when I read it I should have realized that because it had Foster's style written all over it Yeah I'm sure he does I'd hope so Well I mean he's doing all right probably Yeah That's true Well yeah You you're a baseball fan you're you're aware of that kind of thing Uh-huh Yeah I had a had a subscription to that last year but I'm I'm mostly a baseball fan So I'm I'm not as inter- you know the other stuff is interesting but I was mostly interested in the baseball stuff actually I'm a Red Sox fan more than anything Yeah but I I I do like the Orioles also Yeah <> Toledo I was in Toledo last summer Went to a to a Mud Hens double header Yeah Y- I saved that issue actually that's when I had the subscription Yeah it was a lot of fun They don't exist anymore I don't think At least not by that name There's the Iowa Cubs but I don't know if they play in the same location  I minor league baseball I think is a lot more fun than major league baseball And it's a lot cheaper Yeah There's there's a city just west of Freder- of Baltimore called Frederick It's about forty miles west And they have a minor league team And I go out there almost as much as the Orioles and I it's just a lot of fun it's free parking and three bu- bu- you know four bucks now to get in And you know the hot dogs are a dollar and and it's just great Oriole game If you park in the lot across the street from the stadium it's four bucks The ticket the ch- the cheapest ticket you can normally get is like six fifty to seven fifty Yeah And hot dogs like start at a dollar fifty that's nice Yeah Uh-huh Well how much are the box seats there Do you know offhand Yeah That's that's a little steeper I think the most expensive seats in Memorial are eleven bucks But we're getting a new stadium next year so Yeah it'll go up And if it opens It's something we're really irritated about around here Or some people are really irritated about They're they're building this new sta- they built the new stadium downtown And they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium But I park for free up at at Memorial Stadium because I know where I can do it for free And I'm not going to be able to do that downtown Yeah We Uh-huh Uh-huh Weren't you guys supposed to get a stadium in downtown Dallas it d- it didn't go through okay Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah That's that's what I'd always heard I've Uh-huh Yeah That's about what it takes me to get to Memorial it's actu- it actually funny that I live just outside of Baltimore And it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to Frederick but as it does to go to the the ballpark in Me- in Baltimore Because to go out to Frederick I just jump on the Interstate and because I live just south of the Interstate H- hop on the Interstate and the stadium's right off the Interstate So it's like I drive west and I'm there And you know and then to go into Baltimore it well it's fewer miles but I've got to go stop and go traffic and everything Do you read I guess you read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED but you don't read many sports books or Uh-huh Huh There was I understand there was a really good basketball b- book called A SEASON ON THE BRINK Yeah I'm not sure I don't know <> I'm trying to think of the guy's name It was like John Feinstein or something like that wrote it I just heard about it the other night I was listening to something on the radio about you know a talk show about sports books and they and they mentioned that one Yeah And I was thinking about there was a I saw a book kicking around on the history of the A B A which Yeah I get in to even when I don't like the sport so much <> I get interested in the history of sports franchises
