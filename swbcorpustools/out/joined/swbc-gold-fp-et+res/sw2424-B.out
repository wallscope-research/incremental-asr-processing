There we go Yes and no Income tax no I I look at it this way you've got to pay for the privilege of living here But being a a rec vehicle owner well in fact I live in a motor home I'm a ful- what they call a full timer and it burns gas like crazy I only get seven miles to the gallon I really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes and they call it what's the word they use anyway a a luxury tax They ga- add it on on to tires and gasoline cigarettes liquor It doesn't bother me any because I've quit drinking and I quit smoking So that doesn't bother me but I don't think it's fair It's too it's attacking just certain people Even with the gasoline tax No fifty years ago the automobile was a luxury but it's a necessity today and as hard as they try to get these public transit things going I have never seen nor heard of one that really got of the ground Or that accomplish what they set out to com- to accomplish What are your feelings on it Yeah That that's that's so true they say well you voice your opinion on election day No you don't Look what happened on the last presidential election read my lips And what happened they turned around and double crossed us So you can't believe what you hear Oh yes I agree and and I I also think we extend too much help to other countries we need enough help here in this country They're still people starving people here They're> There're why should we help starving people somewhere else Absolutely Now I can't wait for I I could just picture wha- what's going to happen here in the not to distant future We keep hearing well we're going to receive eight billion dollars from Japan for the uh-huh the the the big war over there in the Mideast And so many billions of dollars here and there and everything and the next thing you know we'll be turning around just like we did to Poland and say well just forget it definitely Well another thing now they keep decontrolling different things First it was the airlines then it was banks and and savings association and whatnot Exactly And the same with the airlines back in the days when they were controlled and and Transcontinental or Interstate Trucking as soon as the federal government gave up control on all that they just went to hell in a hand basket Prices went sky high Then in in the case of airlines of course they became highly competitive and they cut each others throats until they're they reach the point where they're cutting their own throat And well of course that's getting away from taxes isn't it th- that's government controlled But by the time you get through with the the penalties I agree I think the I R S is just too powerful There should be some sort of a control on it And they should be a little more humane the typical bureaucratic I guess That's that's one of my pet peeves I came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the the budget Very simple Give government employees the average number of holidays as the private industry you think about it now they they get about sixteen holidays a year It sure is And I think here at TI we get what is it nine or ten Well I remember thinking I think it was the last time I did hear that we get about the average Maybe even a little more a day or so more than the average But government is ridiculous Just think of the money they could save they're they're paying out this money anyway Why not get the work out of the people And well anyway that would of course eventually come back to taxes But as far as income tax is concerned I can't complain too much about it I'm single I have no dependents or anything my children are all grown and they're out worrying about their own income taxes very true That's And then they tell you to well invest it in is it I R As or something and and when you turn When you turn sixty-five why then you pay the tax on it and the tax is a lot less But in the mean time you've got your money tide up in a low relatively low interest bearing investment it's not making ten fifteen percent like a business is today me I'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it Well you well do you do you need some help spending yours uh-huh Well that's my problem too I'm I'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that's going to get paid Uh-huh let me ask you something Did you get a catalog or something from these people You did I've everybody I've talked to has received one but I haven't gotten mine well anyway Ellen it was nice talking to you And until next time Bye-bye
