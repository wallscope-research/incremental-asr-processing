No I'm not that old either I'm only twenty-nine So social changes aren't that much for me either Well yeah that I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be Uh-huh relaxed and laid back and stuff and I think so I think so and a lot I think people are are used to now saying what's what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be Right Yeah I think so I think women have come out more too on on like child abuse and and the wife beatings and and like you said pro cho- pro-choice and whatnot I think that's become more out- outstanding than it used to be where women I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something No huh-uh Right Well I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom you know and all that stuff and you know we didn't have to talk about well basically her thing was just don't do it you know but I'm not I'm not naive to think that my children are not going to not do it It wasn't that long that I was that young And I've got a ten year old and you know he thought he knows about condoms and and he knows about AIDS and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about Uh-huh No I don't I think that's stupidity on parents' part that's sex is rampant and it always will be and and I think too noticing the kids that the fourth and fifth graders which is what my son is and stuff they they're just they're more they're very open the boys are very open because that's that's all I have is boys so that's all I'm around basically is boys but they talk about things that I my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know and and they sit down and they look at you right in the face and they expect a truthful answer You can't get them give them the you know Cabbage Patch answers and stuff They they that just does not go And they can tell me basically some things that I don't know But it it's interesting listening to them I think I think the social changes in them I think I see it more with that generation than I do with like our generation Yeah I do too I know well my son the my fourth grader he is
