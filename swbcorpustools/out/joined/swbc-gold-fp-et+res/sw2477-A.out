Okay so which what basketball teams are you interested in Uh-huh Uh-huh No they're more of a football team than they are basketball team Yeah You know that's true I don't think I've ever seen them nationally on basketball Uh-huh   That's not too bad Uh-huh Well I'm originally from the Saint Louis area so the only basketball team pro anyway in that part of the country is Chicago So I I do pull for Chicago of course this year is a good year to be a a Chicago B- fan I guess because they're doing pretty good Yeah yeah as far as college teams I know it's really easy to say but I've been pulling for Duke for about four years now so so I finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams Although I've I've really you know again being from Saint Louis I pull for Missouri but they're on probation this year so you can't do much about that But yeah I watched every I watched all three games of that And I was very pleased with all three games because Kansas you know I was pulling for Kansas on the other side so it was real nice to have the the teams that were there Of course I wasn't really I I U N L V kind of gave me the impression of being a oh I don't know a macho team you know they just didn't seem they seemed to think they were better than everybody else and and maybe they were but I was real happy to see them get knocked off So Uh-huh yeah Yeah Uh-huh U N L V yeah they they play the pro style is what I've always called it And yeah the fast breaks and and Right And U N L V wasn't used to that Of course I've I knew whenever U N L V went in at half time see I don't know if they were necessarily behind but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are and you know that meant that they had to play a second half and they they've not had to do that all year and That's right Duke's schedule was was so much harder than U N L V's that it it just made them a much tougher team overall and that had to help them a lot Uh-huh So do I take it that you think though that the Lakers will will win or Portland's pretty good Yeah Yeah No Well he's I don't I he he to me is not a center he's more of a a real tall forward  I think Magic does a yeah That sure is It I think that's going to be one of those that's that's won by the home team you know whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one I think Detroit's in that same that that same division No but as I heard Isaiah came back this week So that might help them yeah yeah That's true Uh-huh He's yeah but he's been yeah but he's been kind of up and down all year one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in and then the next time he'll you know he can't seem to hit the side of a barn So I don't know I'm I'm kind of I'm not sure about him this year Uh-huh Well that's when you do it Yeah Well the dark horses Yeah that's Yeah Well anybody who has David Robinson has got to have a chance anyway Uh-huh That's right Uh-huh  That's true Yeah Well then he's gone now so they don't have to worry about that Well I thought he was gone period I I didn't read the story but I I read that Well that might have been what it was but I I guess the headlines said something about him you know that the Mavericks released him or something I maybe I misunderstood what they meant Well yeah you never know Yeah but Yeah That's what I think Yeah Yeah It's coming up isn't it Portland Yeah Portland Uh-huh They've got two the two Johnson brothers or they're not brothers but I mean there's two guys named Johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something I forget how that works But like I said they're doing extremely good right now Phoenix isn't doing too bad So It it ought to be a real interesting play-off Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh When it's on the line Uh-huh Yeah that's true Well it's been nice talking to you All right Take care
