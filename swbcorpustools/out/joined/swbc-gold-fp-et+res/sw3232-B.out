Uh-huh no I don't have any children but I'm still going to college Uh-huh N C State well it's a lot of work My Bachelor's Uh-huh it's actually in computer science and I have a special interest in Voice I O No I'm actually from Amarillo Texas originally Uh-huh the service Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Ooh It would have played a major part in mine Uh-huh Golly Yeah luckily I've paid in state tuition the whole time Uh-huh Uh-huh The second thing is some colleges only offer the liberal arts and whereas like State they offer engineering courses so depending on what your major is or medical you might want to atteck- some attend somewhere like Tech and aside from the well some schools may even give you financial aid where another one won't really  Wow that's great Was it a Pell grant What kind of grant was it Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Wow Uh-huh  I'm not quite there's there's a lot of different organizations who who do give grants but I'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how much they you know they generally run Uh-huh Golly that's great another thing I've got a I've got a degree from another college and something that might play a part is the size of the college the smaller schools can give you a lot a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy and and they just give you a teacher's assistants you know instead of a scholar you get a T A and you don't get near the quality of education and as well the smaller schools often times don't cost as much yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh  I at State I think it's just a waste of somebody's money to go there it's really a shame because of you know the instruction I'd rather go to any other college you know in the state and I would definitely get my money's worth much better than State It's kind of unfortunate because they've they've just grown so big that they just don't care about the students any more Yeah they're they're bent on seeing how much land how much more land they can get and how much how much of the campus they can build up and yeah it's really a bad situation here
