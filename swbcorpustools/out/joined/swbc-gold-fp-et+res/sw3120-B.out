Okay Well did you go to college And where did you go Uh-huh Uh-huh I went to the University of Minnesota I am uh-huh Where do you live now Well I'm in Texas I'm in Austin Uh-huh I'm familiar with Plano I visited once or twice I love it I love it I really do That's correct I have two daughters but my oldest will be will be a sophomore She has her heart set on U T And you know having gone to the University of Minnesota I know what a big university is like And one thing that I did this summer which I thought might benefit both my daughters is my youngest daughter got involved in band and Baylor has a band camp So she went for a week and it was overnight and they lived in the dorms And I thought this would expose both of them to what it's you know like on a coll- a smaller college campus And my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school So I I I still think the exposure was good The reason I ask if you went to college is I thought well you know what were your selection criteria Did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford or you know there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision wow definitely Uh-huh how exciting Uh-huh that was That worked out very well for you Well then he should come to U T Uh-huh Large classes I went from a large high school to a u- large university and I definitely felt like I was a number it is a different feeling But that was that was my only option I just really couldn't look at anything else That was the one and only thing I could really afford other than a jun- you know a junior college which I didn't want to do So that's how you know my decision was made But Yes What what does he hopes to be a writer  she she has you know interests that are just you know going in all directions what she talks about a lot is theater which I think is okay Bethany let's be real she really is is pretty unfocussed at this point And I don't know she's taken a lot of French and she may end up doing something with that And I am a single mom so I've been and I made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married So I'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake And I'm you know showing them if you're strong in math and science kiddos this is one area where women can make some decent money You know I'm kind of really putting the practical application you know and and saying yet do something that you enjoy By all means go get that piece of paper you know Do you just have one son I see Well it sounds like he's got some really you know good strong ideas of what he wants to do
