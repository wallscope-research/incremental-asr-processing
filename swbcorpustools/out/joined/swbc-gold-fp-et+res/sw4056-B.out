Okay All right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I work for the University of New Hampshire and our benefits package isn't isn't quite as good in some ways you know overall I'm satisfied with it We don't have the vision care we do have the health care and the and the medi- the dental  No I work in I'm a on the professional administrative and technical staff and I effectively I run the telephone switch at at the University of New Hampshire so the the benefits probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the the very generous vacation time and sick time We get fifteen days a year sick time and we get twenty-four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty-four days a year time off Yeah Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I think the the health care of course is an important and has to be the single most important benefit and the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing you know I'm I'm a little disturbed about that but I think that's a national trend and I don't know that I don't know what the solution is to it It's bigger than just the benefits part Uh-huh Right yeah  Uh-huh  Right Uh-huh Well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental depending and and the cost between them is very is very little I think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan But it pays a substantial amount the examinations and and checkups every year every six months are free and it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses yes it is The benefits plan is different for operating for what we call operating staff which are considered to be clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which I belong to but the main I think the the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan But the main difference is in the the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's you know based on how long they've worked there That determines how much vacation time they get Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh College programs belong to this T I A A C R E F retirement fund Right and in the case of the University of New Hampshire
