Well lately since I have children I've cut down on having dinner parties but when I do I try to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare ahead of time I have one recipe for a really good type of a meatball It's called burgundy meatball and it's made with red wine and  It's it's really good and you can make it ahead of time and then make the sauce when you're ready to to serve it That's one of my favorite things to to serve Sure really Well I guess being from that part of the country Uh-huh Yeah Well how do make how do you you cook crawfish I in fact I just came back from the grocery store and being in Texas we don't have too many you know people that that eat crawfish but they had live crawfish on sale Uh-huh Don't buy them that way Uh-huh Okay Well I'll remember that Uh-huh Uh-huh When you were whe- when you serve it do you shell them and then serve em too Um-hum Sure Still have see that slash error Ooh slash error should be 'ba' Um-hum Does it taste a lot like shrimp Uh-huh Yeah Sure Yeah We have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks all the time And Yeah that's what I wish I had but in our family I am the one who who cooks And I I really enjoy it it's gotten a little more difficult with kids But I really do enjoy cooking And we we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot And before I had my second child we sort of had a contest going where you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me and we we was really a lot of fun and Yeah it did we we tried to be fancier or more courses than the other or it was a lot of fun you know it something unique you know and then we got into different themes you know whether it would be ethnic food Or sometimes it would be oh Oh I don't know maybe an outdoor theme or elegant theme or you know It was a lot of fun That's right it was fun and and we threatened to make the other two make us dinner one time Just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying I'm It does except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just just to make sure that they didn't have to do it again make hot dogs or some potato chips Uh-huh that's nice It can it can be fun I if you have the time But you know a lot of times it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it able to Uh-huh Yeah it's it's in the other room I don't know if we have enough time for it it's real easy one of the unique things in this it's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs an egg whatever seasonings you can just light so salt and pepper and chopped up water chestnuts which is something different makes them a little bit crunchy you need to chop em up real fine But it makes them crunchy and that adds something new to it And then the sauce is just made with bouillion cubes water burgundy wine and cornstarch instead of flour So it's not a it's not a thick rich type of a sauce it's more of a when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have Chinese food That kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that They use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies Shouldn't this be 2 slash units I'm confused by the capital letter on "They"  And it gives it a bit of a different consistency The meatballs you just after you form them fry them in a pan until they're browned on all all sides and then drain off all the grease then what I usually do is I freeze them And then when you're ready to serve them then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce And heat it probably you have to heat it up for a good if they're frozen you know it may take a half for them to thaw out But then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself Let them simmer in the sauce itself and it's real good Right And then freeze them Sure Uh-huh Yeah you'll meet friends invite invite the boss over and and friends at work Uh-huh Sure Oh really Well I I think we've covered the subject I got some interesting information about crawfish I was in fact It's good cause I was curious about that today when I saw those for sale I will I'm sure my husband will be surprised 'cause we were talking about them the other day mm- before
