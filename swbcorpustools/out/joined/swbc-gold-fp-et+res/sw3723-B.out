Ok Oh Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I understand that I have been trying to get myself motivated I had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor she had injured her back and needed a walking partner and I thought that would be the time to get going And so we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks and then she had to get back to work and which was traveling to New York and so she is not around And I just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning I don't seem to find time in the day time And of course it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Well more than weight of course I could lose lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds but I think more than that I also notice I just feel better when I exercise And that is something that I am motivated about now because I do need to get myself feeling better just in better shape But all the same it is connected to my attitude because I am not feeling as perky and good I am also it is hard to get my attitude to to get myself up there Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah And you have less chance of hurting yourself Yeah Last time I tried running with my daughter cause she is supposed to be jogging in P E and it felt good but then I had pulled a muscle in my knee Actually I hyper extended it or something and boy I was suffering for about three weeks later So and I have never had that problem before but I guess that age just starts to catch up to me It is showing up in the weirdest places is it Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Well I have got a dog now and of course she needs walking and that is a little less trau- burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her And I can put on the earphones to have something to listen to and Yeah yeah Yeah Yeah That is kind of an idea We we have over here in Plano a little recreation center that has got a walking track that it is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it any time of the year But I find it very tedious because I am watching the clock constantly and it there is just nothing else to look at and I actually get more tired doing that than I could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good There I could barely make a couple of miles
