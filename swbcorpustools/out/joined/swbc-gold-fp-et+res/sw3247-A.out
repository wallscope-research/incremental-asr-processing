Okay Capital punishment for myself I'm personally against it but we seem to have a duality of in this country where most states in theory have it but but but do not use it Okay well Texas uses it as about as much as any other state Texas is a big state here in Maryland to the capital punishment law people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment but no one no one has actually has the sentence carried out I'd certainly Uh-huh I think so I or affair number in fact I think that it it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available the sentence of life without possibility of parole has become a common one and is being being used much more I don't know the exact numbers but but yes prisons are overcrowded  Okay you're you're certainly in the majority at least in this country we are I guess the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment No at least not in Western Europe Probably not in Eastern Europe these days either there are many reasons for it but they they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates Well in part it's it's the nature of societies perhaps more homogenous society in many cases arguably if arguably is because of of of welfare state benefits Though I tend to be we tend to be skeptical Yes there's no question that that they that you know they have you know all kinds of cradle to grave programs welfare programs providing for everyone some way I I I however the question is is that making the difference Oh I think I think that idea is even even more common in Western Europe Uh-huh Me too
