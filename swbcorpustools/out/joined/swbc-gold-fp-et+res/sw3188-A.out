So have you done any painting projects lately really What kind of painting was it Uh-huh it was it Yeah uh-huh Uh-huh well what kind of paint did you use for the bookends Uh-huh So you can't use oil on wood so you had to go around with paint all over you temporarily anyway  is is that what you usually use in the house is latex  Uh-huh yeah I heard about that I guess a friend of mine had a well she she just started up a day care center and the one of the real strict restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff so she had that done But Well so to speak I had to paint this the inside of this warehouse thing  I would have put a slash after the answer "so to speak"  that you keep some farm equipment in and what I had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer and I had this big five gallon jug and it was like paint thinner I you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner but you just took a roller and put it on there and if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed So Yeah it was it used all of it I guess it was about three hundred yards worth So Well I guess it worked out It was pretty easy actually Well what about the trim in your house Did you have to do that Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah Did you have one coat or two Uh-huh Yeah that would be really time a time saver Uh-huh me I would have had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges and and then I'd have probably rolled it on I'd it would have taken me forever Yeah well the first time it'd probably would have taken me forever so Well how long did it take you all Uh-huh So there was two of you all Well that's easy enough  I think I could probably do it as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then I could do it Uh-huh
