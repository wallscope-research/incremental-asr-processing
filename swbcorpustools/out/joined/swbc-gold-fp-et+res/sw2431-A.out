okay Oh Uh-huh Yeah Sure you ready Okay Well it won't be too much longer because my husband and I are both going to re- retire And when we retire we're going to buy us a you know a new one and and get rid of the two that we have right now I do- I don't know we're either going to buy a pick up or we're going to buy a van Or we're going to buy an economy car how do you like that yeah Yeah It sure does I really would like to have something like that and I'm hoping that by you know that's like right now my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now But I keep saying lets put it off lets put it off because I'm hoping they'll get so many better features Well just like that air bag I think that thing is fantastic Because I've seen some of the you know like the head on collision type things when they had it and people walk away from it We had one here I guess it was about three weeks ago and the people walked away from the wreck with no scratches nothing You know a few bruises Uh-huh Uh-huh You got it I I tell you what I would not I would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door Well you know what the average person would you ever have thought of that now i- you probably wouldn't have Right because you always think I don't know maybe you don't but just like me I always think well you know these things must be safe but that's just like I don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist All these people were and and it it was on one of those kind of shows like TWENTY-TWENTY these people were like paralyzed and because it threw them forward but they were hooked at the waist and so it like you know did something to their spinal cord then they were like paraplegics Right Yeah Well tell me about your van Do you like it Uh-huh The reason that we're thinking about something like that we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to Florida and like I said we're not that old but my husband works for the State and after a certain amount of years you can retire And when he retires I'm retiring Well as soon as I get my quarters in I'm retiring period that's it you know no more As though Uh-huh And we wanted to travel well that was really nice traveling but you know I like to know more hear about more people that have things like that you know And see what they think of them the different kinds because I've only ridden in the one that's it shoot I can't even think of the name of it now Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well now this one that we went in it did <> baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in Ford A what Ford A Ford Ford what you remember <> He was trying to think of what the name of it was this was a big one it was a big one it has the front and the back and you know it has the back seat let down into a double a queen size bed and then it had the two swivels in the middle and then the two swivel chairs on the front and it was fantastic and it got good gas mileage but I don't know I don't really I don't I want something I can drive too you know and I was scared to drive that big van Well do you does yours have that this one had it where you know you would see something coming in the rear view mirror not the rear those little side mirror things and it would look like it was further back than it was Yeah does yours do that too I was wondering if all vans did that Uh-huh Yeah well see that's the reason we couldn't make really make them at first we were going to get a pick up truck with a camper on the back of it of it but then that gas mileage was just atrocious it's unreal it's it just practically don't get any Yeah And then he talked about a van and I said well you know I don't know I don't know how the gas is on most of these And another thing was that's the reason I said you know there was such a big difference you know in a little economy car but I said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along when we went somewhere But really and truly the safety features but I wouldn't get one that if it had the seat belts on the door now I wouldn't get it Period that would be good I think so too I don't think they should do away with the seat belts now I'm but I think you need the shoulder thing I think you need the thing around your waist but I think you need that bag to pop out too You know because I know so many people here that have been killed in head on collisions where maybe if they had had that that air bag they may still be walking around But I think it's fantastic I wish they required it in everything Every new car that came out I wish they would require it in it Yeah Well no because what they would do is that's what they're going to plan on you know they would have to do it the insurance company would have to do the same thing They're given like a ten year time limit where okay These cars I guess they figure all the old cars will be off the roads or something by the in ten years and then you know if you didn't have a car that had one then your insurance would go up enormously that's okay Okay Well you you too All right bye bye
