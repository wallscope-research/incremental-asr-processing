All righty What type of home do you have in Dallas Uh-huh good And it's probably typical of your neighborhood I'm in Plano just you know north of where you live And we live near Coit and Legacy in a relatively new development that just has gone in about two years ago So my home is typical It's a a brick home A two story brick home and it's typical of t- of the other homes in our neighborhood too Yes Yes The the one thing we did do instead of having a twenty foot living room ceiling we're from the north and we just couldn't stand the wasted space so we had them we have a high entry hall and then we had them level off our living room and dining room ceiling to nine feet so we could get bedrooms above So that way we we sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the area but we don't have so much wasted space And we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way Mine are actually the lowest in the neighborhood Yeah Yes Right I know Our air conditioner during the summer we it's over three fifty a month Yeah just to air-condition it so I have a master bedroom and a den on the main floor and then upstairs I have three bedrooms and I have I'm a writer and I work in my home so above the garage area I have a studio So it's not really a bedroom It doesn't have a closet and it and it's the size of a three car garage So that's where I work Yes yes So we this is our dream home and we just absolutely love it I Yeah we're we're really proud of it I just hope we never have to move again This is al- Detroit this last time We were there two years and we love it Yes and they're much much better constructed down south than they are up north too The Uh-huh The quality of the workmanship we noticed a tremendous difference Up north they just kind of throw them together Because we had homes built in in Detroit also and they just didn't care If the trim work didn't line up it's just that's just what you get Oh Yes Well the carpenter and painter and you know everybody the marble man were just there in the house everyday when we would come to check on it as it was being built and they'd say just look at this and you know they seemed so proud of everything they did And it really made a difference to us Yes Oh Yes Uh-huh That's important too Uh-huh Oh Yes Yeah ours is pretty much level in the two years that we've been there We're hoping it takes off again but I don't know with the E D S building and Penny's and everything going in up on Legacy we're hoping that brings in more people That's what we're hoping because we're we're just real close to to where that is So Uh-huh I hope so too Yes Yeah Yes I'm sure For that reason it can stay the same but But we love being where we are
