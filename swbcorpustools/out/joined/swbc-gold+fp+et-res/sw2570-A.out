Okay my hobby is uh sewing I've just uh started learning how to sew and uh I've taken some classes and I've made a few garments Do you sew at all Did you Oh Oh Yeah uh-huh Uh clothes are getting so expensive now in the stores and the quality is sometimes so poor that uh it really is worth while to sew Right an Yeah It certainly is and the patterns have gone up tremendously too the prices for them you used to could get you know a pattern for two or three dollars now they're like you know five six seven eight Oh no I'm not Huh-uh no the cheapest ones now are like maybe uh four or five dollars six seven and then you get into the Vogues they get up into twelve and fifteen and on like that Uh right now I'm just sewing for myself I do have two daughters that you know they're grown now though I wish that I had started sewing you know when they were younger And uh it would have helped me out tremendously But um oh I guess I have always tried to sew and uh I didn't like the way it looked so I'd never wear anything But now I have bought some uh new sewing equipment I bought the Singer machine and uh it really makes it look professional and I've taken some classes here in uh Dallas Yeah Right I know a lot of people where I work make their clothes there's just so many people sewing now days Uh-huh No I'm not that talented Right I have a sister that can uh crochet real well or knit I guess I mean knit And she knits things like hats and uh sweaters you know Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh Oh my goodness Yeah now they have the uh knitting machines that will do it for you Um Are you familiar with what a Serger is uh the Serger Sewing Machine Well you know when we used to sew we'd sew the seam and then we'd finish the edges and we would uh trim the seams and finish the edges Well this machine does it all in one step Right and it's cutting off the uh there are two knives and it cuts off the uh you know excess seam allowance Right And uh it really makes it look professional Especially on you know I mean from the inside you know how you look under under something that you've made and it doesn't really But uh the Serger really makes it look professional They're pretty expensive I like I paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine Uh-huh So since I bought it and paid that much for it I guess I'd might as well get some use out of it Yes I'm going to have to do it Right Yeah No No I play the piano Oh you do Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh well I'm not that great either I used to be a lot better than I am now I have played for uh the church choir and uh I played for the choral club in high school and but you know I don't practice a lot anymore and uh you know you get rusty You really I never thought I would get rusty but I'm rusty now Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah right Well sewing does takes an awful lot of time Yeah Yeah Yeah right on the straight grain and all that stuff uh-huh Yeah that's the part that I don't like too Yeah I like sewing up the garment itself I really like to do that but the cutting and all the even the cutting I don't like Well that's about it really it has uh four threads instead of the regular basic two threads And uh it No you can either use three or four of the threads Uh  it's kind of the stitch is kind of  like a knitting machine like they're loopers under the bottom and then there's a seam stitch and it's the loopers that form you know that edge finish And uh that's what really makes it look professional You can do a lot with the Serger though You can make uh piping and cording and uh you can use all kinds of different uh textures of thread Well yes but you have to use it in combination with a sewing machine You can't throw your sewing machine away you need it to do things like button holes and uh seams that need to be done on the sewing machine It's uh No it's a machine it's not exactly a sewing machine but it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff but there are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do Like you can't top stitch with it You know you can't do top stitching or um there's a few things that you just can't do with it It will also do a rolled edge um Gee it's just so versatile I rem- uh
