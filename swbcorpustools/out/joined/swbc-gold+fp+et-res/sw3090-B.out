No I don't use a family budget my father who is very old has kept one his entire life and I probably rebelled against it I probably should have kept one He keeps every penny that comes in and goes out on a very strict percentage Right I think it makes much more sense and I have recently uh gotten out of debt and everything and I will probably start keeping a little better track of it I just uh spent whatever came in and uh never knew what came in and what went out But uh about like the government runs Huh So I think it is probably better to have some sort of at least a record but my dad was so precise that I mean if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what it was spent And that was put over there and I mean of course he is from the depression and uh so uh you know it's his life but uh I think it would be smart if somebody would keep uh some sort of a plan that works for them Yeah it is I'm a historian and my father had kept them I think since nineteen twenty-seven uh but he burned the ones from twenty-seven to fi- I could not believe he did that so I took the ones from fifty-two on to the present but to have looked back into the twenties thirties and forties it would have been fantastic to see that But uh Uh-huh Oh I know Right I know well even in nineteen sixty-three I found a record that I had uh I travel in Europe a lot and what I had paid for hotels And a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now And I paid uh oh between four and five dollars in nineteen sixty And that's really crazy cause that's about thirty years ago Oh But of course it's just what the market will bear If people will pay two hundred then why charge ten You know Right right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Well then you never know how they will one they may flip flop when they get to be uh older The other one may be very careful and she may marry somebody and of course it would be good because you marry somebody a little loose then she will have that stability of watching uh You should have one in the house And I think Yeah Yeah that's about the way it is here if it had not been for my wife I would have probably been in debtor's prison if we had one So but what does you husband do now Oh Um Oh yeah You have to do it when you are in school My wife is still in school getting her doctorate and it uh and I have got Um Oh I know We had three in college plus my wife so that was four So we were both in the same Yeah Yeah That is the best one Yeah with education you can't take that away from you Right Sure Yeah that's true I have enjoyed talking with you Kathy Well if I had your address I would send you I am also in the travel business I do tours and I can take some real great tours to Europe So uh if you Yeah Yeah it's here in Dallas In the Quorum So I'm Jerry Hammond and I'm out at Brookhaven College so you could just holler at me there Yeah All right what is your last name K U E N Well good I will Oh well I know Zack Miller real well Well wonderful I will look you up in the fall then Okay Bye-bye
