Yes I saw that one What was the second one I didn't see that one Did you see those because of uh Julia Roberts or for uh the subject matter of the two Uh-huh Well I've uh I saw SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY and um I've seen uh well just recently um WHAT ABOUT BOB Well that one is uh it's cute but kind of far out comedy Yeah I uh am not one for the uh I don't need the suspense movies or the movies with lots of uh the horror movies uh trying to shake you out of your chair Um I'm not sure uh I saw it uh because my wife wanted to see it Uh but on the other hand I'm not sure I would have gone otherwise and having gone uh well it really wasn't on a theme that I was uh uh that into or as I say I prefer the light movies that uh my style of entertainment is comedy uh primarily and then into action films What Yeah you kind of have to like to be uh drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen Uh yes Uh it was interesting but I felt that one was a bit farfetched Uh in that well I'm trying to think of the other one I saw recently the one on um DEFENDING YOUR LIFE Well that was one where uh it's kind of like to me it's somewhat like PRETTY WOMAN the story line um if you accept a few of the basic starting points I guess the rest falls in place Uh it was hard to accept that uh this uh multimillionaire wheeler dealer uh would you know find himself and allow himself to get into that situation Yeah It's sort of a modern CINDERELLA type of story Uh-huh Yes Uh that was I enjoyed that one I guess I hate to be too surprised in a movie and in that one you could pretty well guess where it was going to end up You weren't sure exactly how it would get there but you knew where it would end up Uh-huh Yeah Well whenever she starts crying Well do you go to many movies more than once Uh-huh Uh-huh Well these days it's uh Well with some of the movies if you don't go to them within the first four weeks the movie may have uh left town never to show up again until it comes back in video So uh unless a movie is popular and stays around uh you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie So we have um well I think just most people have V C Rs now and we probably watch twice as many movies at home as we do at movie theaters Did you go to DANCES WITH WOLVES at least what I hear on that one that it's coming out a second time in a longer version even though it was a long movie It's sort of the uncut version At least that was some of the rumors We'll have to see because uh there was some talk about that I maybe it will come out this fall There we're sort of in the middle of the summer um season of a lot of new movies coming out but then there's these um periods like early fall before Christmas or early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again it uh will increase the revenues from the movie Oh I'd actually have to get a newspaper out My approach to movies is I kind of hear about them uh I keep track of them a little but you know ask me to name the ten that are out there right now and I'd have to say uh uh I don't know I just look at the newspaper before I decide to go and Uh it's kind of WHERE'S BOB or WHAT ABOUT BOB Yeah Because some of them uh they'll start in one area of the country and if they it's
