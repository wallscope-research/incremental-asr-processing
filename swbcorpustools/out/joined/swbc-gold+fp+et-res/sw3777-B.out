Uh I guess one of my favorite ones is CHEERS I always liked that one They're always so funny And I also like the COSBY SHOW Those are probably my two favorites You know I've watched that one time and it was really good but now that's on what Saturday night Is it Saturday night Uh-huh I can't Uh-huh Yeah I yeah I saw it one time and I really liked it but I just haven't uh you know watched it since Yeah Yeah the episode that I watched uh I liked him because even though he's a law enforcement officer you know sometimes the laws are kind of ridiculous and you need to sometimes break them to get your point across and for a good reason Shouldn't this be a separately labelled slash unit not a continuation of B26  And he seems to do that sometimes Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I thought it was a pretty good show I always like I like to watch like SIXTY MINUTES and TWENTY TWENTY Uh-huh Uh-huh I've never gotten into the STAR TREK era Used to be a Trekie huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Oh my goodness You must have some of their lines memorized Wow Yeah Uh-huh Twelve week oh I was going to say I hear a baby in the background B66 and 68--2 slash units  I imagine that keeps you busy Yeah Well we're expecting our first in about three months so I know we won't be watching as much as we do now Oh wow That must be tough It doesn't matter just a healthy baby Well we had a sonogram but we told him not to tell us so it's going to be a surprise Yeah Yeah it's not quite the same Yeah I agree I'm sure we'll be watching more uh children oriented television shows Oh I am too I still watch cartoons sometimes every once in a while when my sister comes to visit so Well you know it seems like a lot of them are a lot more violent than they used to be You know I remember like the FLINTSTONES and the JETSONS and those were just kind of good old cartoons Yeah Yep Yeah and they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh
