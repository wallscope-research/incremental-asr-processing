Okay um I'm presently living in a house uh first time uh we had the house built and so this is our fifth year in it I guess and uh um it was a real excitement uh to go out and select the house and have one made and built and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses And um as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in Dallas-Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home and they're good for about five years or four years and after that they start falling apart So I would uh not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in uh because they're overpriced uh but they're a cheap house If you can't afford something good you know they're good for that and um you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head but as far as the costs for what your getting uh the longevity of the house uh is not worth it How about in your case Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that's great that's great that's uh I've heard I have another gentleman friend of mine uh who had a house built as a matter of fact another guy is building one now he's been doing it for three years and the city's a little upset with him but I understand you save a lot of money off uh by doing that and uh Nothing wrong with that uh I'll vouch for that Um That was a big savings Well that's great uh have you been in it long Oh really well have you any plans to uh maybe uh expand or move onward I see well First one is always a bear We're having an architect friend of mine design a house for us and that can basically be put in any state you know so that's kind of we just got with him and told him what all we wanted and he's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it and he's certified and registered so least we know it's not going to fall in or something if it's built But uh I have heard that your approach is right you can actually go out and sub it even if you don't want to get hands on you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things and that's kind of the plan I have so I'm uh everyone I talk to uh I file in my little book and do other things with it That's great that's great Sure I can imagine If your happy with it that's all that counts That's all you only have to uh satisfy yourself and no one else Oh uh that's uh an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell I guess Well that's great Well yeah I guess that about does it Nice talking with you too Bye
