I was going to say my uh college is Northern State University in Aberdeen South Dakota and our head football coach Dennis Muir <> used to be an assistant coach at B Y U So I thought that was kind of an interesting coincidence Uh Northern State University in Aberdeen South Dakota I ju- in what major or what year International business Yeah And you Okay Well that sounds interesting How long of a program is that You know I read a study once and it said that uh like thirty-four percent of uh college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program it took me five years {D So } you get started and you change your mind or you want to pick up a second major if you're management you thought I'll take that marketing it's just only was three more classes you know and just doesn't happen that you get out in four years But My advice is uh look at the student to faculty ratio you know if you're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one I don't think you're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one Yeah it was about twenty-six to one Yeah Which is you know it's interesting but it's what I thought was nice is there was always time to talk to professor you know and they knew you You weren't just in their class you know and so you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever you know you could sit down talk to them about a problem They're always willing to help you out but I put that against uh my high school where we had uh a biology class of three hundred and fifty students and Yeah it was a biology lecture class and you know it just wasn't the same You're sitting there and you're taking notes and you know you got a computerized test scores multiple choice because there's no way they could correct uh you know a three hundred fifty person short answer test And it just wasn't the same you'd pass the teacher in high school and even in high school you could say high to your teachers unless you're in that biology class and they'd look at you like do I know you or should I know you Do you get uh a lot of tutoring or Uh-huh And you could get there and I mean he could have like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty-two people waiting to talk to him and you still didn't get to talk to him anyway Well what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college That's excellent advice Well it does get it You know you get to the point where I'm never going to get done You know I mean I was taking summer classes and let me get out of here But uh no that's good advice Even if you don't have your major decided on have an idea what you think you might want you know so you don't want management but you think you want business
