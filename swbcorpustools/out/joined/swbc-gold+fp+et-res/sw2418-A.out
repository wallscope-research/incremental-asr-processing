tough thing uh the salary thing T I doesn't quite always do it right Well what about our financial budget Well you should have a lot of information on a budget then if you're uh Well you deserve an honor for that a gold star for that I guess Right sure Well I guess I do I do have a long-term budget bec- I got a daughter in college and one going to be in college so that I've been thinking about that for quite a while Now monthly no I'll tell you a funny story about budgeting and I've been married twenty-six years and I did you know that the macho thing the man always did the bills for I don't know fifteen years or more and I got so sick of it trying to balance the budget uh one and I always tried to show my wife you know here's how you once a year I'd say here's how you do the budget in case I get sick or here's how you do the checks you know One day I gave her the checkbook and I said I'm not doing this anymore You do it you learn it and I've been happy ever since She does it all now for about ten years and I don't even she complains to me about it she threatens me to give it back to me and I said I've been a happy man since I haven't fooled with that checkbook you know So I know it's a big pain to try to do that Right Right oh yeah Yes I think uh that that is a tough uh we all seems to be that way Yeah Yeah you need to do that I'll give you a hint I don't know if you're a radio talk uh person listener Do you listen to radio talk shows Listen to Bruce Williams uh for financial advice He's on oh I don't know what he's going to be in Austin He's on five seventy here Inter- oh he's nationally famous He's a college graduate type guy He's been in all he's an entrepreneur and he gives very practical financial advice about cars very you know not nothing college level basic stuff His name is Bruce Williams he's on national radio Uh I don't know what it would be down there You might want to whatever your radio talk shows are down there he's on that channel uh it's five seventy up here And I'd listen to talk shows for everything for gardening and everything just when I'm doing chores and uh he gives a wealth of information very practical stuff and he will help you avoid a lot of little things uh financially Yeah there's a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget And I'm not expert again because I don't really do it monthly Right I did start a college fund uh I have one again at U T down there now her first year and she's almost gone through her whole college fund you know Sure go ahead Sure Oh no yeah right they give us ten minutes uh Uh the only advice I give you on college would be there's a lot of scholarship money out there My daughter got a little bit not much only first year she got about two thousand dollars worth and you ought to well as your daughters approach the college age uh start finding out about the scholarship monies because there is a lot of money out there and uh Uh band She got you know five hundred dollars at a clip through bands through leadership Uh there's all kinds of civic organ- organizations that will give you you know one shot money Uh you get a president's award if you're in high school doing cer- this up here in Arlington Uh there's a lot of and of course you score high on the S A T you can get you know two thousand a year you know or more You can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades she did very well in school uh but she only got first year money She got about two thousand dollars It was only five hundred dollars at a clip from this organization We called there were two or three people there was some little civic organization in Dallas that gave money away and only two or three people applied She applied and got five hundred dollars from that So look into that bit The year that they graduate you know before though you know while they're graduating there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything and they don't even have a dozen applicants because uh uh the kids are going off after the big money Uh of course you have to have some sort of record in high school uh of of achievement and everything but sometimes it's just uh like our band gave money away We're a band booster club we give uh two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids uh who we think were worthy you know so There's money out there Go ahead you can talk I want to chew up the whole line here Oh I'm an engineer uh in fact I'm working the night because of the cutbacks and everything Uh my job there were three managers jobs that were just dissolved and so they put me on nights I call this my recession job And I'm working nights just kind of covering uh shutdown equipment and everything and just being available here I don't mind Uh it beats being laid off and everything And uh you got to be a little flexible Uh in my old age I'm trying to just hang in there until I get my kids through school and then I'd like to teach maybe mathematics or something I'm trying to study for that now Right uh Uh-huh Oh yeah Right Oh sure Well it's tough right now for everybody <> Up here in the Dallas Metroplex it's awful Hey I've got another clue for you
