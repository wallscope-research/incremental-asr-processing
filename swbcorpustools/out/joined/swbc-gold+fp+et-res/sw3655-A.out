So uh what do you think about child care Right Probably find someone how come you wouldn't take them to a day-care Just because of the Yeah they seem to pass a lot of Yeah you kind of wonder whether or not I took uh Cammy to a oh it was a preschool day-care type of thing But I liked it some ways and some ways I didn't Uh I think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important And Well I think they had two teachers and I think there were twenty kids but I only had her going two days and most of the other kids were going more days so that was probably my own fault that she didn't Oh you know one thing I noticed is uh uh just they were trying to teach her to write her name and uh I didn't notice it until this summer when I was working with her that she would bend her wrist all the way oh not in a natural form Yes and uh I was kind of mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or uh tried to say look you're holding your she was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff but she was Yes And uh I hadn't worked with her on writing at all at that point She was four or three yeah uh it was last year and uh then this summer I got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on and I w- like I said I didn't notice it till then Because I hadn't worked with writing letters or anything and stuff like that No They never Course like I said I took her two days a week and maybe that was my main reason for taking her was uh just social skills more than anything else I felt she needed the s- just I didn't feel like she was mature enough socially and uh Uh-huh Oh yeah I think it would be hard to take them to people you don't know Preschool's a different thing but I think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know unless you have awfully good references Reliable uh people I don't know it's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long It is The older ones it's not you don't even really have any real worries because you know that they'll play with whoever's there and they usually adapt pretty well But uh Well and you know kind of their schedules and you know if they're upset and that type of a deal I don't know how uh people uh that have young kids working work full time do it really without being stressed out all the time I think it's well I don't know then on the other hand I think it's harder to stay home in some regards It's hard to always keep yourself feeling like you're doing something productive and at the end of the day your house still feels like it's a mess and you haven't got anything done and what am I going to fix for supper Yeah it's kind of hard to always feel gosh what is this important what I'm doing and No No It doesn't But probably people that take them to uh preschools and day-cares full time oh they would I don't know probably just feel different uh I just think it would be hard to do that full time I feel such a responsibility even when we go out for a few hours that are they driving the baby-sitter crazy and you know
