Uh I guess my feelings are that uh we almost have a universal health care system uh to a great degree except that now I read where we've left out about thirty-four million people And uh I don't know exactly how we're going to cover many of these people because I'm sure that some of them uh don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves so uh I have a feeling since I have just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get that this uh then becomes an obligation of the government because it's going to become an obligation of either state local or federal government anyway Well it seems to me that I'm paying anyway because or my insurance carrier anyway when I pay something the bills seem inordinately high And the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that It would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who uh employ these people and pay them uh you know subminimum wages or whatever were asked to share their fair burden of this too just as my employer is And myself I guess Well well who else is going to do this then I mean it's worked successfully in Europe I've heard all these stories about I travel extensively and spend uh maybe half a year in Europe every year and I find that the health care programs there uh are administered uh at least people I talk to with uh a great deal of integrity and uh people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree As a matter of fact if I'm injured or have an emergency when I'm say in Germany or France uh that I'm automatically taken care of I mean I don't even have to pay A- Well uh uh I know it I have a solution you see my solution even though I'm rapidly approaching uh the age when I'll qualify for Medicare and Medicaid I my mother and father both uh uh well my father's not living but my mother is and they are um of an advanced years and when I see the money that's poured down the drain on Medicare and Medicaid I mean the absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in and the extraordinary amounts I know that because those people vote I mean they're the ones who get out and vote that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal care The young people aren't getting the proper care that they need and nutrition I think and we're spending on these many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people That's right I mean it does seem like we're th- now I noticed just the other day in the paper that payments will be based not uh just on cost but on cost effectiveness So I gue- Well I don't know uh we'll see how that goes I think that was just a regulation that was up for comment but we'll see what happens Well listen uh I think I've exhausted my uh self on at least I've blown off steam of the way I feel about it Okay See you next time Bye
