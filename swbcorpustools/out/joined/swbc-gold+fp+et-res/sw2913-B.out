Gosh I like just about anything I think the last one we saw was uh TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES PART TWO Well we don't have any kids but we like them anyway Um we're late twenties No Oh gosh Oh It was it was actually better than the first one I thought What's the last movie you saw Oh when the topic came up I was asking my husband right quick what's the last movies we saw He said well GHOST and TURTLES I really liked it Not too awful bad Yeah Did you see PRETTY WOMAN Oh gosh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh once in a while when I'm home Yeah Okay Yeah it does Yeah I think you would really like PRETTY WOMAN it was really a it made you feel really good It was just a happy movie Yeah I saw that one I was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was Yeah I don't like that I don't see why they have to do that I mean everybody knows that the language is there so they could just ignore it and you know use different words instead I think But I think lately PRETTY WOMAN'S been my favorite I went and bought the video I've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times That's okay That's okay Now I haven't seen PRETTY IN PINK um does that have slash error Molly Ringwald br I think SIXTEEN CANDLES was the name of it I haven't seen it either I do Oh gosh Oh Huh I don't know Bu- Probably know him if I saw him I was just thinking another good one I saw not too long ago was um SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY that's Julia Roberts' new movie Yeah she's this one you know PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and a romance and this one was a lot more dramatic Y- well it was a mystery She disappeared from her uh husband who was abusing her Yeah yeah No it came out in the theater And I think you know around here it's all ready quit playing But I don't know if it's still playing any where else But it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat Oh okay because we saw it probably four or five months ago Yeah uh he was a real psycho in the movie it was scary Oh yeah boy I didn't like it No it was I didn't like the way it ended Uh-huh Might have been Michael Douglas Oh that starred in it listen Yeah it was Michael Douglas Huh-uh it was weird It was a different movie from anything I've ever seen Yeah Yeah that would be kind of hard for us we've only got one bathroom I don't know h- That wouldn't be too bad Get around Well did you see FATAL ATTRACTION I know it's going to be on C B S Tuesday night and that's kind of in a way you know how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff That's kind of how WAR OF THE ROSES was parts of WAR OF THE ROSES was funny but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling you know I've heard about that but I don't know what it's about Yeah I love Disney movies I mean they're some of the best that are made Oh go- I don't think so Nope I didn't see that So do I and a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something and you're not sure whether it will be any good or not so sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than Yeah now we saw that and they're coming out with a sequel to it It was funny and WORKING GIRL is really good That was good Yeah Yes I did that just reminded me of that Did you like it
