Okay go ahead Yeah Don't do it Well I tell you I firmly believe in exercising I think it's a I do it every day on a regular basis I Well I just got back from biking twelve and a half miles but this time of year you can't get much biking in Uh but every morning I use this President's uh council of physical fitness and uh uh it's worth doing and you can do it anywhere I travel quite a bit in my business and you can do it you know wherever you're at and if you do it I do it every morning uh usually after breakfast before I take a shower and get you know dressed you know to go to work And uh now what I do I mean I've done this for you know like fifteen years so you don't start at this kind of regiment you know I so what I'm telling you isn't something you go out and do and you'll hurt yourself Uh every uh it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because I do it all the time but uh I do twenty-five uh uh where you have your arms above your head and your body twisters touch you know left and right toe and I do uh ten uh right and left uh trunk twisters And I do uh about sixty uh bicycle uh leg thrust type things And I do uh twenty uh leg lifters on each side You know when you're laying on the floor And then I do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups and uh then I do about uh Oh yeah oh yeah And then uh thirty uh now if you did football like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you you know prone type things where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing and that takes maybe about thirteen minutes uh in the morning Well uh Years ago I used to uh referee football and uh to stay in condition I did that uh just as a normal basis and uh uh I tell you just by doing it uh well example this summer I was about fifteen pounds heavier than I wanted to be so I increased I do three hundred sit ups a day now but not in the morning I do a hundred then and then I do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before I go to bed I lost fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles and you know you can eat anything you want drink anything you want but you don't you know within reason you know you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being and uh I just you know you're ready to go at a I think it's really important Good Well that's why Chuck I think uh if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like well I like biking and during the summer I'll do you know at least seventy-five miles a week and when I really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty but you can't you know there's excuses weather or you don't have time or something like that But if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth you're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour And you get up a half hour earlier and once you start getting into that you just feel good and you look a whole lot better Unfortunately not and there's no way I can get her to like it's something you either just really want to do it or you can't talk anyone into it If you don't like to exercise you know it isn't going to happen I sure wish she would She's you know unfortunately overweight but she's a wonderful woman and you know no sense getting in arguments with anybody about it Well No problem at all And uh if you get one of these mats You know go to a store they normally have these exercise things these A B Cs of physical fitness on them One of my kids got me one of those for Christmas one year and uh it's just an exercise mat that rolls up so you can put it up you know just in the corner Well yeah you can do that but it doesn't Yeah it's a foam thing yeah Yeah and it's just about six feet long rolls up and I don't take it on trips with me you could but uh I don't mind uh you know if I do like sit ups I'll throw a towel down or something You know so you don't have the abrasive
