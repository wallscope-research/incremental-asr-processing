Okay Well I think that it varies on the individual basis Uh sometimes there is no alternative Uh you do not have uh uh family available or family that's uh you may not even have family you know who are around So sometimes it's not an alternative uh but I think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time Sometimes in a nursing home uh especially if it's after an acute illness To get over a or to rehab after uh an illness you know sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time Uh-huh Because too often the acute hospitals are sending them out much faster than what they're really able to so there is some good to it Uh sometimes too it's used as a dumb job You know well the families do not necessarily uh know what to do with them and they don't want to take the responsibility so they will put them in a nursing home So you see uh there's both sides to it too What do you think Yeah That's true I think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to there's not a choice because it's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home So that option sometimes is not available if they do not have uh either Medicare or insurance to cover it So Yeah and then there's also some that are set up for specialties uh I know some Unfortunately some elderly or have I guess it's Alzheimer's or where they wonder or uh confused or have some mental problem And you need a special nursing home for that You need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around and you need people who are trained for that type of problem Yeah so there's different types of nursing homes I think Uh-huh Gives her a little bit of her own independence but she still has uh a security there That's right and I've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active So it's not sort of like uh uh a sick place Yeah uh I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the uh elderly uh person who's going in and the family that's going to be uh effected by it and uh you know sometimes those choices can be made in advance and sometimes the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're
