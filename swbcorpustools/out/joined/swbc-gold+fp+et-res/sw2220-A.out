I was trying to think about some of my favorite people that I liked in music and none of them are recent right So I like Gordon Lightfoot do you know who he is And the Moody Blues and I like to listen to piano music a whole lot and Willie Nelson Yeah But not all country I don't like that when they start I don't know I just like Willie Nelson I guess because he's such a character Yeah My truck is broken down Yeah there's a guy have you ever heard of George Winston he plays piano I think he's dead now but he plays wonderfully I like that Very badly I've got a piano my mother got a piano and uh vowed that someone in the family was going to learn so we all had to take lessons and I was the one that did the least poorly so she gave it to me And it's sitting here mostly taking up space but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it It is real relaxing Yeah Oh so do I Forgot about that I said so do I I forgot about jazz Yes we've got about five of those I love them Uh-huh I'd never heard them before until I went in a music store and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it and I heard a piece and it was just so wonderful And then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it Yeah I mean you can just sit you know those little booklets that come along with it and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music my little boy has gotten so into it that he's identified the people that have written certain songs then he buys the pieces that have that person You know on it Huh I mean I don't even know who did which ones but he does Yeah Were you in the band So was I Yeah Yeah I like the Moody Blues Did you like them So what type Simply Red I've never heard of that Is it just instrumental Yeah Yeah Well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road We're going to go to Commerce and see a friend And then I'm going to go to Sulphur Springs Yeah where are you Okay So we're in Garland Yeah Yeah yeah Just because there's a friend up there not because there's much else For colleges Well they're not c- They're not going to recruit me anymore I'm through No more for me what do you do Are you going to go to East Texas for that That'd probably be pretty interesting I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week They had summonsed eight hundred people about four hundred showed up and it was for a murder trial This guy had supposedly uh strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose Anyway this is happened in nineteen eighty-three And they had us fill out a long questionnaire We stayed till about one thirty and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time and the trial won't take place until June And they say it's going to last about two to three weeks And this guy in front of me said I can't believe I was summonsed I was an investigator and I was tailing the woman that was killed Well then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been uh getting cocaine from his client and then selling it and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he's going to testify for the State against her so he'll have his sentence reduced Yeah the investigator Yeah he got off right away And I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that so I figure that that will make me biased and I won't be chosen Hopefully Yeah The death penalty slash error No aa I said that I could believe in it in certain instances but I'd find it hard to levy that against somebody You know Uh-huh Yeah But then when you're picked see I was picked for another murder trial before oh gosh and it's so hard because you know everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done and if you're trying to hold out you know there's so much pressure on you and you've got to come up with a decision
