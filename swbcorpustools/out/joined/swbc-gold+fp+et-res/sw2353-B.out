Well I know it's hard for young people to think about giving up you know their carefree years but people that I have known that have done that like from other countries especially from Germany and Finland um they have such a better more mature outlook on life and I think they're better people because of it they're much more responsible I know um the church that I go to um the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know they're encouraged to do that missionary work and I really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our society better Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh Yeah Huh <> Yes <> Yes Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I think so it puts you out on your own and in a time after high school um there's kind of a selfishness I mean teenagers in our country are kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and things like that and I think that it would help people to become less self-centered and to be more responsible when you're out on your own um thinking less of your own needs but of other people Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh no Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yes It would really um and I don't the people that I've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that they do military service which you know I don't exactly recommend but still they have benefited from it And um you know although I wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it has helped them and they are just a lot more mature than the average student and <> Uh-huh Well that's right A lot of people they flunk out or they just get so excited to be away from home they just spend all there time partying and they do a lot of things to themselves that we really don't want our young people to be doing and Um Yeah Uh-huh Be- because we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and um having people <> But you know our like in our church it is your free to do that or not you're encouraged to do it because um you know it helps you and of course we think it's helping other people And so Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh And they're preoccupied with drinking Uh-huh And Uh-huh That's true <> That's really true Yeah Well I don't know how that would ever happen here but at least um Oh really Uh-huh Huh Well I have seen a big change I think in high school kids that my relatives <> and friends that um I know when I was in high school I had an idea of what I really wanted to do with what I was going to study and at least I had some interest in a lot of the youth that I come in contact with they say oh I want to be a doctor I want to be a lawyer Why Because they make a lot of money And they don't have a goal they don't have a goal they don't have an interest in their own field of study They're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash Uh-huh Area Yes Yes There's just too many people Uh-huh That's right Not enough people want to do that for uh because of a service that they could provide You know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to be rich Uh-huh That's kind of sad Well anyway Well I guess I better go Well good luck to you I enjoyed it Thanks Bye-bye
