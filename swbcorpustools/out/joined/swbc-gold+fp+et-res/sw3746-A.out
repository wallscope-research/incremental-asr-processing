Okay uh what kind of hobbies do you have Lori Uh-huh Uh-huh Where do you play golf in this area Uh-huh uh do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf Oh I was going to say that could be difficult Uh-huh I think that might be true I don't like pulling a cart on Firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path That is the reason I don't play over there I like the course but I don't play over there because they don't uh you know don't allow you to pull a cart And I don't think a cart damages the turf Uh-huh Well I guess I could use a card too I live uh uh very close to the Firewheel Golf Course Yes I live in northwest Garland Right up there near the golf course Well in the last two years I have not played very much golf because I am involved in Boy Scouts So uh I have children Boy Scout age I have two boys that are boy scout age and uh so I am very active in Boy Scouts so I would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby But I but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get to use them again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college That's right Lessons are expensive though Well they would probably never make it then because I don't think uh I only took lessons for golf when I was in college Uh as a course for P E you know so I could graduate But uh that is the only time I think I have ever really taken golf lessons and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual I took one lesson one other time Besides that uh I just uh try to make the club hit the ball I don't want to play strike out you know But I have fun doing it uh you know I have some good shots and some bad shots So you said you work uh in the gardens too Do you have uh special flowers My wife had uh just put in a bunch of I want to say they are pansies She put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants And they have been we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine That is when she did I think Uh-huh Do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time Will they make it through the summer sun Well Well that is good
