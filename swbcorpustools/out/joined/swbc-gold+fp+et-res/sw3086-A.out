So do you have P Cs Uh-huh Uh-huh Um well I sort of own a computer We have two P Cs at home but neither one do we really own Um No both of them are sort of work related and Yeah that's the nicer way right No no Um actually I'm doing consulting right now because I just had a baby and my husband's working at Bell Labs but he's really from France and these computers actually are from France One of them's a Compaq it's a three eighty-six and the other is actually a I B M P C compatible it's a three eighty-six I guess it's twenty-five yeah <> three eight six twenty-five C maybe I don't know no we don't have the we decided not to get the which is actually another loaner one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing and Um well I actually do some work working at M I T and at NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington and then I worked for Dragon Systems for a while Um well it depends it's very different in the different places but Yeah yeah Program related research related and I work in the speech field and I do a lot metacoustic phonetics and looking at the acoustic characteristics of speech and I do that type of stuff typically for other people and like here we use the P Cs to do that Mostly I use it for writing papers and things like that Well more uh do you know Latek Word text processing so I don't use I mean you can call it word processing but I don't usually use a word processor to do it and we don't have too much standard software Like we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all So we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that We use it more for just writing programs when we need to or um doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing and also just as a terminal and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that Uh neither one has a modem but we have a modem Neither one Right Yeah we have Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh So that was it Oh I didn't hear it Do you hear the beep in the background Oh that's an ambulance or something going on here I think I haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually In Manhattan Yeah I'm at home Uh-huh So it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal I mean because there's a lot of background noise that you know people can hear So it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up Um yeah and often times that I can't do this much later than now between sort of like six five thirty and six thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud I can't even hear the phone call Uh about twenty after four Okay yeah we're Eastern And um did you ever try using like Prodigy or any of those systems Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah I've never tried using that I don't know too much about it What about did you use commercially available software or Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I've never used D Base um but I've heard both good things and bad things about it Uh-huh Yeah people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use Uh-huh Uh-huh Do you think D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more Or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days But uh yeah I didn't mean compatible I meant comparable My brain is going to mush And what do you work on at T I Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right
