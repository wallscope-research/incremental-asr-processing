Yeah I I don't have any children so but I I have a lot of friends with children and I know they spend a lot of time with them Which is good you know  Yeah ye- ha- have a lot of values I love that Do they have children Oh that's wonderful Oh that's neat That's good you know I like to see that You know I have uh some friends that uh first of all uh the girls joined they have two girls one joined the Girl Scouts and the other was in the Brownies and then the mother got involved as a leader and then all of a sudden the father was getting involved with doing nature hikes for them and working with the Girl Scout camp he- here in Dallas and then going out to uh Betty Perot camp and working with the horses and stuff and they're gone a lot and they take their girls and they go away for weekends and in the winter time even you know to do work with the Girl Scouts and I think it's neat You know they've really become very much involved in in just that one organization which the organization can use the help too So I I wish I could see more of that you know Oh Ugh those are neat cats too They're really nice looking cats I have seven cats but they're all mongrels Well they're the ones that need the homes You know mine were just all uh strays in the neighborhood Little baby kittens dropped and stuff and it just kind of built One at a time just kin- I couldn't you know One time two of them came at once and I can't turn a hungry cat down So you know and the last one that I pic- was here uh the kids brought him over and said he was injured and it was winter time and I said I just can not have another cat I just can not have another cat and I looked out there and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all and I said I can't stand it I brought him in so Those are my children We don't have very many activities but Ha ha lots of luck Is she spayed Oh yeah real maternal She'll eventually I mean mine you know I have five males and two females Everybody's spayed everybody's neutered and we still have a scrap every now and then Nothing real bad you know a slap here and there but uh they put up with each other and they will eventually He- her nose will be out of joint for a while and she'll hiss and growl and slap every now and then but they'll she'll finally accept it You know they really don't have any choice In my household we have a little bit of uh a fight for whose boss I mean a male cats are are re- you know real territorial and so that's the big battle here you know of whose whose top dog we- top cat I guess You know but uh we- I don- I don't know I don't have a problem with it I think they just learn to accept And I have two dogs too and they've slapped the dogs around too Every now and then so Yeah but she'll accept another cat eventually As long as you make her feel uh like she's still loved and everything so And they'r- Oh my gosh Yeah Three hundred and fifty dollars {whispers} {Still whispering} Ugh house payment That is a lot of money I don't let mine out anyway but I let two of them out just in the back yard every now and then but my cats are insi- I'm afraid you know the neighbors will people throw rocks at them and people run over them and I I just you know I just don't I know so- and and now they've lost the desire Most of them don't even try to ge- you know to go out I just have two that drive me crazy that I let out in the back you know but I won't let them get if they start going in the front and stuff I bring them in You know I just worry I guess I'm too protective but you know I see these cats that are wandering around the neighborhood and too they can catch diseases really easy just by touching a nose to another cat they can contac- leukemia feline leukemia so We know we try try real hard to keep them healthy Oh how neat People do it for their children I mean why not Well you know why not why not Yeah Yeah well if you're off off of a you know away from a road and You're off of the main road you said Away from a road you know and you keep an eye on her it's probably okay I'm just real I don't know I guess I'm in a neighborhood and it's it's just real tough on animals here you know Whe- I every time I see one run over I just you know it makes me sick so you know but anyway we kind of got off the subject of children except that I consider them my children Yeah Oh no In in her little bridesmaid dress Well I'm sure it's been done I'm sure it has been done Well they have weddings for dogs now and cats and you know they have all that parties for them where they dress up I've seen it in magazines and stuff where you dress your animals up and take them to a par- I haven't gone that far I'm not that bonkers You know my cats do not wear clothes an No  We- d- do any of your friends have have uh older children that they do anything with Do do you have friends with older children or do they just all have young kids  Oh see there she needed that didn't she You know it must be hard when you have a lot of children I you know to ha- I was an only child my mother was an only child so I you know I wasn't raised with brothers or sisters and I always got all the attention so I wouldn't know I think I would be extremely jealous or would have been had there been another child in the family Tough it must be tough Yeah yeah We- she she's the middle one So she's never been the only one so she really doesn't even know what it is to be the only one Yeah that's tough you know
