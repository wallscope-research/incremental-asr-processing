Right Right Yeah I'm sort of mixed on this I think that the answer may lie uh not in so much a uh national kind of medical thing that li- like England has but more of a um national insurance uh sort of clearinghouse or whatever I think that uh too many uh the problem right now is that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through and I think you mentioned Canada I think that they have a system where uh the government deals with I mean you go to whoever you want but file through one particular uh setup and that way they are able to reduce prices because you know it's all one centralized thing <> Uh-huh Right Uh I was listening uh on the radio the other day and they were talking that something like this I think they were talking about the fact that um the money that could be saved um in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider um uh could they could make it provide health insurance to people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save <> Right Right Yeah H M O <> Yeah and they're fairly expensive I was on an H M O uh up until last year uh through work And it was I forget how much I paid a month but it you know is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care And uh the reason I quite was uh not because I didn't like it I really kind of did Uh the reason I quite was just because a certain doctor that we enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that H M O so my wife decided she wanted to stay with that doctor so we went to the medical insurance that we have here at work and uh I like the convenience of the H M O in a certain respect because uh even though you're once you find the doctor that you like it's not a problem You know a lot of people complain saying well I don't want to uh have to be told who I need to go to but you know if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference Because you can you know if you find someone you really like and then we did find several good doctors And um like you say it's uh five dollars an office visit And um my wife was in the hospital had our daughter and I think her total bill was around three hundred dollars for everything Uh that included uh you know the doctors the time the hospital an- everything Delivery room and everything including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay but that was still included in that cost so It's really nice because their attitude is different than a regular uh uh health insurance uh in a H M O you know they're trying to prevent a problem by keeping the cost down at the front end you know and have you come in you know they charge five dollars a you know pop you're more willing to go in and try to take care of a problem before it grows big <> Yeah <> Right Yeah I really liked it my wife and I both did you don't have to worry about filling out forms uh you know for reimbursement and all or you know getting paid eight percent of whatever You just pay the five dollars right then and then you're done with it Uh-huh Right Right Well you know they're also p- take- they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay You know they get uh a lot of uh people who just have to be there and can't afford it and so they know they're not going to you know get money from them so they have to absorb it somewhere else Uh-huh Right Right Right Right Right our insurance uh is doing something similar where they're also going to mor-
