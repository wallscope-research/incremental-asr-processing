Okay um well the first thing uh what do you think you would offer as far as uh information about selecting a school Uh-huh Yeah uh do you feel that the um depending upon the field I know there are some fields which a person should go to that school all four years but I know there are some fields where it's really not necessary Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah What was your degree in Political science oh okay Well I know I'm going to school right now and uh I have a friend Uh U T D University of Texas Dallas I know That's where Texas Instruments is Um something I think that I've noticed that I have a friend I think if you're going into like uh law or medicine a very particular very specific field even engineering you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public um institution And uh it's a lot cheaper my parents made a mistake uh in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years And she found out after that she said you know my parents they really wasted a lot of money This is about twenty years ago But uh well right now I just I mean as far as selecting a school I feel that uh a lot of it depends upon the major Uh-huh Uh-huh Okay Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Right Um Yeah yeah I'm pursuing what's called an interdisciplinary field I'm a speech therapy major and fortunately I have a good medical background and Yeah it's actually turning out to be more useful than what I thought And um I also have a good languages background linguistics And some psychology So it's all working together The only field I'm not familiar with really is education which requires about four or five different fields really So it's a Uh-huh Well Oh so you are a disgruntled graduate student Oh Yeah Bah humbug I think yeah there is I think uh law would be a fine profession fine field to go into Um I know one time I was in a political science class and you know talking about fields people going into different fields I made an off the cuff remark about lawyers about their integrity being questionable And I mean oh that was like a can of worms No there was a woman she said <> my best friends are lawyers <> and you know all this and it was just Yeah I know Or Jewish it used to be Jewish you know Yeah I know it's but Yeah Yeah I have a friend she's going into law another friend going into law and she's I'm really concerned about you know she's just going to be you know what's going to happen when she gets there You know all of her dreams will be dispelled Yeah Yeah I think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful I see that happening Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I went to a language school and it was an I guess uh United States institution I was military at the time And I think probably the biggest Huh I was in the Air Force Yeah yeah for myself I mean I think that military experience was fine I just wish that there was something else that I could have done you know with Yeah what was your job Uh I was a linguist Um In Tak Uh no I wasn't No no I didn't go flight crew Matter of fact I didn't make it completely through that field I was in intelligence school and about three weeks short I didn't make it I sort of washed out Yeah after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training you know it's something you know I think that's why you know children really need to think about the field they're going into and I mean spend a lot of serious reading I mean not just thinking about They actually should do some reading and they should study it Yeah I think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school I mean they find out just how much of a people person they are Oh and I tell you what I worked at McDonald's as well and I can tell you one thing there are just some people that I you know you just came to the point where I mean and oh I eventually worked as a lab technician and I worked front desk And I mean somebody could walk in the door and I knew exactly what they were going to do and say Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah that's good I was just wondering um getting back to the school thing I almost wish that there was something
