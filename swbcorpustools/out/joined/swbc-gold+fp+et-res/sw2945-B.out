Where are you from Tina Yeah uh-huh I have two children I have a seven year old and a three year old uh so I try to spend as much time as possible with them Well um we do a lot of things with them you know Taylor my youngest is or my oldest is in school and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that was it a big change in your life to uh have a child Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh uh-huh What do you do during those days Well you said you worked a couple days a month though what do you do Oh are you Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah I understand that yeah They really grow up quick Especially at that early age But my wife was uh she worked part-time when my oldest was little and now she's staying home all the time but uh that worked out really well because it's a big transition I think to have children You know to go from you know nothing you know if you want to do something every night that's fine but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore so Yeah yeah Yeah I agree with you I think that my wife leaned that way and I'm really glad she did and you know I'm glad she's staying home but you know I know there are some days when she wishes she was back at work Yeah Yeah well that's why I'm glad my wife did too 'cause she worked either two to three days a week and that got her out of the house and yet she'd get to spend you know three or four days with Yeah yeah and so Yeah I do to I agree but then when you start having two of them it's you know a little bit tougher because you've got to make a little more money to make that payoff and stuff are you from the Maryland area Really Um uh I'm in Dallas Texas Yeah so uh I've lived here like eight years or so my wife's from Fort Worth But yeah I work for Texas Instruments Yeah that explains it doesn't it Yeah yeah Yeah what's your husband do Uh-huh Oh Oh yeah I'm sure it does Uh-huh Yeah Yeah what uh my wife did some teaching at uh like a private tutoring place A Sylvan Learning Center this year and so that got me to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff you know 'cause normally if they need something they just go to mom No matter what it is I mean I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them but it's so much easier to go to mom I guess they get used to it So but you know we'd go to the library and do things like that yeah but Uh-huh Oh yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh it really does because I think you know you grow closer uh was your husband I mean naturally a child I mean had he been around children or Oh Uh-huh Yeah yeah Yeah Yeah yeah Yeah I understand I you know it's hard because you know then you're not getting to spend as much time at home I mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to So yeah that's a tough situation but then again you know some you got to do what you got to do you know to get along too so Uh-huh well like I said my wife normally feels that way there are days when uh I come home and she says here take these kids I'm getting out So she's had about enough during those days But for the most part you know I've really feel like that's led the way that you know we- jus- like what you said with the cost of living and everything I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary and won't And so I think that's tended to lead to a decline in families and family values especially And I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that you know we need to do something about but I don't know what Yeah Yeah would you have said that a couple of years ago do you think Uh-huh Uh-huh it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child Uh-huh Well you know in the next year or so you'll see so many instances where you know he'll mimic something that you've done and you see you know everything I'm doing he's learning from and you think if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care You know that's how they're developing their patterns And I think a lot of people either don't care or don't realize it you know That's Yeah Yeah eventually Yeah it's true Uh-huh Yeah Yeah plus I think it becomes part of you too I mean you get to stay home I mean it's not just for him but it's also for you because you're both kind of bonding together there too I think so Well it's been nice talking to you Okay good luck Okay good-bye
