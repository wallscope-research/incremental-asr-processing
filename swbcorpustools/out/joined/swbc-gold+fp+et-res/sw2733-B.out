What kind of cars do you do you usually drive Oh my goodness Well we're we're we're sort of sort of a General Motors family I guess that's the way we were raised And uh uh we were overseas with T I for a number of years and when we came back we suddenly find out we've got five licensed drivers in the family Yeah and four cars and we bought some year old cars from National Car Rental At least two of them We bought an Olds Calais and a Buick Skylark Uh for you know they each had twenty-one thousand miles or something like that Turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that Uh then we've got an eighty-six Chevy Spectrum that we bought new My daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her And we've got a eighty-four Toyota that we bought used So we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers It's like musical chairs You're one short And uh but you know it's interesting the two even though my dad was a Chevrolet man forever and ever and ever and we were in the retail milk business and he had all Chevrolet milk trucks and and we bought automobiles and all that it was almost like and a Chevrolet dealer was our friend and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a but a Chevrolet it would be like going and spitting on his grave But uh as we got older and got away and then we thought well you know you still could buy General Motors products and it was probably not that bad But uh we lived in Malaysia for T I in nineteen uh eighty-one two three and four And and of course you don't buy General Motors products over there But we bought a Volvo and I have never had a car that I've loved more I just can't afford them here Uh but I I just loved that car And uh we bought a uh we lived in the Philippines for T I in eighty-five eighty-six and eighty-seven and we bought a uh Ford Telstar which is somewhat similar to the Taurus It's sold in uh in uh the Far Eastern coun- uh Far East countries more than here But we really liked that And have you had experience with cars other than the ones you have Um Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Oh yeah The b- the big Yeah Sure sure Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah Yeah yeah it seems that something goes every month And I'm afraid we're going to be in that in another year with all of ours you know we got three eighty-sixes and an eighty-four And we'll probably be there with all of them You know it's the same thing you know I don't know whether uh you classify the Skylark and the Calais as well I guess they're intermediate Uh but uh we went on a family trip to Massachusetts and there were five of us and five five of us never go anywhere together here Every- everybody's heading off in their own direction And I rented a Buick Le Sabre and it's the first big car I had since I had my nine passenger Impala station wagon from seventy-six to eighty And it made all the I I had forgotten what driving a big car was like It was just nice It floated Oh yeah Yeah Yeah yeah yeah And uh you know I've read I'm in the quality business at T I I'm a quality manager and we're we're uh we deal we sell I'm in the semiconductor group and we sell to uh Ford Chrysler and G M uh G M Delco And there is a amazing I am just uh really impressed with the with the quality consciousness that the tho- these companies have put into their procurement and it's I it's come out as a result of the competition from the Japanese And uh uh I and you know we used to think Ford products were tinny I mean I was growing up I was taught when I was growing up you know that that that real people bought General Motors products and peons bought Ford products But just with the quality requirements that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants and they're really uh uh stressing this partnerships in quality and you know G M and Chrysler are doing that but I really think Ford's got a leadersi- ship position in this right now And I think it's showing up in their automobiles Their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now And uh uh we went to uh Austin a while back to a basketball tournament and we were going to be meeting some of my wife's relatives down there so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down we'd rent one and we went up to the local Budget and we were going to get a Olds eighty-eight or something He said I'll tell you what for a dollar a day more I'll give you a Lincoln Town Car And we drove that down and I hated to turn that back in We had that for three days And I absolutely loved except I couldn't want to have to park it in tight places all the time Uh but I absolutely loved that automobile And you know it wasn't that I'd driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon but on the trip down and back I filled up both coming and going so I knew what I actually got on the trip and it was about twenty-four miles a gallon Uh and you know we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it let it float And it was pretty nice Are are are you planning on getting any additional or other cars Um Oh yours is small  Um Oh yeah Yeah You got another another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them Uh we've got probably we'll get something in the next couple years My son will graduate from high school this year and and he's going to go to Richland College one year behind us it's right in fact uh our house is adjacent to the Richland property He wants to go to Texas Tech and he's probably going to have to go to Richland a year to get some grades in order but uh the next year when he goes out to Tech he wants a pickup and I want a pickup I may get one and not let him have it But we have been looking at these red Chevro- they they're very popular around here These uh uh red Chevy pickups and uh we'll probably do something like that uh uh incidentally uh uh I don't know uh the uh the Credit Union has got a deal now where you decide what you want and you call this number and uh they go negotiate the price for you And and or or send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal and uh my boss just bought a Chevy pickup and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way Yeah And uh uh you know you you figure out the options go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and and tell him what you want and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy a certain person at that dealer's place So I'm going to try that the next time I buy one And and so you know I can go around and comparison shop and see if I can get a better negotiation on my own But once one thing that's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating Yeah And for that price We'll go somewhere else Yeah Yeah And uh and I I think that's probably the way you've got to do it When when I was young I went in and bought a uh or made a deal on a sixty this is nineteen sixty I'd first come to Texas and made a deal on a sixty red Impala convertible that I just loved and this guy gave me this deal you know I told him how much I wanted to pay and for every fifty dollars he'd have to go in and check with the boss and then I'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate uh we would go ahead and buy Uh uh if he could get this rate I promised to buy and I left there on a Saturday afternoon just totally exhausted I I was only twenty-five years old or something I I left there and I I uh I'd never done this before because I'd always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from and uh uh so I I got back and a salesman that lived in the apartment had asked me uh uh if he'd heard I was going to get a car and asked me what I paid for it He said well hey uh before you go buying anything he says call this friend of mine at Will's Point There was a guy that owned a Chevrolet dealership up there And I called the guy and made an appointment to come up Monday morning and just driving fifty miles out of town it was a difference and I mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty-five hundred is all we paid for cars in those days And uh uh so I called back the guy in Dallas and I told him that I'd left him a check for tax title and license and everything and I said I want to cancel my order and and don't try to cash the check because I'm going to I've stopped payment on it already and he says oh somebody's taking he said what did you get a deal for Bill And I told him he says somebody's taking you for a ride And I said no somebody took me for a ride last Saturday And uh uh and I I find that uh and for the longest time then I drove up to Will's Point and and the and the fellow died since then and and some of his relatives have taken over the business and that but and since then I had
