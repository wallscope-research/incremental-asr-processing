So what is your opinion on drug testing Well yeah it's just not the com- you're talking about company's liability uh if the company is liable for something that that a employee does while under the influence of a drug you know then by all means they should have the right to minimize their liability And there's also the case about just uh uh health and welfare of the uh employees If a company has a healthy work force their insurance rates are low And not only low there's all sorts of a uh financial benefits associated with you know having people file fewer claims being sick the whole question that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy I don't think anybody would argue with that Right Right Well wel- the ques- Right The question becomes what do you do about somebody <> who tests positive D- that's where the real sticking point comes in It's not I don't think there's any problem with testing people It's what do you do with the information Right Right Well yeah I think clearly the person who is the line manager the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing That should go to an entirely different uh agency within a corporation Uh
