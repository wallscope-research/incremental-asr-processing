Okay I guess we're supposed to discuss the uh school system That shouldn't be too much trouble for the two of us Right Right Uh-huh Uh-huh That's really sad isn't it Right Well just recently in the paper here were articles about students uh working High school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades But then the follow-up the next day was I was kind of glad to see because it said that you know yes but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that you know handling a job was very possible You know and that it seemed to have more to do <> with other factors You know like what are their plans after high school you know And what's their home situation You know that Right Right Right Sure But there can still be an attitude of you know this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now but the most important thing is still <> you know getting your education Well when they said the topic you know of what's wrong with the public schools my first impulse was <> it isn't really what's wrong with the public schools It's what's wrong with families And society in general Right Right Right Right Yeah Huh Yeah Well uh you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor And that's just really not enough And I was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school and they said oh we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are you know at a tougher and rougher age and all that But you know part of my feeling is that if you help them to work through their problems while they're littler then they won't have as many problems up there Really Yeah Uh-huh they do that here Uh-huh Uh-huh To change yeah Right Yes it certainly is Yeah That's right <> Yeah Right I'm on that um campus strategic planning committee for my school And uh one of the uh you know oh they have all these different names for things strategies and all these different things But anyway one of the key things was that we believed that the public education is the best <> economic value Then I think they decided to strike economic Anyway you know the point was what happens when public education fails You know will then people go to private schools You know well what kind of a situation do they get there and what are you know and what kind of state are we in if most people are going to private schools Right Right Uh-huh That's right That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh <> Yeah and one of the Plano school district's you know goals is that they will graduate every child uh that is here in the ninth grade I believe it's something like that it's worded And uh I don't know Right That's so important Oh gosh Well That new movie out I um really a frightening situation I guess we're both lucky To be in situations and schools where we don't see that My folks talk about it a lot in Illinois My mother was is was teacher for years and years and uh they live in Peoria Illinois and their talking a lot about you know the school situation there too their should be they're So well shall we wrap it up I think we have to So I'll see you when we see you Uh-huh The reason that I wasn't at church and we went to hear uh James wind ensemble concert they left this morning for uh England Isn't that wonderful Uh-huh And uh the university <>
