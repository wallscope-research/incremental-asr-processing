Wondering how you keep up on the news Uh-huh I get the WASHINGTON POST and that is a pretty big newspaper and I think that's almost exclusively my first of the news Though I have the radio on when I go to work I don't think the news usually hits because I'm not going right on the hour You know Right Uh-huh Right I think that you know we've resolved the issue and that's what we were asked to do Right Right Oh okay Well thanks for discussing it Bye-bye
