Let's talk about the Middle East situation Now it's all over with you know I don't know I understand that the U S is talking about leaving more of its planes and things over there Uh I guess uh they're anti U S in that region and now they're you know like Syria and Egypt you know had some pressure against the U S but now they wouldn't allow us to have a base in that region but now I think they are rethinking that That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right right They get so much of our money from oil anyway No no Yeah I think that's a nice gesture on the Kuwaiti government part to do that and a few people I guess will make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth Right Go over there and rebuild all those I think it's such a shame that the Iraqis had to just go destroy everything I just I mean what good is that If I can't have it you can't have it you know that sounds like something a little kid would do You know That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh The deal with the uh supporting the Kurds Right right the cease-fire Right Right Uh-huh Yeah to help out Yeah Maybe supply some arms or something Yeah I think Bush has handled this whole situation quite well He stood up to the bully and didn't back down uh and uh Saddam Hussein miscalculated all along thinking that he wouldn't commit U S lives and forces and monies just to liberate a little country And uh then he underestimated his ability to wage a war with us I mean one thing when we all came over there and said Okay here we are get out he said No I can win a war with you guys And that was a horrible miscalculation Not any more Right Right Yeah Right Saddam Hussein is not a religious person but he uses it When he sees it to his advantage uh and I think the people were smart enough to realize that and I think they're afraid of him Is what they are The population is afraid to speak out against him and I don't think he's going to be there too much longer Someone is going to assassinate him you know Yeah yeah Uh-huh That's right Yeah Right right I've heard reports that President Bush was staking his future on uh this war and that setting a precedent saying that this League of Nations will always combine against bullies and to stop this kind of stuff in the world Any would be bully would think twice if he knew that you know there's this United Nations or world government or whatever they keep talking about that the whole world will deal with you And you just can't do it and get away with it you know hoping that you know because it's a world thing and the nations will combine against you and you know you can't just do this Oh yeah had no teeth Right People I guess I feel sorry for just the average you know Iraqi who has had to go through all of this and the suffering I'm sure with no water No electricity no sanitation living conditions must be terrible and it's not getting any better the sanctions are still on You know except for a few medical supplies they are allowing through now and then powdered milk I guess for babies and things and until they I guess yesterday they came out with these rules I guess or whatever For a permanent cease-fire and the Kuwaitis said We don't want to have to repay Israel for all the bombing that we did that was in there you know But that's only fair Yeah Yeah It's going to be really tough for them to swallow but we don't want a Kuwait there you know just has no power at all and that you know because Iran still isn't too friendly with them And we don't want you know to be stabilized to the point where Iran will say Now is our chance you know to go in and wipe them out and Yeah yeah Yeah yeah since Khomeini died over there things have gotten a little more normalized Not quite as radical a stance more moderates are in power now Yeah Put in the middle And yet so many of the citizens are uh the Lebanese Who were hoping this would evolve into a war against Israel And uh trying to connect with Israel all that time and there really was no connection at all uh but boy those Lebanese in Jordan they were saying you know this whole war is Israel's fault because Israel told the United States to attack Iran it was like you know Israel controls our government Right but one thing I did learn was how deep the hatred runs toward Israel by a lot of countries They just hate I mean anyway you know they can see to connect into something and hate it more I mean they just I understand most of the land is now Israelis they bought and actually purchased it and then moved in and started a country Right Yeah right right and they both have holy sanctions
