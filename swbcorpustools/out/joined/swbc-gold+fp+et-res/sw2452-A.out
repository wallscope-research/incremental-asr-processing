Okay um The U S involvement in there then I guess even though Well it is over but I don't think we're out of there by any means and uh I wonder are we going to set up you know peace keeping type forces for long term You know is that something we should do or shouldn't do I don't know I think that's true because of all the support that came through The other thing that I think is good for like American businesses are to be involved is the reports that I hear back and of course on the news I try to listen and also read between the lines you know But they said that because the Americans you know took such a proactive stance involvement in the war that like so much of the business and the rebuilding in Kuwait and things like that will go to American businesses where as before they may be dealt with Japanese firms or other people They said even though the Japanese were involved monetarily uh they still like the first priority ought to go to American businesses you know which will be good for our economy But I you know Boy don't you know I mean we don't seem to slow down even when there is a crisis But I imagine Your oil companies they may see probably the first big rise in business they have seen in years Uh-huh I do too Yeah but look at their war that was his whole war is I'm not satisfied with what Iraq has I want what everybody has and you're right it's like you see two little pre-school kids fighting over a toy you know I am a little concerned about you know I know they are putting President Bush right now in an awkward position concerning The treaty over there right now You know what am I trying to say Well supporting the Kurds but uh you know the cease-fire I'm trying to say another yeah You know because he wants them to uphold their end of the deal as far as the cease-fire but at the same time he's not wanting to go in and say Okay I'm going to fight your war for you which I think is right should be 2 slash-units with final clause getting sv code You know if it's an internal thing I don't think we can walk in and say Gee I think you're right and you're wrong you know we're not the judge and jury Uh but I know that that's causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like Gee you told us to stand up against him but you're not helping So I think he's in a pretty awkward position now and I think we ought to help you know Yeah supply arms and support them if they need help but I don't think we ought to be over there fighting it for them and so I think he's done good on that stance Yeah Boy I would say That's right Yeah yeah I agree you know they'd advertised and said in the news and said he had the fifth largest army Well he may have but you Well not any more but you have to have loyalty you have to have people who believe in your cause You know I know they tried to turn it into a holy war because to them that is what's honorable You know if you die in a holy cause but I think they are smart enough to see there's nothing holy about it We just want to go in and took it You know Sure Sure Uh Well I hope that's true I would think so I would think that you know I guess in the back of my mind I think like maybe the Israeli Massad probably has ideas of going in and huh You know I thought they uh showed a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything but I don't believe for a minute that that means that they don't have ideas and plans of their own But I do agree with you I think President Bush handled it all politically very smart you know giving the support of the other Arabs and other nations in the world and I think that's how you have to go into something like that And don't you feel listen That's right And don't you think that long term that's been a big boost for the United Nations I mean the United Nations been there for years but all of a sudden Yeah there are some teeth behind it and the fact that when they have sanctions and we support things like this it means something And I think that's good for the strength of the United Nations Yeah And rebuild from nothing Yes Yeah That's true Right They supported it That is right Yeah they did ask that they build up Israel and Kuwait And I think they should have to They lost Well that's true Well I don't think Iran is under the same type of madman type leadership but there's always the possibility I guess I think so I think the person who really may be at this time has a hard road to tow is Jordan's King Hussein because he really tried to kind of straddle the fence You know he wasn't necessarily for Iraq but at the same time he didn't feel like everybody ought to be going against Iraq Yeah Right No I know isn't that amazing the way that they will find their cause no matter what situation they see they're going to find their cause whether it truly exists or not I know That's true But see you are also getting back to the ages old problem of Arab-Israeli conflict as far as personalties and who is the selected one of God and theirs tie so much to their religion So very different things than what we face
