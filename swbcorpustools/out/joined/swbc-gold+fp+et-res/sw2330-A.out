There we go I think that's true uh the Bermuda grass is greening up in March and sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of April So I think we're a little ahead of schedule on that That's true It's been a fun break but the break is over Yeah now the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny Well yeah but I'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend Yeah Yeah I haven't heard whether it's going to rain or not Well that's good Yeah that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year I think I haven't seen the weather on the news in the evening lately but I think the average high should be about seventy Yeah Yeah that's true Um one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high And what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable that it doesn't vary very much I mean any other time of year that's not the case because it could be very warm or very cold Uh-huh Right Right Yeah One of the weirdest things I saw I think it was around this time last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm you know I was going into the grocery store and a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead and it was twenty- six degrees out And I thought Well gee I've never known it to lightening at that temperature That's right uh it probably was a lot warmer up high Sometimes they get those inversions like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing The air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees The cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away Nope Yep I'm really enjoying this now Well this has been interesting Not too challenging to the brain Nope All right Ellen well you have a good day Bye
