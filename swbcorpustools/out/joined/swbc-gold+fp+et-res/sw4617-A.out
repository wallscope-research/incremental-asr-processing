Okay I see a good southern solution Uh-huh You'd have to say that Uh I don't know the things they asked to talk about were uh whether the judge should be the one that does the uh sentencing And seems to me that I think that's the way it's done now Uh at least my understanding of the law which isn't very good Uh it seems to me that the judge does it and I think that's probably all right in that they you know maybe know what the norm is for a particular thing Right Uh-huh That's right And I think that may be an exception as well Because I think that doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than the judge Yeah Yes In fact they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month And uh there's a big uproar going on right now Uh the uh Governor you know has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not You know it's someone who had uh killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact Yeah Uh-huh Something inexpensive Yeah I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and you'd hate to be one of those The other thing they asked about was whether uh uh the verdict should be required to be unanimous Which again I think is the way it is now That all verdicts well maybe not I don't know At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be unanimous Uh-huh Yeah The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial And that there's one juror that is uh different than the other eleven And uh they've only deliberated four hours or something and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked And the judge told them they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet Yeah Six months so far they said So Maybe they could go with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their uh vote Right Oh really That's interesting Well have you ever served on a jury Uh-huh I got called but I uh never uh got selected for a jury I <> sat for ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process and they had some guy that was uh defending himself
