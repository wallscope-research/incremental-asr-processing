Okay Yeah well we have quite a few but we don't really use them a lot well we like a lot of gasoline credit cards because we like to be able to stop you know when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a station but as far as like MasterCard and Visa we don't use those too often What about you Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah Oh really Huh Oh is it like an automatic debit or s- Oh huh Oh really Yeah We use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase but we always have the money set aside already and then we just pay it off the next month we don't like to pay interest on the credit cards at all Yeah Gosh Uh-huh Yeah Right Yeah Yeah that yeah we screwed up one time like that too We mailed it and they just never did get it and we had to finally mail them another check Huh Yeah I don't either No you figure you'll get your check back if you have to Yeah Really I like to use my card if I buy something through the mail which I don't do real often or something from out of state you know where if something is wrong you don't want to end up having to pay for it A couple times I've had to write big credit card companies and say you know I didn't really get this or I don't know what this is Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh Yes it's i- w- yeah if you filed that letter with them then they will kind of Yeah I'm like you too about the yearly fees uh I don't like to pay the yearly fee for a card Right now both the MasterCard and the Visa we don't have to pay a yearly fee on and since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the interest rate is too just as long as we don't have to pay that yearly fee Now we had American Express cards and my husband had always had that before we got married and those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars or something I think I can't remember but we decided let that one go and Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah But yeah like you said if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff it's more worth it Uh-huh Oh Yeah that wouldn't be too hard to do Yeah Have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to be stuck with that We've never had that problem either Uh-huh Yeah Right Yeah Yeah I guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something Lot of places have tho- I guess they're called those pointed sale terminals where it's like it goes in the minute you charge it Yeah Oh Oh gosh Yeah that's nice Right Yeah I like that feature and the insur- like if you break it yourself even you know if you buy something that's breakable Yeah Oh really Oh I didn't know that
