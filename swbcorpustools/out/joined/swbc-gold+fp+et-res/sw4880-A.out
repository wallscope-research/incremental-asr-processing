Well uh yeah I'm employed by a company that does do uh random drug testing and I've got some very definite uh opinions about it Uh you know which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from when they announced it But uh developed a little more I guess but haven't changed that much What about you Are you uh involved at all Yes Yeah Right Yeah Yeah Yeah that's mine it you know I go back to me no matter how much our company claims it's not a constitutional issue That because this is uh between a company and an employee it is not a government it's not the Constitution doesn't apply But it seems to me that it still should our company's doing it because they're a uh government contractor Uh and so it's required for certain + some form of drug program is required  to get the government contracts and I'd slash error Yes Okay and our company has taken that and gone all the way Say okay uh first off we don't have enough courage to uh pick out the people that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage uh because that would offend them uh if they weren't So we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even Uh and uh then uh and they so it's a complete random testing well it's random in the sense that you don't know when It is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested Uh and uh you know I sit at a terminal and write software all day it uh certainly has no life threatening uh capabilities uh you know in my job and uh yes I agree that there are uh jobs that are definitely life threatening and there needs to be a line drawn somewhere reasonable and proper I- you know Well Yeah that I will give credit to our company for in that I think there's a couple of levels of tests in terms uh of drugs And essentially the first thing is on the order of paper in the urine uh or some you know it's not quite that simple but it's fairly simple Coarse kind of test And then there's a much more uh uh refined test uh uh spectrography or whatever it's called The chemotography uh to determine exactly what the things are And uh No I've been with this company uh for sixteen years now And uh No and it has you know they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody And uh at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't know But on the other hand uh someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test
