How many you said yours are all I mean that sounds like an army Oh lord That is an army I came from a family of six and I have only got two and they are one Well I kind of decided that single children that that's not parenting that's a hobby But Well do not tell that to all my friends They are into quality time I am into getting through the day <> Well I can spot a kid you know whose parents spend every quality time with them you know outside of the work day And when I take care of some people's kids you know when they have teachers' holidays and that kind of stuff I will take my friends' kids that are usually in day care and you can spot them because they have no idea how to hang out and mess around Yeah Really It's not a problem for my two they are only eighteen months apart They can find things to do and mess around and plot and scheme and everything else did all five of yours complete college Well how did you go about selecting a college then Do you think that what they say that they are interested in is at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately graduating at Uh-huh Uh-huh How about the other three who went Uh-huh When they were like in junior high and high school I mean did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and Uh-huh Uh Uh-huh Yeah I was making three times what my father was making as an executive in the insurance industry when he retired Yeah I went uh four years to undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln because Lincoln is where my parents live And there really was not a choice I mean the finances uh dictated that you had to go there I kind of I am not going to say I resent it but I was well you know one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the Rhodes Scholars kids and the whole bit uh my parents did not even discuss with me going to college out of state or anyplace else and I just knew that the finances you know would not support it If I had known I am not going to say easy but how much less difficult than I thought it would be to get a uh scholarship to go anyplace else I think that I would definitely you know have gone Now when I finished there then I got a scholarship to go the Harvard University in Boston And uh I think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened I mean I was taken out of my element you know the homogeny midwest which is a lovely place to grow up and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently you know different life style And I think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me Now my kids I keep saying that uh you know I would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could And I do not know you know what the realities you know is going to look like you know we are putting money away already Uh but I really think it's important to put these children someplace where in addition to you know them getting an education they really need you know a socialization away from what they are raised in Especially if you lived a pretty insular community and An upper class suburb of Dallas let me tell you It's very different You should not Uh-huh Oh yeah Uh-huh
