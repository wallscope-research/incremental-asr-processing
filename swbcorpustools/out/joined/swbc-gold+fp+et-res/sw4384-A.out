The only experience I have I don't have any children but I've uh I was a baby-sitter in high school And then just recently after we were married I baby-sat for a dentist while she worked And I just uh Is it {Very faint} Oh yeah The expense Uh-huh Just sit around That that's true See the lady I did it for that's why she picked me is because I would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up So she could sleep in And uh then she could be at home and then I'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if I wanted too or whatever But uh she paid I think it was two or I think it was about two fifty three dollars a hour and by the time I paid taxes on it it I was getting like eighty cents and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything Yeah Right Oh wow  Wow Yeah I think people that treat their baby-sitters like that get a lot better baby-sitters And they stick around for longer Because I mean after I figured out I was getting eighty cents an hour I said bag it And I quit you know I was just like but I'm wasting my time I really liked the little girl and everything but I thought Yeah Yeah I Uh-huh Well and she was really spoiled They didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything So basically they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch And the mom was a dentist and I was just like we've got to quit this And she's like no I don't want her to starve But I don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat Like Eat this or So I can see the concerns on what different people want Because some I mean you know if I was setting up a daycare there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to Cause some parents won't put up anything Where others would Uh-huh No That's true I I'd love to do it But I just don't trust people now There's too many lawsuits I just I think it's a bigger risk than Yeah It would scare me With I don't know cause I'm sure some of them have good reason to sue but I think a lot of them are just you know they're negligent and they get happy about money and they just want to sue you Uh-huh Oh yeah That's impossible I have a girlfriend that works at a daycare and she takes her little girl with her and I mean she told me about half the people that they hire and half of them she'd like to turn them into the state And that's the people that are working there you know And then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in you know Like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before the same diaper You know just awful things And so I don't know I don't have kids but I always think man I just don't know if I could trust anybody I mean you just don't know Oh yeah That's true Yeah It would just rip me apart I think I don't know Just not knowing
