Well what kind of car did you just buy a car or are you in the market to buy a car or Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I seem to remember when I was young that was a problem No Seems that all of B17 is one utterance The "no's" are not negative answers but the start and restart of utt 3  no car was big enough for that Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah yeah Uh-huh Which is the one that has modular type seats You know which one I'm talking about They have the commercial on TV where you can pull some seats out and you can move around is that the Dodge Caravan that does that or Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Well the one that I can't remember it's the Toyota or one of the other ones I don't know if it's one of the Americans or the import ones where uh they actually have like uh some bucket seats in the back but you can actually pull them out I mean they're really easy to pull out Uh and you can uh move them around and stuff and it to me that would be real good for us Uh my husband and I uh like to go camping and stuff and right now we have a van which is it's an older van and we're thinking about buying another sedan uh probably next year Uh right now motorcycles takes precedence since that's what my husband really wants right now But uh next year we'll probably buy a new car and we're looking at uh possibly the Honda Accord Uh that's kind of uh as far as the interior it's got the luxury interior but it doesn't really have the luxury price tag that a lot of the other cars have which is one of the things that we were looking at You know finding something that's fairly affordable but yet has all the nice luxury items that we want Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Well I think it's going to be a lot easier now I just heard that they lowered the prime lending rate so I think it's going to be a lot easier to to be able to get a car now and finance it I think banks are going to be a little bit more lenient Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I can imagine You got to kind of work that into your budget Balance that and the house payment and of course uh if you buy a new car you're going to are any of your kids driving age yet are they twins Oh wow Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well the Honda's have been very safe in accidents uh more so that a lot of the American cars Matter of fact I just heard something today on the news about those uh automatic seat belts that are attached to the door uh they're questioning the safety of those now saying that and they showed uh a simulation where there they had a dummy in the car and the door opened and the dummy actually fell out of the car and the car rolled out on top of him So they're saying they're not as safe as they give the appearance of being safe but they're really not as safe as they uh appear to be So uh I'm kind of concerned about that as far as you know the seat belts Uh I don't know if Maryland has uh a seat belt law/ but they do have one in Texas And you're required to wear them Exactly But uh probably about well I don't know about ninety but probably fifty percent of the people that have those probably don't wear the lap portion of it I know my brother doesn't and he has one in his car So I mean it kind of gives you a false sense of security You think oh I've got one portion of my seat belt on uh but if your door comes open you know it's not going to do you any good So that's a concern of mine as far as uh what I'll be looking at with buying a new car Uh I'm not really sure if I would want the seat belts attached to the door I think I would feel better with them attached to the actual car The inside where they're normally attached to like behind the door Uh-huh Um Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah the Le Mans is like that too Uh we used to have a Le Mans when I was in high school uh and it was a big car I mean it was like uh the Grand Prix and in I think around nineteen eighty uh they changed the model and it like went to half the size Literally I mean it got chopped in half and it wasn't even the same car anymore Didn't even remotely resemble the old car Yeah Well everybody that I've talked to who's ever had a Honda loves them And my husband had a Honda uh and it was a lease car and he had to turn back in uh a year and a half ago Uh and he had it for four years and never had a single problem with it And it was great Uh and the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because we didn't feel at the time the residual was like sixty-five hundred dollars and it was a four year old car with seventy thousand miles on it and we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for uh a four year old car So so we ended up just went ahead and just turned the keys back in and got out of the lease Uh <> one thing that I am curious about is uh reading information on air bags some of the vans I think I don't know about the Dodge Caravan but some of the vans now have driver side air bags Which I think is a good idea
