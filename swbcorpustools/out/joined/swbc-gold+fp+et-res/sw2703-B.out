Okay Uh-huh uh-huh I'm a big baseball fan too E- well I like I teach school and so during the school year I just don't have time to read And you know I would love to be able to read more because I enjoy it so much But with correcting papers and two kids of my own I just don't have time But in the summer I try to read a lot and of course being a woman I like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot I just I really enjoy that because it's kind of a getaway type thing So I read a lot of that But I also love sports And uh uh I don't have time to read in but I do read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED during the year because my son gets that And uh but uh I don't read a lot of nonfiction and I really should because there's so many self-improvement books out right now that would benefit me greatly but I just don't Yeah yeah Oh do you Uh-huh Oh my word Yeah It's i- some of those books are real tough to get into but after you get into them they're really good But it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so Yeah It's right that's right I find though that when I find an author uh and you don't read a lot of fiction you said But when I find Do you When I find an author I really like I try to read everything they write Because you get used to their style and you really enjoy it Uh-huh I've heard of him Is that right Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books about science fiction I think that's unbelievable Oh does he really Oh <> Is that right Is that right Uh-huh Well I've never read anything of his but I've heard about him But wouldn't you think he would does he get some royalties from that hopefully Well I would think he would Oh I'm sure he is I'm sure he is But sometimes the more you get the more you want too so Yeah Oh yeah Oh right right right in fact I'm a sports fan period We I mean that's why I like to read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED so much because there's everything in it Oh So you're probably uh a Baltimore fan right an Oriole fan Is that right Boston Oh well that's good too I'm sure you do Well I'm a Ranger fan simply because I live here But I was uh I'm not from here I'm originally from Ohio so I've always followed the Tigers Because you know I was born and raised in Toledo Yeah Oh I love the Mud Hens They're great I love the name and there was a really big article on the Mud Hens in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED last year Did you Yeah I li- I really enjoy that team we used to go there all the time I used to live in Iowa too and they have the Iowa Oaks And we used to go to their games all the time And I know they don't Oh they must have changed then Because it used well I haven't lived there for l- I've been here for like twelve years now And I haven't been back to Des Moines in a long time But we used to always go to their games and it was kind of fun It's almost uh more fun than going to a major league game I don't know I just really enjoy the farm teams Yes it is It's not quite so serious you know That's for sure that's for sure Is that right Is that right Well like how much is an Oriole game Oh gosh See it's higher than the Rangers Oh yeah A- the food here is outrageous But uh you can get a good seat for uh well it used to be three dollars But I think it's gone up to four dollars this year But you know it's in the bleachers way out you know in center field but it's still nice You still can see well And uh we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets you know box seats or something then we usually sit out there Box seats run from oh like eight dollars to twelve dollars Oh so it'll go up Uh-huh Oh oh Uh yeah that's a bummer Well see baseball here though is the cheapest game in town Because the Cowboys it's outrageous to go to the Cowboy game And the Mavericks are t- it's high too So baseball's cheap compared to other games Well that didn't go over now you know George Bush who's the main owner of the Rangers decided that uh they'd stay in Arlington So Arlington's going to build a stadium a bigger one So they're going to stay there Which is fine because Arlington's got a lot of things to offer and that was their main money making you know deal for the city And it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away Because everything there's Six Flags right by the stadium there's a Wet 'n Wild and it you know that's all the tourists come there and they it would have been devastated they would have collapsed So I'm kind of glad they're staying there Because it's right in the middle of Fort Worth-Dallas and you know Yeah I like it there And I think Dallas has enough to offer that they don't have to hog everything So I'm glad that they're staying in Arlington And it's takes us maybe uh well thirty-five to forty minutes to get there from Plano which is not too bad at all Yeah So Is that right Uh-huh Oh gosh Yeah Yeah Yeah Well not really Now my son does I have a son that just turned sixteen and he reads everything he get his hands on He's reading a Dick Vitelle book right now because he's a real big Dick Vitelle fan He's a basketball fan because he plays for the high school he goes to and uh just loves Dick Vitelle which not many people do but he's reading it and he's r- and he says He's so interesting Mom You just can't believe all the things he's done And he's really enjoying that And I and he said Mom you need to read it after I get finished So maybe I will I never heard that one Uh-huh Huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I'll have to tell my son about that I'm sure he'd like it Oh that would be good
