Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh Yeah I have not even heard believe it or not of that person I'm not kidding when you said it it was kind of like a surprise Yeah I think mainly because I haven't been watching what's politically going on Uh you know in that aspect I as far as like now the new house bill that went to Minnesota uh being that it is their neighboring state and that I lived in Minnesota I'm more familiar with the politics that involved with that and that being passed But uh as far as politics in the grander uh part of it as if you want to look at uh election type things I'm not quite sure even if I'm going to vote Uh it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that to make the decision on who would be the best to run Uh Uh-huh Sure Exactly Uh-huh Sure Uh-huh Sure He might be one of those sure Uh it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer uh when you think of some of the best presidents we've had in the past have been people that have struggled to get to the top I mean they were not rich in in any means and it has been kind of in the past uh I don't know maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved with politics they've had to have money And you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way Uh so it makes the common person uh not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a fabulous job because he's got people that are quite intelligent and I don't know if we'll ever see that you know Where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and uh has uh you know you think of Abraham Lincoln and you know just the background of Abraham Lincoln You know teaching himself to read He didn't go to college He didn't you know do all the other things that uh you know you would think that was real popular to do and to get politically involved in and have money He didn't come from money Uh and now it's Uh-huh sure Uh-huh Yeah So you really know a lot of his background It was the big one It's the one that everybody wants Yeah Whether or not I you know you look at all these candidates that want to become president I really have to ask them why you know Uh it's the toughest job in the world to do And not only that you don't have that much freedom to make choices I mean you have to go through so many different you have to go the House the Congress and all of the other things to get a bill passed And sure you can <> veto it at the last minute but then it's not like you have all that power and I think long time ago presidents did have a lot of power
