Uh-huh Okay Yeah Uh-huh I see Yeah Yeah yeah that's for sure Well we uh I just got married about six months ago and we bought a house at the same time So we're I'm sitting here in my forty year old house and we're about halfway through the painting process So uh the only uh I guess the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color We ended up with our living and dining room are now uh kind of a light peach color with uh and it's got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff so we've got the trim in uh kind of an off-white And this is really the first uh interior painting project that I've attacked And uh it's been something else to say the least we had the same type of situation Uh the walls were uh uh well they weren't the color difference wasn't so bad but uh there was semigloss underneath and we put a flat over the top and everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see It seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint Every time the sun would come up in the morning I'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can But uh we've learned we've worked our way back into the hallway and we're in the middle of the bathroom now But uh it's been quite an adventure <> the other thing that makes it uh a little more difficult we've got all hardwood floors and uh we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the first time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a toothbrush and what not cleaning up Well it's not too bad It it uh the floors are finished with a polyurethane and it's really not to bad to get off typo to> too it it we're just using latex and it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even it uh comes off with like a mild abrasive pad like a scotch-brite pad or something like that and soap and water So we got pretty lucky on that No not really But Okay yeah Yeah Oh gosh Yeah yeah probably so Okay Yeah Yeah Yeah I uh Yeah uh our house was painted as part of the purchase contract so we didn't have to mess with that this time But I grew up on a farm so I've messed with outdoor painting a little bit uh but most of that it was done with a sprayer and uh up in the bucket of a loader tractor or something like that so it took a lot of the hassle out And then they're you know you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a grainery or something like that as you would be with your own house Uh a little bit yeah yeah Yeah Yeah Oh gosh yeah just the opposite of what everybody's uh working towards now Yeah yeah absolutely Yeah uh we stocked up the first time around But we've definitely got all the formulas on file and uh they'll be there for a while we're pretty comfortable with that But yeah it it I'm real nervous every time I open a new can I'm wondering if I shouldn't buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a washtub or something somewhere because I'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match But uh It's gone pretty well It just it takes some time My problem is while I I'm not overly proud of it but I'm a self-proclaimed perfectionist and it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that And I'll find something as I'm going along something not related like uh I've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they really didn't match They were a few of them were broken and things like that So I always pick up these little extra tasks as I'm doing this and the painting actually takes probably uh a fourth of the time and I'm always doing all this other stuff and my wife's hollering at me and wondering what else I've come home with from work this time to put in a ceiling fan or something strange like that So uh it always it gets you to look at everything real hard when you start putting a coat of paint on everything you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere Yeah Yeah it sure makes a difference Yeah Yeah it's been uh we bought this house with the idea that we were going to you know spend a lot of time working on it and uh it was part you know part of the excitement was getting a good deal on an older house that just really hadn't been taken care of very well it was actually it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that So uh we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it But uh there just isn't enough time I find myself going to work knowing that there's a job about half done at home and I really if I'd just stay home and finish it I'd feel a lot better but uh I'm starting to learn that there's always something else Once you get done you can always start over and you make up all kinds of excuses So uh  slash error  Uh not a whole lot slash error It they're in pretty good condition um as far as uh major repairs You know a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that but uh the only the most major things have been uh oh I guess I moved a couple of outlets and er uh switches I should say For some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway and uh yeah and I didn't like that very well so I moved that but uh most of it's in pretty good shape/ Uh live in Dallas Okay okay Uh No no I haven't uh I hadn't tried In fact we were planting flowers this weekend So uh I was pretty tied up but Uh-huh Yeah that uh Yeah you know it I get a sore neck from looking up all the time yeah things like that but uh no that pretty much covers my experiences Oh yeah most definitely it just it makes such a difference I like I say the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much Uh I don't want to put a price on it but I just feel like every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house You know every time I do something aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home an you know the walls are clean and they match and all those kinds of things Yeah yeah we do uh it sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't It's a uh when I start doing trim I've gotten to where I tend to freehand it because there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that uh it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore and uh Yeah yeah they y- No there's no carpet in the house right now Umkay Well you know um Yeah I've seen uh they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths And uh you can tape them together and put
