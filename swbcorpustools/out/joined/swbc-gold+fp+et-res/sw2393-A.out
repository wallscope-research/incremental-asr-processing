All right Uh-huh How fine Um Oh boy Uh-huh Oh really Wow Um Well we just moved to our first home and we had lived in a condominium before So we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties So we're just learning the ropes here and But when we moved in um our backyard has so many tall trees in it that there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard So we're you know talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things and learning about different kinds of grass We trying to go grow grass and it just seems so funny to me that when I grew up in Missouri and you didn't have to worry about growing grass there It just happened automatically Yes We are we planted some fescue last um fall and it's really really pretty and um green I think this should be part of the previous slash unit--what follows the conjunction is NOT a clause it stayed pretty green throughout the winter and it's pretty goo- it's not as thick and as nice it doesn't look like it can withstand too much you know It's supposed to die off like in August and then you replant it in September and So but we don't the Saint Augustine and all that supposedly was back there just wasn't like I say there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the backyard And um so mostly you know we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers and flower beds or even gardens that we're just saying let's get some grass Let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much You know Uh-huh Oh yeah Oh no On its own Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes It's pretty remarkable because growing up we've always had a beautiful lush green lawn and we never there was no such thing as watering your lawns in Missouri It just happened And um so it's been real fun here to see there's a big market for the nurseries and for the landscaping companies and a lot of people um we live in north of Dallas And um Plano Uh-huh up north And so there's a lot of market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the Dallas area and big market for yard work Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes they do I noticed that they're really putting in small back yards because most of the houses have the alleys that run behind and so that really cuts into your backyard space and But we don't do our work here out of enjoyment so much as <> right now we just moved in in September so we're just still at the point where we're talking about the necessity Uh-huh Yeah Um Hm We Uh-huh Grass Um Or what it was Well we're going to have to do that because have the shade the trees this is an established and older home that we moved into and um the trees are just so tall and there must be ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that like even if its raining you can go out in our back yard and not get wet Well that's what we're looking forward to and that's what they say the payoff is but Well we ha- Too hot yes Well there are all different kinds There are some oaks magnolias and like plum trees peach trees there are some big tall oak trees
