There you go First question do you own your house Our name is on the till so that implies ownership That's right I would not object if anybody did Yeah Well we have had this one for five years now Before that we lived in Garland uh probably about you know four blocks away Liked the area chose to stay inside of Spring Park It's a uh I don't know if you have been up here but it is a residential homeowners association So there's a lot of you know activities a lot of pluses and common land But uh we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market you know it could not possibly have gone any lower and so we were wrong Yeah I think what it bottom out about a year later Oddly enough two years you know uh I think that not in uh this area Cause this is about like the Yeah No it's Richardson It's Richardson and hold on a second <> Paul I can hear you perfectly perfectly well I don't want to hear you You are being rude Whatever you ask or scream when I'm on the phone the answer is no Do you understand <> How does that sound Yeah there I go Yeah well I hate to say how long that will last too No this area up here is uh all custom homes and it's I don't think that many by the builder that built this house And we were not the first owners I think we are the third owners It was built by the architect for himself who never moved into it Who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep Oh yeah caulking windows was a great mystery to them So they just watched the water pour in on the carpet But it's a Sharif Myneer Homes if that means anything it did not really mean anything to me except I liked it He builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now I think he got out of the lower end market And decided but the houses here in this class of housing never dropped below two hundred Yeah well but still I know that this one was built for two ninety nine which is nowhere near what we paid for it And I think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot heavily wooded off the golf course Yeah and the guy around the corner is being transferred so he said uh well he did comparables that it's about eighty dollars let's see what I don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot off the creek and eighty on the creek or if it was eighty and a hundred I think it was sixty eighty I think Well try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot No it could not be because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars Just never Now maybe you know that's pretty close to what it would have sold for uh brand new or that's pretty much what it was built for It's got an awful lot of nice things in it but you know I think it's going to be a long time if ever when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really uh desirable It's seems like people go for square footage only now and uh cause Have you been back to the Perry Homes back here The one that looks like Monopoly apartments They are huge when you are inside them They are very spacious They are you know I was in one today It was forty two hundred square feet Yeah Uh-huh See when you have kids you like to be able to send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them But I have been watching these houses go up and I don't well somebody was telling me I know somebody who lives back there I have always questioned the quality of construction and I don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house When you watch them go up you are just amazed that they do not fall over And it takes them something like thirty days to complete a house Uh-huh We have got three different levels of decking because this lot slopes way back down and uh the house is built around the trees And with these decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up so it's real real shady But that's one of the few things that really uh immediately pays back on return But what I was going to tell you these Perry Homes back there when the people from M C I come down and you know they are used to the Virginia area metropolitan D C My God they come down here and those houses that look the colonial look what the Right And uh the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars which is probably about what their equity is that they got out of selling their house Because those things are selling like hot cakes But one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill per month last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month And I thought and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here And I was thinking well you know I know why your God damn bill is so high it's because there's no insulation in those things Yeah Any yet you know they show very well unless you have you know lived in a lot of houses around the area or looked at a lot of houses around here And I think that makes a big difference But I like this area and everything that I have been saying says that it's I think if we had to sell now we could come close to breaking even you're in the
