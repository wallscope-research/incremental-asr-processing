Yes I do Well I think that's a big part of it and I think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home and I almost think with our society and inflation and the cost of things anymore couples have to work outside the home but yeah I think that's a big change I'd like to not work What about you Yeah Uh-huh Yes I have two and that's been a big deciding factor because I mean I never wanted to be a career woman but as long as I you know was going to work I was going to do as much as I could as well as I could et cetera And I wanted to stay home when I had kids Well I have two I have a four year old and a three year old And we would like two more but I it's like we talked Uh I don't want two more unless I can quit and stay home and take care of them which is something right now financially it takes both people to work Yeah It's full time work Uh-huh Yeah You do there's sa- of course you know everything you give up something but I just I the kids are so wonderful But I do think that's one of the major changes {D You know } my mama I remember her being home uh you know she made breakfast in the morning for us And if she worked it was part time and it was work that was done while we were maybe at school and she was there when we got home You know and Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Oh Oh Yeah See and I think Oh Oh But see it's such an important time to be home You know And that was important to me enough you know my husband was raised uh his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked and he's like well you know what's the big deal about being home for your kids Well as our kids are getting older you know he sees it more I said Russ you don't understand what it was like to have her home or if you needed Mom at school you know she was there to help or she was there to take you and I want to be able to do those things so Yeah I think that's wonderful So where do you see us changing in the future Well see that was one of the things  the question I think is you know what changes do we see and I'm not sure I see it go anywhere I think they are still going to have to work Right Uh-huh Uh-huh The day care eats me alive You know I pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty a month for two kids They would eat you alive I know No I'm not and I would love you talked about having the summers off and I thought oh that would be so wonderful And I love the little preschool they are in It's wonderful You know so I feel good about them being there but it's still not the same It's just not Uh-huh Uh-huh Please come back to work Sure That's wonderful That's wonderful I like that Well we're working on it I'm hoping in about three to five years I'll be able to stay home and my kids of course will be in school then but I'll be there mornings I'll be there noons I'll be there afternoons and all I feel like that's good and I can work part days in my husband's business you know so that he can afford for us to do that you know
