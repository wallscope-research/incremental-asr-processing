Okay Miss Nancy we should be in business now Did you hear the questions that the lady uh brought up Such as how much time well I'll ask how much time do you spend with your children and how many do you have Uh-huh Well you're very fortunate Uh my uh I have two girls and a son And my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam Holland Her husband builds pianos so it's kind of hard for us to visit with them as much as I'd like to Because one thing we do have together is we're both musicians I play in several symphony orchestras and she is a concert uh harpsichordist And travels around a good bit in Europe And uh her husband builds forte pianos which are harpsichord size pianos And uh that's why they're over there And then I have a son who lives in uh Warrington Pennsylvania And I get to see him maybe once every three months So we've lost you know I'd like to have an everyday contact with children uh as well as you do for that matter and young my youngest daughter lives in New Jersey and so I don't hardly get to see any of them She works in these um Trump type casinos she and her husband both do uh they're really both um people who play on stage and uh they're running lights right now and audio and that thing for plays and things that go on But anyhow uh what activities do you do with your children when you are together Oh The Soviet space exhibit My goodness I am surprised they would bring anything over here Uh-huh I'll bet Uh-huh Well that sounds like you have really wonderful activities that keep you together Yeah Well that's wonderful slash error: should be ba Uh-huh slash error should be 'b' Uh-huh The only problem is it keeps you pretty busy keeping everything going doesn't it Uh-huh Beautiful Uh-huh Uh-huh That's great There's a the question now to ask is it difficult to find time and you seem to be making out all right Well tell me what do you think uh of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth Uh-huh Yes Uh-huh Well that's no that's exactly what I was going to say of course I find now that I spend more time with my grandchildren in detail I know more about them and watch their growth and how they improve and learn much more so than my own kids when your own children are growing up you just take them for granted and you go ahead and do your thing and
