Okay Well I can see it in certain cases where uh somebody's in a position that uh perhaps a lot of lives are involved like maybe uh pilots that uh you know fly jets and uh maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people I could certainly see it being done but in general uh you know whether companies want to do this and I know that companies do Like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested I know a couple of corporations that are doing that Uh so you know they kind of have gotten into the idea that let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab But there's got to be like a limitation Do we drug test everybody that comes in or do we kind of say well you can be drug tested and you look okay because you look this way you're very conservative and there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs but the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of uh the conservative or whatever could be drug tested And uh you know whether legal rights of that person I don't know There's certainly a lot of things to really consider uh when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless of course like I said they have a large responsibility over a mass of people uh that's about it Uh-huh uh-huh Sure sure And I think that's what companies are doing uh more and more because there are products that are out there Uh-huh Exactly Sure sure Sure Exactly The only thing is Exactly Exactly The only thing is uh the one issue that I would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive If they have had like uh medications in the past let's say once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an Advil and the Advil will apparently come out positive as if they smoked marijuana Uh and there's poppy seed type things I think that everybody is aware of that but uh where's the line where you say to somebody I'm going to drug test you tomorrow so please do not take these medications or where's you know how you can do it Exactly Uh-huh Sure Sure Exactly An- and the only thing that I would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on Let's say uh you've taken medication of some sort even though they usually have you at the time list what medications you've taken Uh let's say you do come out positive and you've taken Advil or any of the Ibuprofen products out there Or you've had a cold and you've been on medication or whatever you come out positive Is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well you know this is kind of iffy you know are they really on drugs or they on drugs you know what I'm saying Where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person uh is on drugs or they may make up their mind that let's get rid of this employee you know what I'm saying Uh-huh Exactly And it's a they can that the if it does come out positive the first time they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take you know what I mean it's kind of like uh I think most people are aware at least now common knowledge is that
