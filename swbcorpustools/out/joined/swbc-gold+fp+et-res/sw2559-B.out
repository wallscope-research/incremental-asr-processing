Well I don't really like that very much What was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff Oh Oh yeah Uh-huh Um Well that's not really good I don't know I guess that's an invasion of privacy I'm not sure that that's an everyday thing though at least not for you know an individual Something that I feel is pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that's really so common that it's accepted as the norm now is the open office concept Uh-huh where they have you know the little partition dividers throughout a large room and people have little cubicles Well that's all fine and good but you don't really have any privacy at all Right Yeah and it's not just that it's uh the whole thing about you know if you're trying to concentrate well it's rather hard sometimes it's almost impossible to do because um you know you're space is not your own space And I work in a situation like that and I really kind of have a problem with that Oh yeah Is there anybody who doesn't Um Yeah Um Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah I don't think that's quite right either Yeah Hum what do you think could be done about it Uh-huh Yeah It really is It's something that I've just had a dealing with is like a credit bureau Well they take my name which is a very common name and my last name is even more common and <> they check that name against uh their list and they find several And without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all they just report everything under that name they don't even check my Social Security number And companies are paying them good money to report accurately and they're not they're so lazy They're just not doing it I mean they just find your name and they match it up You know and that just drives me crazy because they're and then they want then you know to get it removed they say well you know you have to write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them you know and then it takes three weeks and all And I'm like baloney You messed it up you fix it No what I've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report like uh uh recently I was reported as having J C Penney accounts and I don't So I called J C Penney and I said uh I just wanted to let you know that the credit agency you're using is incorrectly reporting the information that you're providing to them And they say uh-huh because they really don't want to pay for a service that's not being done properly either So then they can call the credit bureau and say hey you know we're paying you good money to report this properly and you're not doing your job So that's what I've taken to doing lately and it seems to work pretty well so far Not that I can think of Yeah Oh yeah I probably better let you get back to work Okay All rightie Bye-bye
