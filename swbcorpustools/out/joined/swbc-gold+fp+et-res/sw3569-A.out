Well uh until recently I was taking the WALL STREET JOURNAL and I thought that was a good way but I have about five different magazines that I get that keeps me up on things You know it's a week or two late but uh that's how I'm staying up Uh do you like how it's presented on the news So it makes you feel like they're uh wanting you to take their opinion Yeah I've noticed that too and it's kind of distressing isn't it And I've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words uh usually uh just that sway the whole uh report you know by just a couple of words So communications huh Were you looking into becoming a reporter or Uh-huh I bet that's a interesting job Yeah there's one that I'm reading right now It's INFORMATION WEEK It says A T and T to account for the benefits that the A I C P A now says you have to show as a liability It's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety-three to account for that And it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more Yeah it is And yeah you have to stay up on stuff and I bet in your job that you have to do you read the WALL STREET JOURNAL Can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective I guess they do that so they don't get scooped you know so they have the big story
