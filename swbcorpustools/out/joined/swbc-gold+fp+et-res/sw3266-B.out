Do you have any children Oh I work in a day-care center and Yes I enjoy it a lot Oh Do they go to a day-care center or do they stay at Oh that's nice Oh that's nice I think so I think it's hard to find a good day care I have worked at some other ones that were not very good in my opinion But this one that I'm in now is very good And one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children And like in Pennsylvania for babies that's what I work with there has to be a one to four ratio at the most No more than four babies per care giver But we keep it down to like two to one Yeah that makes it a little easier to deal with Oh I know We What we do is we have these cribs in the back room where they sleep that are um low to the ground and they're reenforced real strong and they'll sit four babies We would just lie them in there and they roll real well and maneuver That will get them out No Right Right Yeah that's certainly something we hope never happens Most really care in this center really care Uh most everyone has a college degree in like early childhood education And really there's only like eight children per room and then there's like two or mostly three care givers in each room And that enables them to spend more time with the children Sometimes I feel like all I'm doing is changing diapers giving bottles and putting babies down for a nap So it's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them It's easy to get attached to them too Um in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months And throughout the center it goes up to like age twelve So I have the real young ones in my room Uh-huh you know they're wonderful They don't complain too much Yes They are a lot of fun Not quite It's a when they start to crawl they try to climb up on things and you have to be real careful everything is baby proof You know all the doors have latches and stuff so they can't get into anything but they try But yeah In my area because I live in a college town in Penn State University so I there is a lot of college educated people and stuff that are in the centers that really seem to have an idea of what's going on And uh in general though I've been really disappointed with a lot of other centers I've worked at and all it's not my choice for when I have children but some people don't have a choice Yes Uh-huh That is sad What Oh my God Oh Oh my God Oh that poor child That's awful <> Well I
