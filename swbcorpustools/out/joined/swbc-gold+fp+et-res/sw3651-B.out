What kind of woodworking do you do Uh-huh Uh well I like to think of it as a hobby but I guess also partly out of necessity Just repairing things around the house Uh a few years ago uh uh they needed some book shelves and I kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves and uh it actually worked pretty well and over the years I've refined those plans I got myself a router and I'm very good at making book shelves it's also a way of relieving stress My wife kind of laughs at me that anytime I get stressed out I just go out in the garage and we've got more book shelves Uh well yeah I mean little by little I started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things Uh gotten a good belt sander and the router uh helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router The latest project that I've been working on {A and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months } is a cabinet to put a T V in Right And it works well because you can design it to suit whatever equipment you have so I designed a space just the right size for the T V and then the V C R and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment And uh that's worked pretty well Uh uh with the router you can make nice uh I guess dado joints is what it's called Uh And it's uh That's right That's right So But what I need next is a good table saw And I debate whether it's better to get uh just a straight table saw or to get one of these uh rotary arm saws Radial arm saw is I guess what they're called Uh it seems to me the radial arm saw is better well it takes up less room I mean you set the wood down and you move the saw Whereas if you're ripping wood you're probably better off with a table saw Yeah Uh that's partly my problem now I don't have room for this uh I uh where we lived before up north uh basements were common and I used to put all the stuff in my basement but not so here in Texas Yeah Uh-huh Have you ever used a lathe
