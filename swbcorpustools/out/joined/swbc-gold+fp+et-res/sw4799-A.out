Okay Uh I haven't been in this situation yet You know my parents are not quite at that age yet so I haven't No So I haven't uh really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother uh but that's really about it How about you Have you been in that situation yet <> Uh-huh Did it really Yeah Oh no That's sad Yeah Oh okay I'm sure they were Yeah Uh-huh Ah Yeah Oh Um Yeah Uh-huh Yeah And I'm sure it's expensive/ Yeah Yeah Yeah my grandmother is not in a nursing home but she's in a oh uh they're apartments for senior citizens and she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long and then they have uh where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go and she really does love that but she's just concerned about in the future you know That she knows it's not going to be like that all the time And she's just wondering well what's going to happen to me and I {D you know I guess it's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that but you know she's kind of asking questions about well what's going to happen this can't last forever and so Yeah Yeah she can but I think it is also cafeteria style Because I doubt if she rarely cooks for herself So uh because I remember in her letters telling me she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat so I'm assuming it's something like that too So Uh-huh Yeah yeah Uh-huh And she lives by herself too She seems to like it And uh my husband's grandmother is well she lives in a house on her own and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that but she has her own home and she's doing really well I'm really proud of her She's doing really well so we haven't had to do anything but then again she has a lot of support so I mean she's got her mother in town too and things like that so Hopefully we won't need to go that route Yeah
