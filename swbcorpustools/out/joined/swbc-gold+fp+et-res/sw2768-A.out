Okay Um I don't have any I guess definite views about elderly care Um the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see where elderly people are abused and things like that I think that's one thing that I would look at if I was putting my grandmother or my mother uh in some sort of home The first thing that I would look at would be their history As far as any court cases that came out of there um the history of you know their doctors um their nurses and things like that Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Just out of curiosity what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh my goodness Uh-huh In pain or something Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh That's great Yeah I would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or anyone is in a home like that And my biggest fear is that they would be lonely And I would like to know that there are you know just a lot of activities like you said you know just putting a plant in a room You know just brightens and  just makes them just a little more active Television They can go outside and just to know that they're not you know laying in a room looking at gray walls You know that's what would just really kill me I'd like to know that you know they have friends there and they have little conversations and things I'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and maybe some kind of activity little field trips or something I don't know how they would do that But Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that That's really neat Right Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh That's great That will be something you know they would look forward to if they knew you know that the puppy is coming on Wednesday You know that would be something to look for That's really neat That really is Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah Putting any of my family in an elderly home to me would be the very last resort You know it um and I know it's hard for a lot of families if you're trying to work or trying to take care of your own family it's kind of hard to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent you know on you And I know that's hard sometimes but it would really have to be a last resort because that would just I would feel so guilty I don't know Unless I knew that they were somewhere I mean just really great You know that they were really enjoying I don't know anyone personally that's in an elderly home Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Nod your head and smile at them Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Oh Oh That's something that if I had to work in an elderly home I don't think I could do it Like I would really like to be a teacher But I don't think I could do it Because I'm very very emotional And I mean the minute something happens I cry on I mean Hallmark commercials That's just the end of me And so I mean something real life I just I interview a lot of children I'm an education reporter and I always go and do an education things I meet these kids who are you know dropping out of school left and right And all the sudden they're in this program They're making straight A's they're going to graduate early and I just want to hug them and go you are just fantastic And you know I could just imagine you know working in a home like that And those people they're so sweet and so genuine You know and all they want is just for everything to be happy you know And so that would probably just tear me apart I mean in a good way but You know Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I'm sure Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right Yeah And children I mean usually a of elderly people they like to uh share their experiences with the younger children They'll be telling them all kinds of stories that they don't even know what they mean You know they feel like they've lived life so they need to share it And I'm sure I'll be like that too Yeah But that's great I didn't know there were such groups Uh-huh Yeah Yeah And I would hate it if anyone put me in one Yeah Somebody take care of me Okay Okay well nice to talk to you Uh-huh Bye-bye
