Okay you say you're going to buy a new car Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Right Right Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I understand that We uh just paid off one my wife's car uh I guess early last year and so we're you know enjoying not having that payment every month and but it's getting up in age uh we're trying to hold out a little while longer uh we've got a daughter who's almost two now so we're getting to the point where we really kind of need something a little bigger than what we've got but uh so I guess when we do buy another car it'll be something that we can uh kind of grow into a little bit it's tough on trips because uh anytime we're getting ready to go anywhere uh you know it's uh like trying to put a puzzle together to make sure you get everything in the car you know cause it's Uh-huh Right that's what I would like that in fact uh you know I've thought of that possibly uh getti- I don't know that my wife would go for it but You know I'd like to do that I have a truck myself and I'll take you know a truck's a thing that you need when you need it but you know the rest of the time you wonder you know could I use something else So I've still got a couple years payments on it I may uh if we can hold out til then you know I may get to where I need a something else maybe buy a van because they are really really nice for long trips especially Uh-huh Right Right Right Um Right I don't either Well my wife's car is probably around five years old now and it's got oh uh I guess it must have seventy or eighty thousand miles on it you know and so it's getting it's not in bad shape you know she's kept it up real well but uh you know it's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it you know if we're going to get anything out of selling it So I'm hoping we that we can work something out here We've got other bills that kind of precede or preclude us buying something else It really is you know and uh you can't afford you know a car payment now It just will wipe you out every month it's almost getting to be like the house payment you know Right Right Uh-huh Oh I didn't know that Uh-huh Oh man yeah Right Right Uh-huh Right Right n- uh that's our daughter's problem you know 'cause when you get out on the road like that it's just long stretches you know where they just have to sit you know In town she does okay you know and even on the road she does all right for a little while because she'll sleep some but you know i- she wakes up she wants to get up I know uh uh right before Christmas we had driven over to Shreveport and we were driving back and it was when all that bad weather was hitting and the roads were all closed and uh we were trying to get back and it took us a lot longer and you know she was pretty good most of the way but then get to a point where she just had to get out of her seat and we had to stop and we got out and played in the snow and put here back in typo> her and she was fine but you know if there was something to where she could kind of get up and move around like you say on the highway or where where it wasn't as bad you know just for a little brief period of time it would be okay so I'm thinking maybe we <> can do something like that later on Ye- we'll see what we can do Yeah Well I gue- Y- you too I hope everything works out Right
