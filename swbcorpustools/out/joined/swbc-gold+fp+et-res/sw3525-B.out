I think golf isn't it Are you a hacker Oh I know I did I know I did Course I know I watch my thirteen year old play now you know and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body Uh-huh Sure Yeah That's what it takes you need to play that often to get a really good handicap Well I went to I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more and I went after it and and I really didn't find much improvement Fact ever time I'd start trying to correct something it seemed like the score would listen go back up yeah I think I need to uh I probably need to take some more lessons uh more current uh and practice more often Spend more time on the Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah Oh yeah I'm familiar with it Oh yeah if you play regular I think it makes a big difference Yeah yeah well I've also found too I try to work out regularly and when I am doing that uh and feeling loose that I swing better I get through the ball better Uh and I also if I I found as I've gotten a little older here I worry less about my distance And I my control is a little bit better there Uh so Uh-huh Uh-huh have you ever tried a one iron Uh-huh Well you know I put mine back in my bag this year too and I used a three wood rather than a driver Uh I had a lot more control on it uh I sacrificed distance but I wasn't in trouble every time I got down the fairway Uh-huh Oh yeah absolutely Yeah well I read recently here if you're scoring well you should play more If you're scoring poorly you should spend more time on the practice uh range Uh I think there is less frustration factor there too uh but I the one iron is something I've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that I should pick one up and try to start Apparently they're very difficult to play with but with practice I would imagine you could groove that swing too And I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron it's incredible and his accuracy is what's so startling with it And I but it's an iron that he's really practiced with He has used a lot and uh it would be fun to get that good with an Uh distance iron And get away without embarrassing yourself right
