All right Carolyn When do you are you reading the papers about the Middle East summit Yes I'm just a little bit too um I think I was worn out from Middle East after the war Uh-huh Yeah yeah Wha- That's I think uh I don't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back I think that's really uh really important I guess we grew up in such a different world I could never even imagine taking hostages But I think they just have a whole different world than we do so I don't know But I don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I think um I don't know uh I just have this civil rights mentality I guess You know should we or you know should we uh I wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do I guess that's what I hope for them But some of them don't want those freedoms I think their religious beliefs um may not you know they may not want it as a whole so I think that's something that has to be considered too But I think that's really a long term type thing I know that the it said think about long term repercussions and I was just thinking well peace is peace you know and that really is the nicest thing Uh-huh yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah I think so I think um And Right I think they realized we would probably never push him out and uh I think the other probably all of the other Arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out Uh-huh Yeah yep Uh-huh Yeah I think the thing is though I guess the Arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any ideas that coincide with the U S ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the Soviet Union And I guess that's all gone I think that's really uh probably what started the whole process I Yeah I think that they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support from the Soviet Union so I guess they're saying well you know we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries two ways We can either act like we're going to be pro-communist or act like we're going to be uh pro-democracy and whatever gets us the most honor that's what we'll act like we're going to do but we really won't change in the long run I think that's the way I sort of see them all working you know Yeah Uh-huh Yeah it's really funny as an American and always being an ally with the Israelis I always find it very hard in my heart to align with the Israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the Arabs you know But then again they have to live in that environment They have to be subjected to all of the Arab bombings and terrorist attacks and whatever Then they have to negotiate almost everything and then you think to yourself well you know in your heart you don't want to be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else but if that's the environment that they have to live in and survive in then you have to sort of like I don't know logically
