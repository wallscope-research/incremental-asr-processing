Well of course working That's definitely got to be the biggest thing is that everybody's out there working including me Well what do you think it is Yeah Yes they do Yeah they do Right Uh-huh yeah Yeah that's true It's a big change I'm an O B nurse and so I really do see what you're saying there It used to be that our list ran nineteen twenty twenty-one for our patients' ages And now our care plans look more like thirty-two thirty-three and if we get somebody twenty-one we go oh look how young So yeah you're right there's a big change and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties So it's true But again I guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers If they didn't have if they weren't out there working and having their careers they probably would be married and having their children So I guess it's a combination No go on Yeah Yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of mixed up families that's for sure Well just that I think the families the role in the family and the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children um we do it all I really think that and I know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers but I still think the mothers have the major role I really do I think they're not doing very much less I don't think as far as the kids and the house and everything are concerned not from what I see and they're contributing to the income besides I think that we're really putting a lot of stress on ourselves Oh it is Yeah Yeah it's difficult and I think that I live in Plano actually so it's a very wealthy town and we're not part of that but it is you know and I think what I see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better and I really hate that you know I hate to see that and I've been here for a very long time but um I don't know now I'm a single parent and I don't have a choice any more but I used to just work occasionally for extra money but now I have to work all the time and that's really hard and I don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work and leave the kids In a way it's very good to get out with adults and I think that's a good thing if you can do it part time But to just go out there forty hours a week at least and work and leave your kids to get home from school alone and that kind of thing I think that's not very smart I think that's difficult on them So Well it's going to be interesting Yeah I think it will change but I'm not sure how it's going to because you see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford to buy a home and to raise a family I don't know how they're going to do it And so I don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again I don't that ever will go backwards but I don't know what effect it's going to have on these kids now when they grow up how they're going to feel about it you know it could lead to another Woodstock type thing you know where there's just too much material things and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things and they might want to do without things rather than do that to their families It's hard to say Uh-huh
