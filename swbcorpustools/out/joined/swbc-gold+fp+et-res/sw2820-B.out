Yeah Um I also haven't thought too much about it Uh but I suspect it very much depends upon the job Maybe There are some jobs where I guess it doesn't really and if it's not affecting someone's performance then I'm not sure if it's a problem if it's a position where it could potentially affect slash error if Right Right And then if you're a computer operator uh there's really no big deal I think you know that maybe it's not necessary Huh-uh Yeah Well in that respect I think it may help a lot I think it may be hopefully push people away from drug use If they no that you know spelling:know If you use drugs you won't get the job I mean slash error Yeah slash error I don't know I don't know that would actually be an interesting thing to find out I think I don't actually know how long those things stay in the system I've heard some things will stay there for six months some stay for less some stay for longer Things like L S D I guess stay forever In some ways you get flashbacks for uh forever I guess so I mean there must be something I mean people get these little flashback things you know of some sort so I don't really know Right Well see if you actually used drugs at all and I'm at most a social drinker so it's never a problem Right Right that But that's a fine line to draw I mean uh that's really uh do you worry about you know this or that I mean you know what about the rights to privacy what if they're doing something legal but they would rather have it private you know Like especially in the case of drinking You know if someone is something more than a social drinker shall we say yet they're not an alcoholic what do you do So Well those are just yeah those are to get the shock value out of you Or just to see slash error Shock I'm a graduate student in Psych And we sort of you know figure out um I know a little bit about that kind of stuff What they're trying to do there is they want to sort of get a base line measure for you you know How is it that when you see these things and Yeah But with them they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping around and being fidgety Maybe It can be shocking and shock you Yeah Yeah well I guess so I mean I guess I don't know what actually happens uh if you have killed your mother Big jump there You know slash error But yeah I think it's their way of saying how well you do in a shock situation without worrying about stuff like that So slash error Yeah Yeah and I don't think that you killed your mother though I wouldn't worry about that Yeah Yeah That's uh you know it could blow things right away for them you know they could walk in and say look I did do drugs a year ago and I'm off them for a year now I'll be happy to take the test but it will show up positive versus Yeah Yeah although then they can't legally discriminate I think on the basis But I don't really know I don't know what the laws are pertaining to this My wife probably does I don't But it's an interesting topic that I never actually thought about Oh I Yeah Well these are tough I sort of like that stuff it makes you think So I think that's real good Nice talking to you to Bye-bye
