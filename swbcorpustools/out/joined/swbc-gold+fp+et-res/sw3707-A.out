Uh we have a Sheltie Collie a miniature Sheltie Yeah It's oh about six months old and we're try- we live in an apartment so we don't have a yard so it has to stay inside and we're having a difficult time trying to train it It's about six months Really But they're supposed to be real intelligent dogs but I guess or every once in a while you get one that's not so intelligent because this one it Uh-huh Yeah so how do you what's the best method Right Stand outside with them until they Well we're hardly ever at home so it's kind of difficult and you know you don't want to spank it or scare it or anything like that so Yeah we try to take it you know it gets frustrating when you take it outside you know and then it runs right inside and it does it Huh should be 2 utts; it appears that the "huh" is a br Yeah a lot of times and you know it won't it's little job outside and it comes inside Uh yeah we've tried that and uh you know there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go and he chews on plants and all that but you know that's natural for a little puppy Huh Oh really Oh that's sad How old is it Man that's sad Oh of course not I couldn't That is really sad what's the deal we're trying to take it on walks now you know and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash and so I mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to you know tug on it to walk it I mean it just goes like a mad dog I mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping and you know I mean it's not even close to even being trained on a leash Uh-huh Well we've heard some bad things about some of those you know they sometimes misuse their license or whatever you know they treat them bad Oh really Oh really Uh-huh How long did it take Every what Oh really Well Sheltie Collies are you know timid and they don't really unless they get used to something they're really nervous and Yeah yeah and uh if they're not accustomed to something they're really scared So
