Uh-huh Oh no I don't have any children but I'm still going to college Uh-huh N C State Um well it's a lot of work My Bachelor's Uh-huh Um it's actually in computer science and I have a special interest in Voice I O No I'm actually from Amarillo Texas originally Uh-huh Oh um the service Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Ooh It would have played a major part in mine Uh-huh Golly Yeah luckily I've paid in state tuition the whole time Uh-huh um Uh-huh The second thing is some colleges only offer the uh liberal arts uh whereas like State they offer engineering courses so depending on what your major is or medical you might want to um attend somewhere like Tech and um aside from the uh well some schools may even give you financial aid where another one won't Oh really Um Wow that's great Was it a Pell grant What kind of grant was it Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Wow Uh-huh Um Uh I'm not quite there's a lot of different organizations uh who do give grants but uh I'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how much you know they generally run Uh-huh Golly that's great Oh another thing I've got a degree from another college and uh something that might play a part is the size of the college Uh the smaller schools can give you uh a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy and they just give you a teacher's assistants you know instead of a scholar you get a T A and uh you don't get near the uh quality of education and as well the uh smaller schools often times don't cost as much Oh yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Um Um Oh at State I think it's just a waste of somebody's money to go there it's really a shame because of you know the instruction um I'd rather go to any other college you know in the state and I would definitely get my money's worth uh much better than State It's kind of unfortunate because they've just grown so big that they just don't care about the students any more Yeah they're bent on uh seeing how much more land they can get and uh how much of the campus they can build up and uh yeah it's really a bad situation here
