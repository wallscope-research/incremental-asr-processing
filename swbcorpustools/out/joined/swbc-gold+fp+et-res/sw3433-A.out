Okay What do you think of the public school system First off do you have children that are in it Oh okay Well then you should be a good one to know because my children are grown now I now have grandchildren in the school system so uh I don't have firsthand experience right now with it So what do you think Right That's right Right Yes it is I agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren we have a uh fourth grader and then we have one that's in kindergarten and I know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children were doing in the fifth and sixth grade You know it's amazing to me and stuff that I didn't do until I was in junior high which of course shows my age Is that scary Right Now Yes Correct Are you finding that uh since you're doing substitute that you're wanting to do full-time Um I have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms and d- do you find that Uh-huh Uh-huh Be uh-huh Coming up uh-huh Right Well I know that this friend uh is in the Plano School District and she teaches uh uh uh emotionally disturbed children And she says she has um six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade And she says she's getting very frustrated and very depressed because the school is pressuring her to pass them on even though they're not ready But because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something I didn't quite understand it And uh
