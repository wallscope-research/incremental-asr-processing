Oh okay so it's right up your alley then All right Yeah I don't think it's going to happen either but I wish it were because I got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering I'm at grad school now in acoustics and all we do is metric stuff Acoustics Yeah so everything's metric and then you go to read some order book or something and it's all confusing so I don't understand as much so I think we should get one adopted permanently Yeah a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to Yeah Uh-huh Yeah I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal I think people need to understand more like what a meter is instead of how many feet in a meter or something Just get used to using all the terms Because someone says a kilogram no one knows what that is Yeah Yeah no one seems to be adopting it Metric system uh no one wants it at all seems like Yeah Yeah it's pretty tough when you get everything confused though I think two systems is worse than one though Because I know we do a lot of problems and things and they're half english and half metric and you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems just get one I prefer metric but even if it's english they should just have one Yeah yeah I think so your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination Yeah Yeah they have some of those in Ohio There's this one sign's kind of funny It says uh metric signs next hundred miles Yeah that would force everybody to use it Or to quit selling tape measures in inches Yeah I guess a hundred is sixty-two Yeah you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety Yeah in the engineering they all do pretty much Oh in the elementary schools I don't know I wouldn't think so I remember a ways back we did like conversions but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system Yeah they learn how many centimeters are in an inch and that's about it
