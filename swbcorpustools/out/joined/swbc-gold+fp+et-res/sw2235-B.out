Hi Okay You want to start That is very true However our whole economy is based on loans Uh uh but bet right this moment you probably have several loans out or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something Master Charge But see our whole system is built on owing not borrowing Uh true But uh uh without it people wouldn't be able to own automobiles or they wouldn't be able to own a house Well now uh I agree with you one hundred percent I'm just taking the other side so we'll have a discussion here Uh but I still go to right back to what I said When is the time you had fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I have one way to suggest reducing the budget Very simple Just take all these civil service employees and uh uh take some of those holidays away from them like Columbus Day President's Day I mean they get all these days off Now give them what a week I think we here at T I get a total of eleven a year And that's about uh three or four less than civil servants get Now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off all those holidays Well now don't forget the mail is something else again That has nothing they're not civil servant people No no they have their own budget they go by No That's why the price of mailing a letter keeps going up You know I can remember the days when it cost only three cents to mail uh uh uh a letter Yeah They probably hey I ought to go looking through some of my old mail Well what about uh uh sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments How do you feel about that Well in so many cases it's not a loan it's just a give away No that's true I understand that France still owes us money from World War I And uh World War Two debts have never been repaid I think the U S just wrote them all off And said well we'll cancel it just like they did to that Polish debt here uh last week Uh uh half the countries of the world simply canceled the Poland debts to help them Uh-huh Well uh I've got to respect your opinion You have some solid ideas Well I don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world Uh that's asking for trouble People are too different I mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the U S and find a tremendous differences between the peoples They have their own ideas how things should be run So therefore I don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world There's too many societies involved uh the language barriers Uh oh sure somebody said years ago well let's make it English uh international language That's a big laugh we can't even make English a national language here in our country We've got too many uh uh immigrants They don't call them immigrants anymore that was back in my granddaddy's day Yes Yeah but My grandfather came over from Lithuania back uh just before the turn of the century and uh as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger He uh was supposed to serve some time Well he did serve his time uh in the militia And he came back He was a civilian again and his father said well if
