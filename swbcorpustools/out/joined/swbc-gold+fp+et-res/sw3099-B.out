do you work around children when you work With computers Okay do you ha- but you have friends that have children Uh-huh What is child care like in New York What is Does the company you work for have child care on premises for employees Oh Oh my A sabbatical Well I hope you can stay as long as possible with it Oh yeah that would be wonderful Right Right Right I think it does when they are real little and they are changing every day there's and you just miss the little things and uh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh That's right That's right That's right Right Right Well it is important for the bonding that they do it with the mother Right Our oldest grandson when he was eighteen months old went into a Montessori day care system And they took infants starting at six weeks and they have a program uh that was devised by this montessori person uh and a certain type of stimulations and there's times of day that even when the child is awake that they lay quietly and look at certain things they deliberately keep the room not real bright and uh they have different things they will put them down on the floor and of course they never have more than like five and they will put them down on the floor and I think one of them was a little mirror and some were just different objects that had a definite purpose for kids you know and there's something about their eyes Uh How old is she Oh yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Um A little older It is because that's when they are clinging to mama so you might have a real problem with that I think it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying so you know it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place But that's unusual Uh-huh Is it your parents or your husband's parents Oh Right right That's nice when uh I have three grandchildren another one coming in September and I if they were where I could not get my hands on them I am afraid I would probably go crazy You know I like that but if you do not have to put them in child care that's an ideal situation for you is to stay with them as or you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time that's wonderful for the child But Right And if you do decide to go with child care you really need to look at what your options are and look at what they offer drop in at times that are unexpected The Uh Uh Uh-huh uh-huh Oh Oh that would be wonderful Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Oh Right Right Right Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh I do too Really well trained people Right and have some kind of real good program set up so that when you go you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows C P R or first aid and have some kind of program set up like you say to stimulate the kids or educate them in some manner And have the you know the right toys and the right setting and uh have an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule you know that's real important to little kids Uh-huh they adjust to what the parents Uh-huh We- you know that works until they start school And that's a problem society is geared to a day person and it's I have another friend who's brother and his wife have done this they stay up until all hours of the night
