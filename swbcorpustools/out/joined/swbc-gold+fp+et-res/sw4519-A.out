Your turn Well I have to say I really don't have a budget Both my wife and I uh grew up in uh families of rather modest means and uh our family income at this point is comfortable Upper middle class I guess you might say And uh we're both so uh frugal that uh we really don't need a budget you know We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing Well we stay within our means but we don't do it uh by conscious effort It just sort of happens automatically Although we just moved to California and uh the cost of living here in California is uh I would say rather pathological Uh housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than uh uh <> they were where I came from in uh Dallas Yeah So uh uh that presents a real shock actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California but Yeah It's God's country Uh and one way you know that is that only God can afford it Uh so budget is not a problem for us Uh at least it hasn't been It may be at this point But uh up until this point it really hasn't been When I uh was in uh undergraduate school a long long time ago I uh noted that the starting average monthly <> salary for engineers you know in my discipline was like oh six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that And uh I noted at that point that you know if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever So I stopped worrying about money And it never have worried about money since then Sometimes uh it's a bit of a problem you know because I guess I don't really manage my money the way I should But uh I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of uh investments but Uh-huh Well I guess we're both lucky in that regard then How big is your family I see <> So how once you get ten children though you may have Oh all right I have two kids Uh one nine and one thirteen and they are beginning to be a budget problem but uh have not been really up to this point I give them an allowance {C and they uh I basically give my son ten dollars a week and I put half of it in the bank and I give him the other half in cold cash And uh he has a teller card so he can uh do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank But at least it isn't you know burning a hole in his pocket If he wants to use it he has to go get it and that usually
