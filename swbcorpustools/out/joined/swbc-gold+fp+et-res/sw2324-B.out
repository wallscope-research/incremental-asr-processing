No I don't like metric system I think the country is uh too ingrained in the inches and just the general uh background the history of our country has been inches and I don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system it's going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years and there are going to be people who die because of it because they don't understand uh you know simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and you know how far away something is and it's not in our national consciousness to do it We've always measured things in the English system and you know everything you know our land is in acres our people aren't going to understand what an amount of something is Yeah Yeah And it's easy to trans- we have a computer for just about everything now and if it's necessary to translate back and forth between them it can be done because I'm a mechanical engineer and I've had to work when I was designing packages for people I mean I had to work both systems back and forth and it was not hard and you can get a CAT CAM system that can take any design you want and you can push a button and it'll convert every measurement on there you know from one system to the other in seconds Really Yeah Absolutely Oh yeah it's just or even have had you know the chance to go to college or to learn about I think it's still good they do cover the system I think it should still be taught in schools And they do I know now because I even when I was in elementary school years ago you know we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and you know basically the other alternate forms of measurements things like that and that's acceptable Yeah <> Really You know you need twenty gallons but you need how many liters Yeah Yeah And it just doesn't make that much difference in the average life and the scientific community and places where it's needed you know that's fine and the rest of the world I mean we are it's not we may not be the top I don't know if we're the top we're one of the top superpowers of the world It may be arrogant but I mean let them come to us That's kind of the way I feel about it We can convert Yeah it's kind of like expecting everyone to suddenly speak German You know Yeah and instead of saying the world speak German we found out that we can translate And that's what I think we ought to do with the metric system Okay Yeah It's been nice talking to you Okay Yeah All right Well good talking to you Bye-bye
