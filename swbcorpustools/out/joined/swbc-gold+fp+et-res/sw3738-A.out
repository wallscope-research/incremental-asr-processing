Okay you ready to discuss the topic Okay the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in America and how they relate or how they differ today than they were ten fifteen or thirty years ago You ready for that Okay Pardon me Okay well there's uh it's kind of an interesting topic and one that I think is quite fascinating because uh couple of years ago I guess uh not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the United States but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in uh you know a very comfortable position so to say even though the cold war was in full swing You know you had the the Russians against the Americans the Communists against the Free World and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically not only on the political front but also on the economic front where uh couple of years ago uh America was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period We're also have a very humongous trade deficit uh and that's kind of frightening Also you know a couple of years ago ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life and thirty years ago that was basically it whereas now we're expected to have a career change  every + you know every couple of years and possibly four to five career changes throughout our lifetime and so I think uh you know things there's been an awful lot of social change lately and we- and uh Uh-huh Uh-huh True Uh-huh Yes yes True true Uh-huh Well do you think that's good or bad You think that's great That's some yeah because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position they're very comfortable they lose the ability to learn and they in a sense become unteachable They think they know all there is to know in the area set path and you know come in and put my time in from nine to five and when that's over with that's it without even giving a second thought to advancing their education or getting extracurricular um education and I think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also Uh-huh Right I agree with that I agree with that But I believe that uh an individual should really learn how to learn learn how to adapt learn how to grow in their college or whatever education they might take Well that's good that's good Uh-huh Yeah I read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress uh for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now That stress is a very prominent factor in the work place and it affects
