Well uh sort of mixed feelings about it I guess uh uh I lean more towards the control side than towards you know just the free army Uh on the other hand it's sort of an issue of uh I'm not a great fan of government control in general and so it's kind of a tough issue What about yourself Uh-huh I'm sure yeah Uh so you would take a position where somebody without a uh uh specific use in other words if they just wanted to have a gun to have in their home uh you wouldn't like them to be able to do that Is that Uh Yeah uh I have the impression that the majority of the problems that we have with guns are probably not from the people that are buying them through legitimate channels anyway Uh that may be wrong Uh you know I mean certainly there are cases you know children who find their parents' gun or something and shoot a brother or sister or you know things like that that need to be definitely avoided and that's certainly within the channels right But uh a lot of the crime I think that goes on I don't know to what the degree the guns are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh yeah I mean I think uh some sta- or I don't know if it's been actually been implemented I think so uh or at least there's been talk about doing uh you know like waiting periods and things like that Uh and uh you know I think stuff like that is perfectly good I mean basically you know if you're buying it for legitimate purposes waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem You know and things I don't know I've you know I don't own a gun and don't really want one and I'd just as soon a lot fewer people did Uh but on the other hand you know uh like I say I kind of against government control in general Uh Yeah and I you know something about banning is that you know there are so many weapons out there that they're not going to disappear anytime soon Uh and they're already I know there's a ready market for them you know in the s- the stolen guns can be sold I mean the first thing a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun Right uh because they they can be so easily sold and you know they're I don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country but uh it's not like they're going to disappear all of a sudden Uh even if you do do a total ban on them Uh it's a real tough problem I don't know I don't know where I really come down on it I mean I grew up my father was a hunter right and that's sort of almost a separate issue I think we've generally been talking about handguns and that kind of thing right You know and Uh-huh Um Yeah well you know we I grew up with them I never really took to hunting I mean I did some of it but uh you know we never had any handguns or anything like that We you know had shotguns for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that And you know it was a whole different thing and gun safety was taken very seriously and it was you know I mean before we go hunting we took safety courses uh you know and it but you know that seems to me to be just a whole another issue Uh you know the thing the yeah I'm not certain that people are terribly concerned about other people
