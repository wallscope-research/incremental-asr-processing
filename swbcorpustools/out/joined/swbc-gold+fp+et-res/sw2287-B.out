Yes uh uh I haven't missed a one since I've been eligible to vote Did you get to vote at the last one Oh uh-huh yeah and sometimes the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that uh they should be Right and uh there's usually nobody running against you know the incumbents Right uh but I feel that uh a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting And they're and also they're fed up with the system and they say well why should I even vote Right Right The lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it Oh I know it The last gubernatorial race oh it was awful So I don't know I it'll be interesting to see how the next uh few years go Yeah I think well it's definitely a problem and I think it could get worse You know we get this lackadaisical attitude and say huh you know why should we vote then you know uh it could lead to some serious things Uh-huh Right uh yeah uh yeah if we get someone in there like that then you know they could make all sorts of changes that they you know had enough pull Yes Uh-huh Yeah and uh who's the other guy LaRouche <> that uh is sort of the uh socialist not socialist but comm- he's so off the wall that uh he's gone in and tried to get into city elections uh but he's been put away for uh credit card fraud I believe Yeah Lyndon LaRouche that's it And uh yeah Uh-huh Right If you don't go and vote then you know very good chance that they will because a lot of the people like that they'll strike a chord you know in some of the people that so will say look you know this guy's got everything together You know I like what he says and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him And uh I think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana because um the guy did get elected correct That's what I thought uh but you know they can always fool us you know He might do a good job Oh yeah What we do usually is uh vote uh absenteeism  and uh I know here you know you don't have to have any reason you can just go and vote and the polls are open what was it a couple of weeks the hours are good and they're even open on Saturdays and a couple of Sundays And so we've got plenty of time to go because down here in Houston uh the lines are long uh but uh Well uh I recommend it because you just walk right on in and there's usually not anybody in line and uh you know that vote's just as good as you know the one on election day Uh-huh yeah Um yeah I've been involved with uh some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the Republican party And it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and uh uh the not the ballots but uh my mind has gone blank I've been all evening How they develop uh what the candidate stands for you know the views and uh you know everybody gets to vote on you know well should he be for this and on and on and on and uh it's interesting Uh-huh Right There for a while that worked uh I know I have um you know sometimes I'll stick to a certain party depends on the guy But uh if it uh gets down between two then I'll vote for the party because I know you know something about the other guy or you know they're both just as bad and I'll say Well I know what this guy stands for as far as for his party um but yeah You know that's not the best way but But it gets to the point where I mean you've got to find the time also to read about the guy and be able to find the information about what he stands for Right or what you've heard on T V which I think is just outrageous I don't agree with how the media handles elections you know I'm tired of hearing about the polls you know you know this is how he stands such and such a day the way they break it out it's just ridiculous Uh-huh it really could and uh then sometimes how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead and they keep dragging it on and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won Yeah so uh They really do I sometimes think that that should be limited more Oh yes or they I agree with the freedom of the press you know and all the amendments but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things No they don't Well I enjoyed talking to you All right Bye-bye
