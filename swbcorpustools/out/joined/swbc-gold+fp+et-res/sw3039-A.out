Okay we can start Hi I have four How many do you have Okay Okay Well no because mine are all grown So the topic for me I can only relate now to my grandchildren I do keep my Uh I do take care of my youngest granddaughter uh most every Saturday Uh my daughter and her husband work Saturdays My daughter is uh uh doing a schedule of uh twenty-four hours on the weekend but she gets paid for forty And Dave is uh in supervisory work and he has to work almost every Saturday so Uh She's three Yes she's little She's says how are you doing grandma today Whoa Oh no no no No she's my baby She's my baby yeah She was a miracle baby Yeah she really was Uh-huh Yeah Yes they do uh-huh They really do uh-huh Oh yeah that's really that's really wonderful Yeah Yeah Oh that's marvelous Well they keep you hopping I'm sure Well I know uh that uh one of the ladies I know they are very involved with their little girl and I think it's excellent because she's getting qualified quality time for uh her musical uh talents her sports abilities and uh I think because she is uh the only child that they concentrate uh they would like to have more but that hasn't been uh possible And uh she's tried many uh avenues and so now it's just you know that she's kind of resolved herself that yes this is going to be the only one And they're focusing on all of her uh welfare Oh okay Uh-huh Oh how wonderful That's wonderful Well that's wonderful Oh they are No Yeah you're Now I think everything is doing doing doing out of the house Which can be very hectic Yeah it wasn't so he- Uh-huh You have to look on that on the uh positive side of that Yes it is It's just a different lifestyle Yes Uh My uh second grandson is in A Cappella and I know what you're talking about when he's involved you know the children are involved in that and he's been he has traveled and they have won awards so I know  slash unit or part of previous slash unit  Yes slash problem should be ny Uh-huh And I know where you're coming from and it's very nice I think uh uh those type of children uh that are involved in things like that their uh goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things Right Going to Yeah a team effort yes That's wonderful That's really is nice to have in your background that you know then you can be very flexible And uh there's less uh friction involved in relationships when you add that skill of teamwork And uh I mean a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that And I think it's a a giant step of progress I really do So uh I The best of Well uh Cathy I think if you look to the Word of God and uh think on the things that are pure and lovely and uh keep your mind off of negative things And keep your mind on positive things and stress that to your children And uh even if they're discouraged tell them that that's just a passing moment and to dwell on those things that are uh not negative and that are positive things in their life and I think you'll see a lot of growth uh in their ability to uh control their thought pattern and when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God Oh absolutely That's right Uh-huh <> Right Well if she looks at it as you suggest that she can give her talent back to the Lord for His glory and she can look at it that way and uh that's
