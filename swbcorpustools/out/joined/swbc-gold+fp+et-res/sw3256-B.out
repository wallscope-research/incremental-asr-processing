Yes Yes Uh-huh Yeah I agree with you although I will say I'm not sure you know I sometimes have a problem with some of the especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have you know was because they were abused as children And the parents are saying Hey wait a minute we didn't do anything like that you know and I guess before I'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it it has to be an absolute certainty you know like uh caught at it or something you know or if they uh you know severely beat up on a child you know I would have absolutely no problem at all you know with I don't buy the routine oh they're just sick or they were abused when they were little well you know forget that Uh-huh Well but I can't see that either I don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any uh you know reason to not use capital punishment uh I think if I wanted to badly enough I could convince somebody uh I was crazy so my family may say that on occasion who knows you know uh I don't think it's that hard to do you know to convince somebody that uh Gee you just had no control over what you were doing Uh-huh Uh-huh That's the new one Well you're right uh and yet I mean did you ever in your life when you were little know anybody or hear anything of anything like this No Ye- well yes but I was from conservative Wisconsin and uh you know there was nothing on it which makes me wonder you know if it's as uh prevalent as some of them claim it's you just don't know and it all unless they're caught in the act or the child is very badly you know beaten up it comes down to a one word against the other that type thing Now Texas is capital punishment for it used to be just capital murder and now they added mass murder Are those the only two things that we uh uh you know because I have a feeling it is and I think there ought to be more things added to it Uh Yeah I you know uh killing a child or kidnapping uh and possibly not well I guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt you know if they release them two hours later he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty
