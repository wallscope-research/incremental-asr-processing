Okay I hope you know more about the subject of baseball and where they're going than I do beca- Well I of all the sports that there is I like baseball the best However I haven't been to a baseball game in years but I have kept uh my eye on the Rangers You know and I guess they were doing pretty good up to a point and then they kind of fell on their face Correct right They've got a one man show going there Which is interesting you know Um I guess he can really call down a salary They're so astronomical I can't even imagine that kind of money You know it's just uh phenomenal Well good I understand I understand Okay Uh you are involved with T Is uh speech um recognition How did you find out about it Oh okay I see Interesting Oh great I see Uh-huh Well that's good Well that's interesting And the topics are interesting uh they run a whole gamut of uh subjects and uh I think we can address every topic but the depth of knowledge is quite different So uh when they chose baseball I mean I can understand baseball you know I don't understand football Um you know uh it's such a rugged game that uh uh it seems to be too physical for my uh interest Uh-huh Well I can relate to baseball because I used to play baseball But I can't relate to football because I've never played football and don't have any interest and I said if I ever had a son he would not play football And uh I had four daughters so that wasn't a question but now I have a grandson that you know is gung ho for uh football And uh that doesn't please Grandma too much because the injuries uh can be very very devastating I understand that but I think they happen more in football I think the odds are cut down You know I know they can get hurt in baseball too The bat is a very heavy object can do a lot of damage but uh I think that they have a lower ratio of injuries in baseball Because the- Yeah A love for them Uh-huh I see Uh-huh did you sustain any permanent uh injury with that Oh Oh okay Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Oh boy Uh-huh Well uh I have a broken arm that I had since I was three It was never set right And uh uh I liked bowling as a kind of a relaxing sport And uh one of the men that was on our league uh noticed uh you know uh my broken arm and the way my ball would do And he says let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage And so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen I had my high game of two eighty-seven So uh yeah Um it was really funny you know that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and how to uh follow through with my uh addressing that to put the ball the uh pins So that was interesting So um I got a lot of uh recognition from uh uh the bowling league I guess I'm not sure where all my pins came from but it's but that was quite awhile ago and I never pursued it And a lot of people said well you should have turned pro And I thought no not m- m- I don't my love wasn't there for the game I liked to as a method of uh entertainment and I uh fellowship but outside of that no I didn't still I like to bowl but uh I don't have uh Jack standing behind me to tell me what to do No I'm not No No {F uh } at T I they have a junior league achievement and uh it's true bowling and I've never uh shared that with them I would have to brush up on my bowling before I even tried to uh win a lot of money for the junior achievement uh organization But that's the only thing that I would you know be to do Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh Still carries a good uh average
