Are you in the middle of anything The whole thing Did the framing and all Huh Maybe you and I should get together Because when I had my last big project I had the contractor do the framing slash error: two utts and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work Ye- Yeah My wife wishes I hadn't done that slash error slash error I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy slash error Yeah should be 'b' Did uh you framed in new square footage or was it stuff that was already uh enclosed Brand new and you knew how to do the framing Uh-huh do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground On the piers Did You had those poured or you did them yourself You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete Huh Well the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of No I designed it from scratch and did a pretty good job Those are nice They're pretty forgiving you know You can always tear stuff out and redo it It's a slash error Right slash error should be 'aa' Yeah I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and uh a backrest and all that stuff I slash error Yeah slash error should be 'ny' I had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes so we could pour concrete and support it with a nice firm four by four posts uh and then the rest of it I just did a contractor friend helped me uh with some of the uh foundation work but uh it was pretty it was about four or five hundred square feet The same size as the addition that I just put on so Yeah It's uh not that expensive I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and uh you know no less than that cost me about six hundred dollars all together Yeah I'd be surprised if it wasn't uh cheaper where you are Well yeah It probably comes from where you are Most When I drive through that area that's all I see is pressure treated lumber yards slash error Uh-huh slash error should be 'b' Right East Texas Huh Yeah my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard uh you know digging it out and laying sand and putting uh pavers on top of that so That's a lot easier
