Are you really Uh-huh which are both kind of small Uh-huh Are you looking for an American car or you open to buying foreign cars Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Personally I have a Japanese car right now and I really like it a lot Uh I think the Japanese really build good cars and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole uh you know buy American keep American auto workers working right now but I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while If I were to buy another car uh I would be partial to buying another Japanese car but I would also look at American cars but when I bought the car that I bought now I did that also and I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product So if I were Right Right it is Uh I'm kind of right now the next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car I would really like to have a sports car Uh I don't have a family so I don't need a mini van or such to uh haul people around in So I'm looking for more a two passenger car that uh Well I like the Miata but I don't like it enough to buy it I would buy something actually the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon which is an American car But uh something along that lines Uh because I have an economy car right now which is okay but uh I think I'd like to move on to something a little better Right Right That's when I bought the car that I bought I was looking for mileage and I was looking for uh dependability and something that was going to last a long time for the money that I was going to spend that I would get a return that was worth that money So Right exactly Yeah That's right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Okay Uh uh I've had one or two American cars I think and they were okay I had a Pontiac once and I never had a problem with it but uh my mother had a Dodge at one point and I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from well actually I had uh a Dodge Omni at one point and that was I think what really prejudiced me against American cars because I did not feel that it was a very quality uh car So I guess you'd have to say if I was looking I would definitely be looking for a foreign car Uh-huh Right Which is a good deal Uh-huh Right Yeah that Yeah I'm sure they did Uh-huh Right
