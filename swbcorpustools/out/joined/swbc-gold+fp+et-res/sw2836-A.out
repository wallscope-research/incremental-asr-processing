Okay Uh far as you know crime in the cities I'm sure like in yours it's pretty bad Uh probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have How about you Uh-huh probably right if you look at it from that stand point What uh is there anything uh that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing Uh-huh Do you live in a real small town or out in the country How far out from the city I mean do you About fifteen miles I live in a little suburb uh which I guess from Dallas is twelve miles or so but it's pretty congested We are considered in the country but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country Our major crimes in our immediate town uh is probably house robberies and very few instances of you know alcohol drugs uh reported However I'm sure they're there But uh right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their uh existence in that neighborhood And since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms uh and including uh the outer perimeter type uh devices sensors and things like that It's cut back you know considerably but it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood so it still uh remains city wide pretty high Uh I would say the majority of it's happening during the day uh between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon Most Well most families are young and both people are working So they're happening during the hours they're gone from work Uh so uh I would say that's probably their prime motivation they'll stock your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there Uh they classify most of them as professionals Uh you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking uh you know just junk items that they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick Probably the biggest items uh that you get in our neighborhood would be the high classed automobiles the you know Mercedes Volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets guns that sort of stuff Very few you know penny ante stuff Well uh the police force for one I think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use Uh it's oh right now I think we are about thirty thousand people and there's only eight officers that patrol for that amount of people which is not very many And Well the course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever so they're giving the early release uh Yeah and it's I think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences uh but for the That would certainly be a deterrent And uh not necessarily you know give in to their uh human rights desires You know if they're overcrowded just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate Uh Uh I think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty you know in a lot of cases Course I know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof Uh I'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody and then those convicted especially of you know murder and uh you know major crimes uh to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through with that Uh especially you know in the case of murder uh I know in my case my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty-five and the individuals got caught uh we went through the court system and all that sort of thing and uh you know two counts of kidnapping uh you know the forty-five to the head you know just the mental anguish and the whole nine yards uh you know the guy only got five years And you know he was out within two months because of the parole system So what Do what now no I'm not real familiar with that Oh Well the insurance companies and all that tried to go after him and they said well you know he has no job he has nothing there's nothing that he has that you could go after Yeah Uh very seld- Yeah They don't do that here Course they pay them but you don't you or the insurance companies never see any of that money uh you know and right now they're reluctant to go after him because they're repeat offenders they uh been in jail before they've been released you know several times which is another uh deal I hate to see But uh you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes uh and car theft on top of it destroys my car and we're out you know uh you know fifteen thousand dollars and you know the guy gets out in two months and he goes out and commits it again Fact he's back in jail now So what uh Yeah what deterrent does he really have Yeah I think in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real possibility Uh we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually you know shot the people and uh return offenders have they've actually waited for them where they've robbed you know particular neighborhood they'll rob one house then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else try to take it in their own hands Course it doesn't always work out in their favor But uh nevertheless I think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of us you know you can get some of us you can't get all of us Uh and we're beginning to see more and more of that Yeah Yeah I mean that's certainly a possibility in we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death And uh it helps for a while but then just another different set of people come in and most of the people are transients from outside of the state Uh I would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught they're from places like up in Oklahoma and Louisiana Arkansas you know across the border So you know people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever it's not many from the local communities But uh it's a problem and I think that the court systems need to be more stiffer in their penalties would be a definite deterrent and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they catch these people Right Uh-huh I know like in my wife's case they made her feel like the criminal they went to all
