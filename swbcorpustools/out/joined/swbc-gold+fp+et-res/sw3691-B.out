Uh pets Do you have pets Oh my goodness We have three dogs and two birds at this point Parakeets Oh have a ball with them Well no because my dogs chase them So in order to have the birds not stuffed I have to keep them in their cages Uh-huh Uh-huh Well we had that happen once um my son had the bird back in his room because well the first one that we had was his bird and I had a ceiling fan put up and the bird got away from him one afternoon and I mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall I thought oh so much for the bird No he's still alive and kicking No I guess we didn't have it high enough or he didn't get hit in just the right spot but it threw him up against the wall you know and he slid down the wall Oh gosh slash error Oh I hate them sd Oh my goodness You're kidding Oh well that's pretty good Oh yeah oh yeah Oh you're kidding Oh Oh my gosh I can not ima- I don't in fact my brother has uh a exotic pet shop out in California and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail you know I'm going don't do that because they won't come in my house Uh-huh Oh my gosh Oh my gosh That is wild Oh I just can't do those and the lizards and all those things they need to stay outside far away from me Yeah Oh yeah they are so expensive Well my son was just dying for a bird and I'm really allergic to them so I try to stay away from them except I've gotten real attached to this one and uh we went down to Canton one time oh gosh two or three years ago now and he'd saved up his allowance you know and picked him out a bird in a bird cage and that stinking bird when I brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you clamped onto my finger and would not I mean I had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage and he has tried to bite me for two years and all of a sudden this bird and I have become wonderful friends He gives me kisses he talks now and it's just hysterical I'm the only one that pays attention to him And I'm a substitute teacher and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said <> my mom's making me get rid of the bird we have too many pets I thought yeah right come tell me about it you know They knew the sucker when they saw one So now we have two parakeets
