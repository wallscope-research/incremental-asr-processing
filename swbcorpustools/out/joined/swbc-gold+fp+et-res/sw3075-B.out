Lynn do you want to start Okay Do you want to tell me about summer vacations you've taken or Uh-huh Which is your favorite Uh-huh Your family doesn't live close then Okay Yep I understand Wow I've only been there once and I'd love to go back And it was Yeah it we had a great time Well uh we as you do take family vacations uh sometimes one a year but this year we're not going to be taking one for several reasons But vacations we really enjoy I think we've been on three cruises And we really love cruises We've gone on CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES And uh we've gone fairly inexpensive as most cruises go Uh we usually book just a month before it's ready to go And we get upgraded last two times in fact we had an outside room and it was beautiful And we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around It's kind of Oh my God you do everything I mean you can be as busy as you want to be or as laid back as you want to be You can sit in the sun all day around the pool or you can take part in the games that they have going on They always have bingo They have a casino Uh they have a massage parlor They have exercise I mean you can do anything And that's just aboard ship And then when the ship docks you get to go sight-seeing and shopping And that's quite fun Uh Nassau San Juan Saint Thomas We've been there twice We went two cruises that hit those islands but with different people we've gone with friends each time And then we went to uh the western Caribbean which is uh Port uh Cancun Cozumel and Ocho Rios Pardon me Yes uh-huh but it was wonderful So we really like those And uh I guess we just like to go someplace entirely different We've been to a few places in this country We still have a lot to see though We're from Illinois originally And we've been down in Texas eighteen years and so like you we always try to make it you know back home to see the relatives We both still have family there And that's fun It brings back a lot of memories Uh things are different there though They're uh I don't know It's just entirely different world than this area Did you Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh that's great Oh they really are yeah as I said we've done them three times We'd be going again this year if circumstances hadn't changed we'd probably go My husband would you know the minute I said the word he's chomping at the bit He kind of likes the casinos a little bit But I like all of that I like seeing other countries and shopping in other places I like shopping I can shop anyplace shop in London and France and wherever Now my kids are moving to Toronto so we're going to be able to go up there So I'm kind of looking forward to that except I hate to see them go But Oh that's what everybody says and I think it's I think I'll try to stay away except my second grandchild will be born in the winter in January So that will be hard to stay away from Yeah Isn't that the truth uh-huh Well there's all age groups too and that's kind of fun Uh if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals you meet different people You may meet people you know thirty years older than you or younger and everybody is really interesting and everybody is there to have a good time and Uh we've only gone on the seven day cruises They have shorter ones and then they have ten day ones But I think seven days is long enough for us By that time we're ready to get home and get back to our routine I think most vacations uh seven days is enough for us We've gone I think when we went to England and France we were there ten twelve days and that was pushing it a bit Yeah Well that makes sense it really does I mean oh we went to Panama too Went to Panama last August Our son-in-law is from Panama And uh we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents who live there And his father is a doctor and his mother is a kindergarten teacher and they took time off it was their winter and they were having a little break so they took some time off that uh they could show us around And it is a beautiful country It is beautiful They have mountains We were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore And it is gorgeous They live in a small town called David which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica And uh it's just a gorgeous country Most people don't realize it I think if they could get tourists coming to their country they'd improve the economy considerably Yeah We really hope so Yeah Well that's pretty good That's pretty good Oh do you like L A
