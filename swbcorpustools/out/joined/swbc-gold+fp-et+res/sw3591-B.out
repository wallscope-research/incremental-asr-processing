Do you have uh some strong feelings one way or the other about about the care of the elderly Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes Yeah yeah Well my graduate work is in speech pathology and uh so so uh I've thought about this more than once uh you know dealing with uh you know I'm concerned we're going to have a geriatric uh population in in twenty years it's going to be you know phenomenal Yeah yeah Uh and um but I have been amazed and and in talking with uh some of my fellow students it looks as though um nursing homes are not going to be the only option any more and uh in twenty years Uh where a lot of students are hoping uh to work as an in the home type uh uh approach where where the uh where there's you know the speech therapist or whether it's a nursing specialist or someone plans to uh work out of a family's home and take the responsibility away from the family but yet allow the the loved one to stay you know at home with the family members Uh it's it's difficult for many families especially in the case of uh of Alzheimer's and and uh some of the more degenerative diseases to uh say uh uh leave them to have them at home because then the family becomes completely uh exactly Yeah and and did did you experience that with your with your father or not Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Right Oh Uh-huh Yeah Definitely You know one of the other subjects on the switchboard and this is one that I've been thinking applies here uh where where uh young young kids uh graduating from high school whether they should do a community service type work This would be an excellent example of some where uh some place where um the community could be more involved you know more than just leaving it only to professionals There is a lot the community the community can do to uh enhance the or or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home Possibly before I don't know now Uh-huh Huh-uh Uh-huh I agree That's a that's a good point
