That's right that's right You know what what uh what do you think is important If you were uh I don't know how how old you are but if you had if you had uh parents say or or or th- grandparents whatever it is uh who were ready who who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for Huh Yeah Yeah Huh Well my uh uh my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in uh Minnesota and we go there uh once a year We see we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston so we're pretty far away When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her And it seems uh the the environment there I don't know too much about it but it it seems nice enough Uh it it's hard at least half of the residents I would say are not not mentally sound So it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to r- to retain uh clarity say uh you know Yeah Well I I don- I don't know We we also my wife and I uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that's just a mile from our house We uh she goes more often than I We used to go once a month once every two months to visit some of the patients there And we'd take we have a two year old son and so we sometimes we'd take him with us And uh there I would say it's the same thing It's it's a nice uh relatively nice environment but again um it must be depressing for the people who who are who are just e- e- essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but but certainly uh certainly have ar- ar- are have retained all of their uh mental skills and so on It's must be depressing to to walk walk the halls and see an- and see all these other people who really don't know where they are I think yeah I think they're relatively re- respectful Yeah and and concerned that in as much as they can be I I think sometimes you know I've noticed uh people asking for uh some of the patients asking for things uh just repetitively and but things that are not reasonable and so at some level the the the uh I'm sure that the that the uh the staff l- learn what's normal for this person and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just you know is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need you know Oh yeah Yeah I'll tell you one thing though that'll that that I I saw that was really nice We saw a husband and wife we used to see a husband and wife in there uh together and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were but these two were And when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house And so Yeah you walked in there and it didn't look like uh you know how yo- you you walk into some rooms and there's it's completely generic There's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person and that's it But this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that and they had all their stuff from their house and it looked like uh i- i- it must have been it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them and it must also give them a sense of uh uh security and and uh and and you know s- s- uh Yeah Huh Yeah Huh temporary I that that's that's new to me I Right right
