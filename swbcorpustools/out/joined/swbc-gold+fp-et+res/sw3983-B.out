We take several at home I I take um SKIING MAGAZINE and I take uh DISCOVER magazine and also uh C D AND STEREO REVIEW and NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC I think and BOYS LIFE I presume that I do Uh I suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth because I do get things from ski associations and things uh at during the year Uh not so much that I uh more likely to see those at a ski show or something but um <> I just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go and and new equipment that's come out and so forth Some fashions are always in there too Probably not Uh we already knew we wanted to take one and we just started looking around I may have referred to a couple of them but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information picked up a lot of brochures and just decided to go to Crested Butte We haven't been there before Kind of away from the crowd is why we chose that one It's supposedly low lift lines But I haven't skied Utah yet but I want to I'd like to go to Sundance and Park City and some of those I understand Deer Valley is nice too Well how about you what what magazines do you have at home Oh okay Does it have uh articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth Well that's good It's good to get use out of one I'm not sure that um in the case of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC I read it but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find you know France or something or whatever it is he's looking for I used to take SMITHSONIAN too I liked that magazine but it was I was just found myself not ever getting around to reading it You get so many coming in and by the time the next round comes in I'm still not through reading the first round Oh SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house too I forgot and that's mostly my son's but but I do read it too And he takes GAMES MAGAZINE GAME MAGAZINE which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve you know crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that he likes to try that so He does uh does get to be a lot of paper though after a while if you don't keep them weeded out they almost take over Oh yeah they're just kind of getting started now Mine is a senior in high school so he's we're kind of at the end of that trail You're just sort of beginning to think about first grade Oh okay so you got a little bit of a gap there between
