Yes I actually get most of my news coverage off uh computer networks However I do also watch television news uh usually in the morning once a day and I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL most every day Uh well well DOW JONES for example have the cause the uh news wire and it's picked up and actually available uh at my office so it's no fee or subscription either to read at my leisure and it's sort of by category For example so I can read a certain business or topics Well uh it's similar to that but it's DOW JONES which is uh the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire Uh well actually not Uh I do uh follow uh uh uh I don't know how to how to describe it so I'll say a religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense It's a weekly but uh but not uh not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things I'd like to say that however uh that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires Uh I think that it I think that it has to do with uh I personally think uh I I have a problem with their viewpoint and I personally think that uh ther- that there's a strong bia- there's a strong bias in the media Yeah Absolutely Uh after all who who writes People who are journalist who are trained to write and they're that's a liberal uh a liberal field at least from academia and uh the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in I find their descriptions to be wrong and it That's right Well even if it's not technical If it's uh some social thing or whatever It doesn't matter If I am an expert in it they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think I'm not expert in it They're telling me lies Uh I think both Uh by deliberate I uh I mean mistake mistakes of omission or uh or uh biased toward a particular view point a particular liberal view point that they have So uh uh to give you an example uh we will go out of the printing media I know of cases where uh we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you Which is sort of like a deliberate bias Which is which is rather disturbing he does that Yeah I don't have access either Although I did at one time and it was I did during the Gulf War and it was addictive Yeah well during that small sample I would think that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks radio television programming So if at a particular time you wanted to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by uh turning on C N N and you
