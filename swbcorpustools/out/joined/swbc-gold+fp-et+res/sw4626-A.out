Okay Yes Yeah Well i- I I I feel like uh I am from Mars I'm fifty years old and uh I've been divorced for um eighteen years But I've two kids and all But I uh I I've never had a budget and I don't uh do any planning and I don't know I don't uh uh I don't have a long-term financial plan I don't try to control my expenses But I'm I'm glad you're a stranger But really I'm I happy I I well I'm curious how other people live Uh so maybe we should start with you What do you do Really Oh Maybe they're going to arrest us both Wow Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh The uh I had a part-time job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy-six and uh uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time and so I was willing to take a half time job to do that And I actually did my bank account would uh I'd I I kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month but I I had miscalculated I well I didn't keep a balance It's one of the problems <> I never had to in the past I always kept plenty of money in my checking account but when you're only earning half the salary Even though I wasn't spending much money I sometimes I sometimes would just things would get to tight Uh and sometimes what I would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet and every time I uh I spent money cash mostly I would uh write it down so I could see at the end of a month how much I spent on food so I could do better planning But I would forget to write the things down and it that I I don't know if I ever went as far as three months or not i- i- in keeping that kind of data I certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh The uh I i- I have to say that let's see at this point on I don't run out of money Uh and it uh a- and I don't someday if I were to get remarried I might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which I don't have and I I I think my strategy if if I may i- i- is to is to not spend money I don't have expensive tastes I don't go out I buy a car well the last car I got rid of I'd had it was nineteen years old Pe- people were embarrassed for me it was it was a good car and Oh it was great My my mechanics loved it because it was an old it was a sixty-five Buick and it just wouldn't stop Uh and it I I just didn't feel the need for a new car It isn't like I couldn't afford one Uh and now I I don't uh I tend to eat expensive food I don't mind buying a good steak but for me I only do that every week or without even maybe once a month you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound You buy a a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars To me I realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that But but I'm just I'm just saying as a single person that's that's a drop in the bucket And so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up If you're buying if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which I don't care to go to So so that's I think one of the reasons I don't need to budget is that I don't have I don't I don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because I can't afford it because I'm not interested in that expensive thing
