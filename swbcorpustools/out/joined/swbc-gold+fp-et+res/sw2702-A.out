Well as much as I'd uh I'd like to say that I'll be looking for a flashy convertible or uh or a four by four or something I guess the next car I'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door Oh we've got a uh an older Delta Eighty-Eight and then uh our our newer car is a uh a Corsica And we'll probably be looking for something about that uh that same style That same kind of four door hard top style Uh no but we're planning for it So uh in fact uh our Oldsmobile is a is a like an old Delta Eighty-Eight but it's in pretty good sh- in really good shape And we've been really pleased with Oldsmobiles So that's probably where the first place we'd look But uh Uh-huh That'll do it Yeah Uh-huh  Oh geez Uh-huh Yeah Really Uh-huh Oh geez Uh-huh Yeah yeah Uh-huh Yeah Sounds like you you need at least like a Taurus size or something like that Yeah I I know a lot of guys at work they uh the ones that have uh families uh and they still want kind of a sports car They've been uh a lot of them have been getting these Taurus S H O's That I guess it's the sports version of the Taurus In fact it comes with a standard stick and uh and a lot of those And it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that But uh and usually they're in like black and gun metal grey and those kind of colors You're not going to see too many uh you know green ones or blue ones or anything like that They they put them in sporty colors I guess But uh Oh well sure That's what you know until until you look at the price tag and then you go What What would I besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun what would I really do with this car Yeah I I went I went through that when I first got out of uh college I had an old car that I bought just to get to to my j- my first job And when I got there the first thing I did was trade it in on a Spitfire And I I knew that was going to be the only time I could afford a two seater uh sports car But that that just does not make it as an only car It's uh it's like I I would I bought a set of stereo speakers and it was one of those cash and carry deals I had to take them one at a time with the top down And it was winter so I was in like this coat with the top down and the speaker in the passenger seat And I drove that one home and then I went back and got the other one and put that in the passenger seat and drove that one home And uh funny funniest sight And da- you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car Uh-huh Yeah Oh really Yeah Uh-huh Boy that's a good deal Ah okay Well I'll have to remember that if I ever get in that situation again Huh Because I I know we've uh that's that's something that that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission My uh my wife just does- can't can't uh she really doesn't want to learn I guess the uh the standard shift I fact I I remember once we uh we uh went uh went on a uh test drive We got one of these things from Lee Iacocca that said you know I'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll test drive a car And we went uh we went uh we went to a dealership and uh it it was prev- she she did pretty well But it was one of those things where we just went to a big parking lot and the uh dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking because that was all it was It was it was the funniest thing it was like uh a big Le Baron it was a Le Baron with everything on it but it had a standard shift It was the craziest thing I ever saw And and and that's probably why they were trying to sell them I guess And uh we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth She did pretty well after a while But uh it's just kind of hard to learn I guess Uh-huh  Um okay Oh geez Yeah yeah Oh well Well I guess that's I guess that's about all I've got to say about cars Uh-huh Uh-huh I would think so yeah because it's so big Oh yeah Sure sure Uh-huh Uh-huh Now now now that used to be a luxury but I bet on the next time you buy a car that's going to be mandatory You've got to have that now You're used to it and you got to have it Yeah That's true too It It probably does it probably does But uh Oh well Well Bill it's been nice talking to you Okay you have a good evening Um Bye-bye
