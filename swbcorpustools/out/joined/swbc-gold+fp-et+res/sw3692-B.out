I'm sure well actually probably any government but the federal one's the big one So uh so what do you what do you think in the short term we should be doing to to improve it Right Right Yeah Uh yeah I'm getting pretty kind of disgusted with the uh uh you know the fact that they're counting a reduced deficit as being some big step Right first of all we were we've already hit the largest deficit this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever and two a deficit is the deficit is only uh is is as far from a balanced budget you reduce the deficit you you're still not you're still not you're still overspending Right it's just the amount that you're overspending and this is you know for some reason the way that the reporting is going on now it seems like like the goal is to reduce the deficit to some you know still outrageous amount um Yeah I I I think in the long term something is going to have to be done with uh sort of the the uh well it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process right that you've got uh people you know trying to trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected And uh there isn't any sort of overall accountability and and uh I don't know I I suppose that that that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're going to have is is is exposure and information And I don't know that in general the American people are that interested you know to listen to to as much uh uh you know you're going to have to know what people are doing and uh you know and how and how how partisan and how and how self-interested their their motives are and and take it to task for it because it's not going to get solved you know if people are still trying you know like you were saying you say you know hey we just you know we just cut defense let me grab some of this money for my state now and then we can throw in some highway bill or you can throw in some you know some other kind of thing and uh it's a pretty vicious uh vicious cycle I don't know That's yeah that's being batted around I uh my my dad was always a pro- proponent of that He uh he felt that that would get people involved who were who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants Uh-huh Right Right Uh-huh Right Uh-huh yeah Right Yeah yeah I think I think that that's probably right because in terms of long term you just got to get people um uh at one point at least on a local level um going into politics is you know what you're doing is is really trying to serve the community right you don't expect to make any money out of it You know maybe you gain a little bit of local fame but but it's uh you put in a lot of work in exchange for that And I don't have the feeling that national level politicians are are at all like that Yeah And uh you know I think that that that the problem with having you know junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with uh you know with in- inept politicians or people who don't know how to deal with it But on the other hand maybe that's
