Okay Oh No Right Yeah uh I know Di- is easy to find pa- uh painters to do this for you Ri- are you talking outside or inside Exterior yeah Yeah Yeah Well when we've painted um right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front so there isn't as much wood that has to be painted Um but i- it the problem is that it hits the sun hits it So preparing is a real problem you've got to prepare it well or else it will flake Um Wow that's quite a range Yeah Yeah which might be a bigger problem than it would be uh Yeah absolutely No we 've have uh done a little painting ourselves um we painted the bedroom uh well within the last t- couple of months and we have we have some more that need to be done but the the problem that we've we've owned this house almost five years now and um when we bought it the um it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired but the daughter was a real estate agent and she was selling it and it's been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house So she told us that the house had been uh professionally painted recently And it looked pretty good you know the uh the interior walls all basically white but they obviously had been done without to much uh wear afterward The only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood- uh the door frames when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it Big long strips So what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly And some of still has to be redone Yeah well no actually it had been uh it would have been it had been a repaint job But they had not either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they because it was woodwork so it looked as if it had been painted correctly with you know uh an enamel or something but um it had not either that or it had not been prepared underneath and it was greasy or something it comes off in strips not even little bit So we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time we know what a job it's going to be because you almost have to strip the whole thing in order to do it again Okay Thank you Bye
