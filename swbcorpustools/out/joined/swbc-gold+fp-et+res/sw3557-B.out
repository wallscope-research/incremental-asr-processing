You think about AIDS research Uh-huh Um well I'm certainly in favor of AIDS research and I think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does I think that because besides the fact that it's a deadly disease that it's a contagious disease so that it's um although it is not killing that many people now it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem Uh-huh That's in the world or in America You Oh really Um that's Whose figure is that Okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh I I think they should actually although prob- perhaps not a an incredible amount more than what they're doing and I don't necessarily think that they should uh fund AIDS research and in the process neglect cancer research or whatever I think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general Um well I well I am sorry that he has the virus I um I don't know I don't I think it's very strange that the media hasn't um questioned him more strongly to about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that as they probably would for a lot of other people Um well not not really though I think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position but I don't think it's anything exceptional that he's doing It's what many people have done already who were just less famous Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that's good Uh-huh Uh-huh Um yeah I do My cousin does for instance And um Yeah yeah it is He's actually um he had AIDS related complex for a while and he is now in full-blown AIDS really not doing very well and has a brain tumor or some- that sort of thing Yeah it's it's a very nasty thing Um yeah that's that's basically it that um the immune system can at first slow down and the white blood cell count goes down which is that's AIDS Related Complex but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom that's AIDS and in that case you know people are prone to getting any kind of you know weird cancer that only animals got before and yeah that sort of thing
