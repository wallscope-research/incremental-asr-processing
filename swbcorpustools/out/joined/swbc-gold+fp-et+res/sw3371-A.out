So what kind of a house do you live in Uh-huh Well our home is uh probably for our area it's probably one of the lower income homes out here Uh most of the the homes that they're building well I shouldn't say all of them but most of them now are up in the millions of dollars Oh yeah there's We have got about uh twenty I'd say about twenty-four hundred Uh we've got five bedrooms because we built onto our garage A a bedroom for my mother and uh Oh Oh that's great Well this this house is very comfortable We've got two living areas and that that's the thing I probably like the most about it It's just one story Yeah It's a Fox and Jacobs home Um we've been real happy with it Of course I'm not a carpenter or anything like that They could probably come in and say gee this is not straight and this is under something but No No we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all No We've been real lucky So Yeah Oh yeah Yeah I I've heard a lot of people say that That's for sure Uh we have an attic that we've just put you know plywood ove- over the beams and things up in the attic and so that has replaced it to some extent but certainly not Uh in parts you couldn't you really couldn't use it for a room Yes Yeah Yeah we uh we've got you know I'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there Two living areas We have a living room and dining room at the front of the house and then we have a the uh family room kitchen and playroom at the rear of the house which has been really nice In fact I really enjoy the playroom that y- you would think that would not be a real bonus you know to a house but of all the rooms in the house I'd say that was that was the one that's been really nice to have I think that's true Yeah Probably our family room is the the biggest Uh Yeah Yeah Well that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is but it is nice to have it because there's uh with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment So Seventeen years Uh-huh Oh wow Oh uh-huh Yes it is Uh-huh Well that's interesting Yeah Uh-huh Well my husband wouldn't do that anyway That's his that's his worst thing in life is to have to repair something So Well uh that's great We just kind of save everything for when Al uh for for when his Dad comes to visit and then he does all the repairing you know he does
