Okay would you uh like to begin or would you like me to start Okay Yes Uh-huh Yes I agree Right Right I agree with that I I think you do see more and more women out there in politics too as mayors or uh you know in in helping to maybe uh get some legislation passed to to have women have more rights I think still even with that whole um thing with Judge Thomas and and uh you you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man or something the way they had the trial and uh I just think that it's it's still going to take another generation or so before before the women really could really feel that they're really equal in the business world and that they work just as hard or harder Uh but it's still uh going from from homemakers into uh corporate leaders is still a big step Right Yes I think it's true I think also people are having children at a older age so it's maybe like uh you know you go through college and then you maybe work for a few years and then you have your first child and uh  you know you you know  both sides of the coin You know what it's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly and to take care of the kids And and then uh maybe people that are just working and think oh you just stay at home But then when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid it's like they lose it They say wow This is harder than I thought Well you know I know it I know Uh-huh Are so involved Yes Right right Their role has to change to kind of accommodate us too I know I have three children and my oldest is eleven and I've pretty much been home uh since Brian was born and uh just recently I went back to work uh last school semester to tutor uh high school age students with learning disabilities and I was just out of the house two days a week but I thought wow this is really hard only and it was only two days and I was home before three But getting the baby to day care getting the kids off to school I still did everything I always do you know my husband still got up and went to work but uh it it only those two it made a big difference I thought wow full time I don't think I could swing that personally Oh Oh boy Pick up Dinner Right I bet I bet Well I I know a lot of people I know I had my first child when I was twenty-five and that's not considered really young these days that's almost you know but uh I have friends that that have kids just starting kindergarten and they're they're forty years old And and then like maybe a two year old at home and I think boy I I'm I'm in my thirt-
