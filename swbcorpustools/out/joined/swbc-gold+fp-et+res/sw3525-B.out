I think golf isn't it Are you a hacker I know I Oh I know I did I know I did Course I know I watch my thirteen year old play now you know and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body Uh-huh Sure Yeah That's what it takes you you need to play that often to get a really good handicap Well I went to I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more and I I went after it and did and I really didn't find much improvement Fact ever time I'd start trying to correct something it seemed like the score would listen go go back up yeah I I think I need to uh I probably need to take some some more lessons uh more current and uh and practice more often Spend more time on the Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah Oh yeah I'm familiar with it Oh yeah if you play regular I think it makes a big difference Yeah yeah I well I've also found too I I try to work out regularly and when I am doing that uh and feeling loose and that I swing better I I I get through the ball better Uh and I also if I I found as I've gotten a little older here I worry less about my distance And I my control is a little bit better there Uh so Uh-huh Uh-huh Have you ever have you ever tried a one iron Uh-huh Well you know I put mine back in my bag this year too and I I used a three wood rather than a driver Uh I had a lot more control on it uh I sacrificed distance but I wasn't in trouble every time I got down the fairway Uh-huh Oh yeah absolutely Yeah well I I read recently here they say if you're playing if you're scoring well you should play more If you're scoring poorly you should spend more time on the practice g- uh range Uh I think there is less flus- frustration factor there too uh So but I I the one iron is something I've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that I I should pick one up and try to start Apparently they're very difficult to play with but with practice I would imagine you could groove that swing too And I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron it's incredible And but and his accuracy is what's so startling with it And I and it but it's an iron that he's really practiced with He has used a lot and uh it would be fun to get that good at a with an iron Uh distance iron And get away without embarrassing yourself right
