Well I'm kind of leaning towards I don't know I'm thinking about what from one to ten what my no would be It would probably be somewhere closer to uh less control because I don't see I'm not a member of the N R A although my father is But I guess I believe I think the N R A has gone overboard the wrong way You know they're sitting there on number ten they're saying absolutely no gun control we don't even want to think about it and and I think that's a dumb situation Because there has got to be some kind of background check to see that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose you know if if you're going to hunt with it or if you're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week It's not a big deal for them to go If they're can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket you know they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of psychiatric record armed you know felony record any of that kind of stuff And it seems to me right now that there's not there's not that much of a check I I'm not really sure what Texas law I think there's a check for felonies on your record If the gun shop owner does it you know but Yeah if and if it's a private sale of course then there's nothing Uh-huh Yes But but maybe we'll prevent a few John Hinckley's You know I I that that's the kind of people like I say I don't think the guy who's going to rob a Seven Eleven is going to rob a Seven Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife baseball bat or you know whatever but you know Yeah And and the people who want it it's not that big a deal like I say to wait Yeah it makes you wonder what they need it for all of a sudden here Um Oh Yeah I I imagine his his opinion is a little bit towards the one there on the scale of one to ten he needs some more Gosh if I was a cop I would be Too many people have too many too much access and I guess I think the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is there should be some law against the types of gu- some of these Saturday night specials that these companies put out that are pie- they're are basically it says here buy me and go rob a seven eleven yes they that's really gotten bad Or your child accidently If your child is old enough there are a lot of kids who when they're ten look like they're twelve or fourteen or and and especially some of the minority children Whether you know a racist or not that's the truth And And if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands and a cop comes up You can't Jeez and you can't take the chances Because there's been kids that age who have killed people And you know you know there was a law in <> I think it's in Oregon where they've now made all toy guns they're making them neon colors You know like yeah and the kids don't care My kid didn't care He picks up a stick and goes bang It doesn't make any difference to him Yeah Yeah so you like to do I think they ought to do that with toy guns they ought to make them very reasonably do something outrageous to them You know so that they're not very distinguishable from a real gun That's kind of They encourage it Um Huh I don't know I That's kind of an odd thing I don't know I have a gun and uh my folks have always had I learned to shoot when I was real little I think that's a lot of it too is that people need to teach their kids what not to what to do and what not to do Because I started shooting my Dad started letting me shoot like a little air B B gun when I was probably five or six years old But you know it was this is how you hold it this is the only place that you do it which was you know out far and away and you don't ever touch it unless I'm here and you don't you don't point it at people and then they had then they went to the Texas Parks and Recreation I guess but anyway the s- hunter safety program that you have to do now I think it started in about nineteen seventy If you want if you want to go deer hunting and your birthday's after nineteen something fifty-five or something then you have to attend one of these hunter safety courses or you can't get a deer license And it and it it's basic stuff it's like it's don't you know when you're climbing over a barbed wire fence don't point lean your gun against it you know and then you crawl over it and shoot yourself And uh those things happen It it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people Yeah put the safety on the gun Don't assume always assume it's loaded That's that's got to be the most common thing that people Yeah It's oh it's empty it's empty Boom I took the clip out or whatever and I forgot about the one in the chamber Oh Oh yeah Does he got them locked up all the time too When he's Don't even think about it yeah Yeah Um Yeah if you make it where it's not something Curious not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared about If it if it's just one more piece of something but they but they've got to understand like you said never touch it Yeah Ours is a we have a shotgun and it's up in the closet and then the shells are in another part and it's something to think about and I got it because my husband used to travel and be out he was out of the country at one time for three months And I was like I live in a nice neighborhood but still and then I've got it so far sometimes I think I wonder if I I'm not about to load it because I you know I assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there and it's in a case and it's you know it's put up and it's away and all that but I don't want to take the chance and I think if somebody ever does break in it's going to take me a year to find the shells and then get it Yeah Right I know I I used to think about that it was a lot easier when I was when I was single it was one thing and when I was just married with no kids when it was just me it was an easy decision It was like you you come after me you're going to get it you know and now there's so many other things where are the kids what are they doing you know where is this person coming in from uh you've got and and if if you manage to get it out and then you know what how can you even afford to to think about what what you're going to do because you don't know where your kids are at the same time Ugh We feel if they make enough noise that Yeah It it we have two big dogs in the backyard and always kind of thought that too kind of an extra buffer Yeah Anything that the well any any advantage that they can take Unfortunately yeah Guess it makes it worth the dog food over the years Yeah I I think that's about all I can We we're in pretty good agreement actually on it It would be an interesting it would be even more interesting you you to be some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum Me too I'm glad to find there's another reasonable person in Garland Well it's been nice talking to you Bye-bye
