Hello Hi um this is Betty and I'm in Richardson Texas Oh okay well here we go I guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that are that did some stuff over in the Gulf Um Yeah uh no I haven't pushed one yet I just Okay we're just sort of getting acquainted here Um you know I I just wanted to see if you know you had an opinion about this or you know Um so if that's okay with you then I'll just press one Okay Well hi Good morning Um I think if if I start this I just wanted to say that um one of the things that I don't think we really understood about the the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are and they think differently and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours And and right now I I think that that's been proven in the fact that um they have just well anyway I just think that you know the United States policy over there I think we should just leave them alone I really do In in a major way because they just um that whole region over there I think needs to settle it's own differences within itself And that's the way the course that they should go you know we can maybe help them a little bit prompt them but I don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on The the thing with Israel and Palestine I believe that should be settled between them And also um you know the other thing is their idea our ide- idea of democracy has nothing to do with them tha- I'm talking about the whole middle ea- and and maybe this is too general but I just believe that um they do not look at democracy the same way we do They don't understand it as we don't understand the way they live And so you know trying to put like a square peg in a round hole is just you know i- I don't think that that's the way to go in this and um you know it it Oh well that's that's a couple thoughts on it I I guess you know I'd like you to maybe express something here Yeah That's yeah Well ye- well yeah um I I guess we could be a catalyst for their change I um the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there and I don't think we'd be talking about this you know the Israeli situation Palestinian situation um sort of came to a head um unless there had been a war that was one thing that came out of it good or bad I I don't judge any war as good or bad it's just a war And I don't see any winners or losers I just see dead bodies I'm sorry You know but um i- I I just think you know you're right and I think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along It's not going to be that we're going to uh you know sort of tell them to go to their room and that's going to solve the whole problem It's going to be them Yeah And you know It's Yeah that that's true too I um Oh well yeah they they understand violence They love violent leaders to you know look at you know the leader they had They they just adored him because he was so strict and cruel and you know for a while there he had them be- Well it has a lot to do with their religion I got to say that over there um and I know this only because from personal experience that I'm speaking of this because I I've you know traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where I've done that and one one of the kindest people I've ever met in my whole life um is from that area of the country and he is just overly he he is abounding in kindness let's say And his wife is so godly every thought they have a totally different life than we have You know and when you add the um commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them And they have very basic life um well it's just a very basic life and they just really believe in Allah or God or whatever And it's you know everything is to the glory of Allah and and you know and it it's almost like Yeah well that's see using that yeah And it's always been military and it's always been and that's that's always been the way of the world Don't you think Yeah So it's really hard when you see the leaders compared to the people Yeah yeah Right and surrendering that was Yeah it just really comes down to people are people you know you have to have some compassion some humanness Doesn't matter where the boundaries are Um you know there are political boundaries and those are man made boundaries but you know for heaven sakes that's something that's been going on for ages Yeah that's true
