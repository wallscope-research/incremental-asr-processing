Well do you think uh I wonder the assumption is that it is a problem uh and I've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem though I have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem and uh but it's not clear to me that it is Um it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions But if those who don't vote if you made them vote and it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way you know in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote it's not clear to me that it is really a problem um I I assume that those who don't vote if you look at the break down of those who don't vote they tend to be you know poor blacks for example vote very little and things like that and I assume that they would vote differently if they were voting than your average voter But I don't know if that's the case In fact I've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't Uh I guess not I'm I I vote religiously I really do Um I guess I guess I'm a fan of democracy and uh wish I could vote on more things frankly But it's funny because here in California things are getting uh increasingly democratically oriented in in the sense of people being able to vote for things we have these initiatives state initiatives now The first really popular you know wide spread one was uh Proposition Thirteen which was a uh tax revolt against property taxes Uh and you know now we're and that was whatever ten years ago and now we're up to Proposition a Hundred and fifty or something like that we've just there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were asked being asked to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals and you had to vote for you know yes or no on each of them and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them and it was incredibly complicated and difficult And a lot of people revolted against that they said we don't want to have to decide all these things you know that's that's that's why we hire people who uh you know to to make these decisions for us Yeah I do t- Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah I wouldn't mind having oh more votes than I get to have frankly Anyone who doesn't vote it's fine with me as long as I can have their vote That would make me happy though Maybe not in a in a deep philosophical sense but in a selfish sense it probably would I don't know it's interesting uh some countries voting is obligatory Uh it is in Australia for example Yeah yeah I don't know how I feel about that Well Australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the United States And it's not for me to say that they're not Um they they feel here you have the right to vote and they simply define it as a duty there You know we have just as we have a r- a duty to pay taxes you know is that democratic we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country we have the duty to pay taxes And in that country it's a duty to pay taxes and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent And it's not clear to me that that's so much less democratic Um I don't know but part of me rebels against that but then I'm an American Yeah And some people don't vote there is like three or four percent of Australians don't vote and I think they're el- eligible for a fine I don't know if they actually are fined or or what happens but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote Uh-huh Yeah I was sort of s- Well I that's how I feel if yo- if you vote and your guy looses well you leas- you least tried and you can say something but if you don't vote I sort of feel like part of me and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like well if you didn't vote you get what's coming to you you know And certainly that's true in the overall no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole I sort of feel that way When they especially when someone they they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for or something like that listen: two utts And you know I say well you know voting for the lesser of two evils is still important Yeah yeah you it's it's funny because technically you do you have the right to do a write in candidate But of course that's that's not really a vote Um Yes it rea- really doesn't and so it's it's a complicated situation but I would like to see I don't know I I I'm I'm thinking of actually moving to Australia and and perha- perhaps I'll call you back and let you know what how the Australian system works not because of the vo- + I'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting but just because of a job opportunity And uh I No I'm not And uh so I'm I'm really quite quite curious how that would work to have both you know and I believe in the in a certain uh Soviet bloc countries you are are obliged to vote too In fact it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for up until fairly recently and that's what I think of when I think of you're obliged to vote But when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country with its two party system um I don't know I kind of part of me is wary and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty um Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Well that's a thought or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have I don't know The right to write your Yeah that's see that's an example of a right not a not a actually that's considered a privilege not a right Yeah but technically people most people technically it's a privilege but most people think of it as a right in other words if the government denies you driving denies you a drivers license people get very upset But actually it's a privilege which is allowed to be revoked And fortunately voting isn't that Except well except if you're a felon if you're a felon it is taken away from you they will take away your right to vote under certain circumstances Um so gosh so we don't have a great solution yet do we But I I also I also I don't know if you've uh read any of the um oh what do they call those The uh the early republican uh republic documents uh when they were arguing through constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people Um oh Hamilt- I think it was Hamilton who wrote number ten or something where he was arguing for a republican not in the sense of the Republican party now versus a democratic uh government and arguing successfully why the United States should be a republic not a democracy Which indeed it really is a republic not a democracy Where he defines dep- democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues In other words you vote for representatives And the whole idea was um presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person and and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy Because just as you can have a tyranny of a single um you know bad ruler or something you can have a tyranny of the majority And uh he makes a very uh passionate good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process because anytime you have a majority um they can change the law in a democ- a fully democratic process and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case Um oh you know a candi- if there's some minority that people don't like because of you know racial hatred or something like that the majority can just simply vote again- vote against them And cases like that he argues need to be constrained and and actually I agree except that I don't trust the people who are appointed to vote Yeah well I feel that I feel that wa- Yeah well their job is to be reelected by in large and so they work on that job And there's also an antigovernment mood in the country you know where government is misspending your dollars and and they're all fools and you know throw throw the bastards out that kind of thing And there's a notion that somehow if someone isn't as much as a government person they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange because if I'm hiring a plumber I want a real plumber I want someone trained in
