Okay I can go ahead and start uh in Dallas there's definitely a crime problem I know it's you know worse in the larger cities Um it's kind of a concern for me in fact at the moment I'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment and uh it's I am single and female you definitely are going to worry about the location and uh you know accessibility of people to be able to break in I live on a third floor now but I you know I'm real concerned that I I don't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that and the um Some buildings do it depends on the location The area I live in right now is is real good as far as crime rate is concerned and we don't have anything at all no burglar alarms no guards Some some places do have guard gates that you have to get through or electronic access gates and things like that Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Um Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah yeah Uh-huh There's a lot of that going on in Dallas too Yeah it's really sad Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh I agree I think that people are getting off too easy They're getting they're getting paroled too easily They're just getting uh put on probation or something because the prisons don't have enough room so they get they get lighter sentences and some of those people they don't deserve to be let loose Oh yeah Oh my gosh Uh-huh Uh that's terrible Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Right it's a little more understandable under the circumstances I guess Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right we have enough enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is So let let their country take care of it We don't have I guess too much trouble in Dallas with well I guess I guess we do have a lot of people come in from Mexico that cause problems but uh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh It was amazing I went to the Far East uh back in October to do some training for T I and I uh some of those countries were so safe it was unreal Singapore is very supposed to be very safe and in fact Tokyo and I thought Tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people but they at at the T I there I said is there any area I should avoid And the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl and said can you think of any place where Dana shouldn't go by herself or anything And she she thought for a few minutes and she said no And he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself She said no And they said it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway and somebody will turn it in and and nothing will be missing They said they can just about guarantee that there that that would happen if you did that I thought boy in America if you left a purse on a subway you would never see it again Yeah that's true that's true But I was thinking boy in Dallas if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night I'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out I couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place They said the apparently the crime is just uh I'm not sure what it is there Now I know what it is in Singapore is they have the death penalty and they really enforce it like for drugs for drugs they they enforce the death penalty for that Uh they're just very very tough and I guess maybe that's the way Tokyo is too or Japan is too They're just very tough on criminals Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh oh yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right and if they're overcrowded well you know they shouldn't have gotten theirself there in the first place Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah I agree because it's not fair to those of us that that deserve a safe you know life to have to Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Right not much Yeah huh-uh and especially not in some of these big cities like in Dallas they've had they're up in the top top five I think of cities that are getting policeman killed on on in the line of duty and that's really sad Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh
