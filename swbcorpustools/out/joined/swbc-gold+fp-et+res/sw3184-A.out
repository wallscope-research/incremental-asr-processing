Well basically uh did you want to go first then Okay right Uh-huh Sure uh-huh Yeah I think as far as like our home it's uh in a small residential area We're out of the cities quite a ways so it's kind of more of a country setting and uh it's just a typical uh three bedroom type of home It's it's nothing you know elaborate where it has uh this or this or you know It's it's just a typical home with uh three bedrooms uh two story type home Uh and I think as far as if it's for put it into standards of uh what other homes are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are Uh there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes and yet there's where we can view the river from that distance there's still homes within our area that are you know pretty typical of what our home is so it's uh pretty much that uh type of uh home so Uh Uh-huh oh really Sure Uh-huh Yeah Oh yeah yeah Yeah Uh-huh So it's the rambler style Uh-huh Yeah yeah It's kind of like what ours is Uh one of our bedrooms is really small and we've made that into a den because we only have one child so that was our best way of going with uh the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller It seems like they get incredibly small Uh but uh anyway but okay So that sounds great and uh I don't know if we need to talk any more or whatever The T I Uh yes uh about three times before I'm fairly new to it but it seems to be going okay No huh-uh No I'm out of state I'm in Wisconsin so Yeah yeah So it's Uh other than that sure yeah Is this your first time Uh-huh I'm always the one that initiates the calls because I kind of like it because it's like I can get it done with I don't have to wait until somebody calls me even though I have a feeling what's going to happen is I'll probably get tons of calls you know so sooner or later Uh- Uh-huh Yeah yeah Yeah sure Yeah Okay well you take it easy Gail Bye now
