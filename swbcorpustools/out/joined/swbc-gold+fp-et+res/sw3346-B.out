Well um I I just think the way that things are going that um it would be good for young people to go ahead and have um dedicate themselves to at least something I know like the Mormon religion you know they require two years of service uh missionary service right the boys yeah and um so but I think it would be good for all young people you know to be able to to do something like that um so that um you know I don't know I just feel it would be good for them to do that Yeah Uh-huh Oh sure Oh yeah and and even even in our home towns there's a lot of um public service things that they could do uh you know drug rehabilitation and and alcohol and and just uh helping old people and um uh you know helping cripple just helping somebody else and I think that art of giving is something that um we don't have very much any more Oh I think they just gave it a title but is this not something that's um in legislation or in work some yeah no no it's not it's just a just a topic I think so too I think so too Um because there's so many um kids who have uh you know so much money and so much free time and uh nothing to do um and nothing to give their time to Um they don't even have a direction to give their their time to so I think it would be really good for people to um to be able to give their time in in uh some kind of public service uh even in our government you know as uh aids to uh you know Congress uh people so um yeah it would be it'd be really good I think Uh-huh Right Oh yeah oh yeah I agree with you This is something that um like you say is it's character building um you know learning how to to give to others and being less selfish and Uh-huh Right Uh-huh uh-huh yeah Oh I agree with you I agree with you and I think uh young people are so um uh focused just on themselves and their activities and whose going out with whom et cetera that uh you know to get a taste of what the real world is actually about doing that public service would be great Yeah Right Uh-huh Oh yeah I would think so like right after um high school you know even if it was the the their um that summer right after high school you know three months Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Right right You know something that out that was outside of uh outside of school yeah but yeah you know right right after you graduate from um high school because a lot of people are just um uh Well gee whiz what do I do now if they're not focused on going to college and uh you know having that that uh gung ho plan uh that's you know setting their life goals Uh-huh Uh-huh yeah so to me see that would be the the uh the greatest time for um you know teenagers to to do that would be right after they graduated from high school But as for its being required you know we're just not we're not based on on that uh type of a system Um Uh-huh Right Oh right Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah yeah so um yeah it'd be good but like I said requiring it would be uh
