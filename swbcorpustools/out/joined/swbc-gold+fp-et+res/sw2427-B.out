Well I do it all Uh yes I I try to grow uh uh a vegetable garden and Yeah I have two plots one's ten by ten and one's like fifteen by four It's a long skinny one and Oh I see Yeah I see Right Right Yeah it's nice to get out in the open air And especially when the weather's not too hot or not raining or whatever but uh sometimes I I sometimes I wish I had more space you know I grow a lot of things a lot of food And sometimes I I want to plant something there's not enough room to plant Some of those things like uh you know the things that vine like uh cucumbers or uh squash or something like that Plant one of those and it takes up your whole space Yeah Yeah They they just run all over the place don't they Right Right The basics Right Yeah That's what we do too Right Peas I I got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago The first one they started them indoors this time I read it And so I Yeah I uh I guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that But uh sure is a heck of a lot of work Because you got to watch them every day and keep them watered and I I don't think I'll do it again Oh yeah Yeah I enjoy it I come home from work and and I usually say hello to wife and kids and then go out and fiddle you know just walk around the yard and inspect it and the kids want to swing and I push them on swing And I wal- I mow my own lawn And I do I don't have a sprinkler system I I don't enjoy watering Especially Oh how Oh Yeah you can have it come on just early in the morning And and off by the you know by the time you're up and about Yeah I I usually get it started for my wife and I and she moves it around ever other day Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Sometimes I wish I could get one of these uh chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that one step out of But uh they want too much money Yeah Right Right But it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself Right and the weed come up and all of a sudden you've got to do something else Yeah Well if you enjoy it too you know you you can get out in the morning when before it gets hot and and do it and stuff when you only have to Right When the days start getting a little longer you know you can I can start doing it in the evening after work When they when they switch to switch when we get an hour more when they rollback an hour I don't know I really don't know It just seems like I here it on the news the day before And uh I I think it's coming up here soon Yeah Yeah Are you having any trouble with bugs in in your garden Uh-huh Right Right I I it seems like they come in spurts One year I didn't put anything on and I didn't have any problems Next year I was planting some broccoli and and some of those they're called cabbage cabbage loppers or whatever They were just covered with them I went up I didn't go out there for about three days you know because I and I went out there one day and the plant was noth- nothing left but a stem they devoured it that quickly And they they have a you a good appetite And they would you know I I picked off like twenty of them and Ye- yeah They got that uh what is that safer soap uh B T spray this year And I've been watching them every day and I've and I haven't seen any signs yet So if I see any signs I'm going to spray them and uh Right Well the good stuff Right Right Yeah my backyard is uh is sloping so I built a box up you know had to build the one the low side up And uh I had sandy loam hauled in I had a dump truck come and dump it On my driveway I guess that's what they do and then I had to wheel barrow it in But uh you know you can improve your own soil there but the Texas soil isn't the greatest gardening soil Right And you know if I I didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow you know what I mean Uh-huh Do you have do you have a rotor tiller Small enough you have a just do it by hand Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah I'd like to get one of these little small ones that you see in all these gardening magazines And it weighs twenty pounds or something like that My neighbor across the street has one He always uses it to dethatch his lawn I see him out there and I guess it has a thatcher attachment to it Yeah Yeah I have a friend who has one and and he lets me you know no problem borrowing if it's just a hassle when you know to go up and it's a fairly large one to heave it up into the back of the van bring it home and check it back and just grab it you know if I just go to my garage and grab it That would be nice Uh-huh What have you got growing right now Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Okay what kind what kind of onions do you grow Do you grow those those ten fifteen Y Oh they they are the best Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh those I see Yeah I uh those onions I think we we planted like twice as much this year because you know we got on- onions and they lasted from you know about when you harvest them about a month from now or so or six weeks from now until until like October and uh we really missed them when they were gone because the ones from the grocery store just can't compare She made these onion rings that were so good and and and uh you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in that it's an ingredient and and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better Right Right We froze a lot of peppers We let some turn red And some we do green and then my wife puts them on pizzas And and chops them up in recipes and things like that Oh yeah Put them in salad yeah You're you're making me hungry here Oh Yellow peppers huh Yeah Sounds like you have a real good garden Just let me see what I got I got the peas and I've got some broccoli uh onions some some radishes and uh uh beets Uh and I planted potatoes too Oh the potato They were they're delicious but they you don't get seem to get that much for the space they they do Some beet uh potatoes and I've got some tomatoes still growing in in containers I got to wait for a place to to to free up Uh our our kids love pickles and we all love pickles so we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year We've got some good um um Hybrid Burpee uh uh pickler cucumbers and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own and So because have you seen how much pickles cost in the store I know it I said why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers you know I guess But we're going to try that and see how that works An experiment I'd like to try you know just try something new every year that I haven't tried before and Well
