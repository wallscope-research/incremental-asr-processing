Okay Thanks Well uh yeah we we do Um we've been married for twenty-three years and we have uh three teenage daughters and you know they're very expensive So uh uh we yeah we have somewhat of uh a system Uh it's it's kind of uh you know it's kind of hard to explain We've actually gone uh just recently to you know having having two checking accounts We always had just one And now we are having two Uh it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal So I have to be That's that's kind of the way I feel about it Yes Do you have a two income family or one income Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Yeah So your wife Yes It that what her is her career uh related to to finance or accounting Oh Uh-huh Yeah so that's sort of related to her field a little bit Yeah Yeah It's just taking it out right Right Yeah Yeah We do the same thing Yeah if you have something to take it out That's exactly what we've always done and we've had uh they've always had uh where they match your funds you know sometimes if you if you save so much then they will match it Uh that you know we've done that too But my husband works for an insurance company and he he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years I guess But he was with another company before that but we have we have I I work also but I only have a part time job and I get paid very little but uh you know I try to use that money for food mo- Jim gives me a certain amount money You know we just transfer it into my account and then I use that for food household expenses and then I add my own check to that and then with that I try and handle you know some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that but the expenses that we need and have around the house So Yeah Yeah we well Jim has Jim has a budget I mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down Uh you know I am given so much mon- money a month so I am suppose to kind of get the food out of that So I try not to you know we don't you know I don't ask for more I just try and make it on that Because I think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have and uh you can you can really waste a lot of money that way So uh well how long have you been married Oh yeah So you're just really getting started So do you have a family too Oh yeah Yeah She hasn't effected your budget yet really No Not like she will later on You will see that all of a sudden you're paying you're trying to decide whether you are going to do you know soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do and then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and plan some more and uh but I think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget and then as the girls got older I think we we did more and more of that You know more budgeting as as they got older Uh but uh but what do you do Do you Oh okay Oh Well good Good Well we just have you know we have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta I guess we're not suppose to talk about those things I'd better get back to the subject But uh budgeting I found you know I feel a lot better You know we use to work out of one check book and it would be very hard for me because I wouldn't have I wouldn't have any idea how much money I was spending in one month Now I have know exactly what I'm spending and it's so much easier
