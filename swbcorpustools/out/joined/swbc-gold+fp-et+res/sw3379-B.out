Do you know I don't know what to think I I uh the person I am I want to believe that it's an honest effort I want to believe that that they really are trying to change That that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society and I I want to believe it's all okay But then there's that side of me that says yeah but they've put on faces before And never to this extent though you know so so it's like there is a struggle within me going do do I be open-minded and give them the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality You know I I trust people I'll do that Or do I keep on going well we'll wait and see Yeah that's it's not just a mere- or uh western society telling you i- it's it doesn't work You know they've always said you know the the Soviet people were united we believe this and maybe they are seeing that no no hey we don't believe this you know But it's still you know I guess I keep that one part of me that's like well I don't know I want to trust them and I it's like I can't and maybe it's because you know we've had our own propaganda over the years I don't know And they probably do the same things You think the C I A doesn't spy I'm sure they do Now the difference is we don't I I don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe You know I think to that extent we don't go as far but I'm sure they lie You know So That's all right I hope you get better Yeah <> Yeah Yeah That's true And I'm not against them being concerned but I feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own You know you know any any country that wants to be democratic I'm all for helping them you know because I I understand that you know you are looking at the United States as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government But at the same time I I agree I don't think we can do it and and just you know turn our backs or or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here Yeah we we we believe in what he's doing abroad but but like you said there's issues here too And but I I am encouraged by what is happening in the Soviet Union I'm encouraged by what's happened in you know the the iron curtain countries you know in in that block and and I think it's moved in the right direction I I think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight You know it's not going to It didn't happen here overnight and it didn't happen here without a struggle You know And I I think sometimes we forget that But I I I I have to say yes I'm you know I'm encouraged by the way it's going Uh uh
