What are your favorite programs Oh how funny I've seen the sign that goes to there I've well I think I've seen it in the distance But I have not even seen it And I have not seen the program So And and uh I know when we went to London it was really funny Uh people recognized Dallas Texas by the the Texas uh the the cowboys and by that program And that's that's the two things they associate with Dallas Texas So I and I they asked me uh several times several times they ask me why are there two bridges And I didn't know what they were talking about It took me a long time they're talking about the viaducts Is that that is right isn't it Because they ask me why are there two bridges going into Dallas Darned if I know I was blank looking you know I felt really dumb Well there's water in the Trinity I thought it was to going to Oak Cliff over the Trinity Oh do they Uh Oh I see Uh-huh I think that is just a hoot That's one of those few that I do watch when the television is on My husband likes to watch T V It's on I usually read and watch T V And usually I can handle both at the same time you know slash error Because I am pretty sure where the T V plot's going slash segmentation error should be independent slash unit But that's one of the few that I just actually watch Because it's funny I really enjoy that one Now we watch a lot of those Uh and the ones that sometimes will hook me to put down my book will be the one there was one uh recently about the Gettysburg Address And they wrapped a fictional story around it And I thought that was well done And and it it caught my attention I wound up watching the whole thing Uh I guess the awards ceremonies and there seems to be dozens of them per year Maybe I've spent two minutes watching to see what they on and if they make a fool of themselves or not But they could take that whole collection and it would disappear and I'd never miss it for a minute slash error Especially the beauty pageants slash problem I I particularly take issue with those I I really dislike those You know my husband used to just be riveted to the Dallas Cowboys And now we're out running around and if they're if they're playing he'll turn it on while we're in the car to see what the score is and he'll listen But even I've said hey look you're fascinated with this you sit and listen to the Cowboys Let me run in here and I'll do some things and I'll come back and you don't have to miss he'll say na na na And he doesn't he doesn't watch it He list- like I say if it's convenient he'll listen to it But he just doesn't watch them on T V like he used to Uh Oh those people Yeah Oh how neat Well I actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans And I I I make the trip and did the whole New Orleans before the game and the game and everything/ and uh that was that was a lot of fun But I don't know I haven't been as I'll tell you what I love to watch And this is not this is rarely on television But what is a lot of fun to go attend is this arena football Yeah I like it so much better than straight football It it doesn't it has a lot of different rules The field is half the size and there's no they can't call time and things like that It moves a lot faster Uh again I think it may be on cable more than anything else We don't have cable Well Oh They're everywhere they're on every corner Everything you've ever wanted to see Well and I like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that Or it becomes snack time for various reasons You can put you know the only thing this DANCE WITH WOLVES I want to see it in a theater Because I understand that that your you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't That's what I hear too Well my husband smokes He's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes And you can't smoke in movie theaters And that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies But I haven't really cared up until this point But I we are this weekend going to go see DANCE WITH WOLVES It's that's it We will do it So Yeah finally Well I tend my job tends to be very demanding And to sit down and to mindlessly either read or just mindlessly stare in absolute comfort isn't as bad as it used to
