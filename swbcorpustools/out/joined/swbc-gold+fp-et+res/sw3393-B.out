So what do you guys having up there I haven't been up there since oh Lord forty-eight I guess Well no it wasn't forty-eight it was it was uh let's see yeah it was forty-eight I was in the Air Force We did an air show out at uh out at uh Boone Greene out at uh Andrews yeah So what's it been like up there Uh-huh Yeah Uh like September was hot and dry October Really Huh It really has been strange here this year this whole ye- course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one But uh we had uh you know all these we have all these uh somebody said you know you're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict Texas weather but Well always they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever and we had all this rain and it really is not a bad summer at all really cool But all of a sudden in in uh in October uh September October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time And uh then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping just pouring down you know There were flash floods everywhere that kind of deal and then uh into of November the first like the second week uh you know the first week actually we had we had a freeze and the average you know the average uh first frost is like the fifteenth of November here but usually it's not until later It's really strange Yeah Is it is it is it flooding anywhere It's just kind of uh clou- we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here uh which will be you know a little bit more typical uh autumn weather But really it's strange We haven't really had an autumn It's like we went into winter you know the poor trees said what Yeah uh it's Yeah there you you know usually there's uh I have a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas and you know all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine you know it's that same trees pines and and hard woods you know hickories and oaks and stuff and uh I was up there last weekend and there are trees that that still have their leaves on and they're green but they're dead You know the the freeze just got them They they weren't ready for it at all apparently and and we haven't had a typical fall at all Not much color you know changes have occurred at all Really weird this year I'm not sure what that what that means So you you all actually had some color huh It kind of crept in and Yeah it's usually beautiful up there isn't it Gorgeous That's you know I think you could drive along in Maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the and the pines and what not and you could you know you could be driving along in East Texas and looks just the same It's almost you know identical kind of country Beautiful Yeah Oh Yeah I was up I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend so Little little oak tree that was dead and cut it up and split it Well Uh it there's some trees like the oaks like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy There's nothing bothers them Their leaves are still green and some of the other oaks There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves Um what I notice mostly is the red maples that the leaves are just dead the dogwoods still look still look you know they got uh bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit but they still look pretty good It just depends on the on the uh on the tree
