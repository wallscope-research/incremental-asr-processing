Well I think they're they're having a lot of trouble right now I know my son goes to a private school but uh I think they're big city public schools by definition are having a a tough time right now just from uh probably from budget cuts and and everything else going on Well I had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school so he's he has been going to private since kindergarten So Oh he's loved it He is a senior in high school this year so he's Yeah he's done it the whole twelve and uh so many years and it's been uh it's been really good for him Uh overall on campus about twelve hundred but in the upper school upper four grades uh about four hundred and something so it's maybe a hundred per grade Yeah it really is Yeah that was we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture and he's done he's done really well and just he was just ahead at an early age and I didn't feel like uh in what was available particularly in the first three grades and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program And I just didn't think that was going get it I thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead uh every day But yet still be with his peers age wise You're just getting started Yeah I know That's a big problem We wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school Wouldn't have thought of it and and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe and Yeah but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for for elders and adults and particularly in in responsible positions have not uh I don't think have had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands I guess I Well the world changes so obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be they're exposed to a whole lot more things They have a whole lot more uh variety of things they they're that they see and do at an earlier age so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time but but still I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to to teach uh basic values and basic uh respectful of uhness of authority And I just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore uh Yeah had to wear dresses didn't you And when it was skirts it was like get down on the floor and we hold the ruler up here and it's no more than so many inches above the knee Because it was mini skirt time back there at one time Yeah I think that probably does have have something to do with it and it's also No they do not do uniforms although one where he was between like second and eighth grade did
