Okay you ready That's it What what kind do you subscribe to or do you I uh take a computer magazine And uh also uh BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS And my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside And the cardboard pages Well that's true I uh I like it when they have short stories Like REDBOOK used to always have a good short story in it And I haven't bought a REDBOOK in a while so I guess I I really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore Yeah I think it is Surely slash error; one utt with utt4 it's an institution surely it would have to be But Right Mine too This was it my last chance Well I I I went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that uh to uh ENTERTAINMENT And I was real disappointed with it I I don't know it just not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into It's little short articles more than anything else And that's one thing I don't like about PEOPLE Uh it 's just you know doesn't seem to have enough story to it If you've only got a short time to read No that's true Uh no not really not the one I take now It's a it's a magazine and it goes into all the movies previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes And uh I'm a real movie buff so that's why I thought I might be interested in it but it just hasn't been what I thought it would be And uh my mother has subscribed to is the reason I get uh the HOME JOURNAL and the uh computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me Otherwise if if I really want to take the time to read a magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf I'll pick it up then Rather than having them delivered and think oh I really need to read this Yeah Well I I do like recipes and crafts That's true Do you uh
