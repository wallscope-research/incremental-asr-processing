Uh Oh God no Uh no I'm not I haven't been I grew up in Dallas but I'm still not a Cowboys' man I like Philadelphia Eagles Yeah That's my favorite team so Uh now that Randall's coming back next season I hope they'll be do a little bit better They didn't do too bad last season But I hope they can do better How about yourself Uh-huh Oh tha- Yeah That's another one of my favorites They're not they're not my favorite totally But I do like them I like yeah Seahawks are good They now that Steve Largent is gone I kind of lose a little bit for them but you know he Really Huh Yeah That's kind of that's kind of strange It's too much running for me in in college football I like I like the pros They do you know it's more high tech more you know players are apt to act a little bit different when they when their jobs and their when it's a job and not just you know when you're getting paid millions to do it you ac- I think they take it to another level But I can see it's more you know grunted out run the ball type College football is a little bit different but Who- whose that Notre Dame N- Nebraska Yeah there's a running team Yeah That that that's boring for me I I'll take the passing teams any day But Yeah It's just it's four yards three yards eight yards tackle That's you know it gets kind of monotonous After awhile I I prefer forty a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just just to juice it up a little bit and but Yeah It's high dollar You know it's all it's all money now Even college is all can we get on T V so That's that's Right Yeah Uh not really I I don't think anything will ever take over the N F L I think it's basically you know it's it's an institution It's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball It's just I just you know it it it can be it can take over part of it But it's never going to be the next Yeah it's going to take a little bit Some people are going to watch it but it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday afternoon or anything you know It's just it's never going to reach that that standard but Yeah yeah It's kind of it's kind of strange Uh I guess we're the only ones who take it that far Everybody else still nuts over soccer but Yeah Yeah or Australian rules football That's Yeah That's some brutal stuff there That's that's worse than football as far as violence I think Golly Those guys kill each other out there Rugby is something else Yeah That's just wild That's why it's a go- a big college thing Rugby is definitely big in college because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do So yeah I could see the feel for that But it's it's pretty it's fun to play I'll give it that It is fun to play If you don't value your listen--missing a word very much But you know I don't think rugby will ever be professional but it it's it's No You can't stay healthy and do that That's a rough game But uh I don't know I don't know how my Eagles are going to do this year So you the the Seahawks are an up and down kind of team Yeah My my it's kind of odd My roommate that I live with here he's uh he's lived in Pennock Minnesota two utts Do you know where that is It it's a small town It's about two hours it's in like central Minnesota It's a couple of hours uh west of Minneapolis But uh You just live there now Uh-huh Well he's Live in Florida Like the Seahawks Hey I I I've only been to Philadelphia twice and I you know I I still like Really really Yeah but
