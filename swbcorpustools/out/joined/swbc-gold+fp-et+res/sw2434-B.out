Uh well what would you say your opinion is on gun control Ye- Well I think uh down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns And I think they need that Uh and I do have a I have a pistol It's a little twenty-two and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun An- you know I do like to have my guns Uh I don't know if I'll ever use it you know And like you my bullets to my little pistol's probably uh about three years old Uh my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two But uh I like to have them where handy I've never heard of anything like that That would be nice But a- you know the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other Yeah I know I I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in uh Tennessee And uh they had a waiting period and uh we bought it there And About nine days No No Th- somebody wants to do that I I at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does No a shotgun's got too much of a spread Or at least ours does Uh it's you know you have a little uh thing on the bo- bottom of th- on top of the barrel where you you turn it you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get And the spread changes Yeah Yeah My husband had a uh a police gun at one time And I shot that thing one time Almost knocked me down And it just a li- I don- I forget I think it was a three fifty-seven I'm not sure He belonged to one awhile back Uh since we moved we've only been here in Texas for about a year and uh we can't even find a place to shoot Just for target practice I'd love to get used to that shotgun We traded his pistol for that shotgun Yeah Well that's what my husband when he was in that gun club where he was doing that <> It you know he went mostly just to uh shoot at paper targets Uh but you know they used speed and accuracy and all that That's a good I've never thought of that That's a good point Yeah That's and <> yeah It well we uh we was living on a navy base down in Memphis and uh this one guy decided to play uh lonesome cowboy or something And he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot Well he went tumbling down the steps along with uh shooting his foot almost off He broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things I'm sure being Mister Cowboy I can't remember what the na- the term was going around It was about four or five years ago But Now I guess that would be a good idea Uh that's a hard one because we did that But uh I think there ought to be some rule against it I'll uh you know the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something the cops are going to come to you Uh I have no idea I've only had one gun and I've kept it you know the one gun that was in my name Yeah I- I don't think you have to register a shotgun Well see uh my husband has a thing If they go to uh regulating uh all right uh banning guns Pri- pri- pri- private cit- citizens this my kid is jumping on me I can't hardly talk My husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns Yeah Yeah And everything about you Uh I bu- bu- you know they know so how much money you make a week to uh probably your uh my kid is banging I was seeing what they was banging on Uh I've lost my train of thought I'm sorry Oh the Soc- Yeah They they probably know everything from half the time wh- ho- what time you go to the bathroom No that's that's a little bit extreme But they could know anything and everything about you And uh I'd like to have my gun If they go to banding banning them I'd lose my gun but we wouldn't lose our pis- our uh shotgun And uh we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about But I don't I don't uh No Yeah W- Yeah Well you can look in the uh the we got a thing down here called A SHOPPER It's a a ho- it's a it's a bargain thing Uh you go and ever- you know always see guns in there Five to seven guns a day It comes out every Tuesday No None whatsoever You call we sold a refrigerator through it and it took us all of twelve hours Yeah You know And I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun Yeah Well I agree with you there They do have too much control over us already Uh we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have Yeah I guess so I don't know They're
