Okay I guess tonight's subject is uh woodworking Do you uh Well k- kind of mainly the woodworking I've done lately is uh made like uh for example a little nativity scene Uh not the uh the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable put some shelves in and and some odd stuff around the house and so I I enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking and I do it out of hobby more than uh you know something I have to do How about yourself Uh-huh Well I'll have to come and see them That sounds like a good idea I you know and that's that is right it is out of necessity because lot of the things that uh well we can't be able to afford but also I I sometimes think that uh I enjoy doing that and I like to get out and and uh to work with my hands and uh sounds like you got some real nice tools too Do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh a entertainment type center Oh Right Right right Right yes I yeah I'm aware of that And also with a router you can uh make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge And Uh And uh casings and so forth that are that are real nice so that's that's good That's good Yeah Oh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldn't be able to do that Uh but uh yeah a table saw does take a lot of time a lot of space and is a pretty big investment And Uh-huh Uh-huh No they don't have basements Well I'm from up north also and and uh no there's no t- basements down here and it's kind of uh hard to get uh shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that Yeah lot of the equipment too that I've I've used in the past uh I w- you know I've used in school and uh I would I don't know I'd I'd kind of like to to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say a table saw and some of those things that would make uh some pretty nice uh pieces of uh well wood for for different things for tables for for uh chairs for you know decks and so forth so I don't know I I just enjoy woodworking and I think the the main thing is like you say it's a it's a good out It's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day and it's a great stress stress reliever Yes I have in school I have and I've made uh uh different things uh la- uh tables for chairs and I've made uh bowls and uh and uh
