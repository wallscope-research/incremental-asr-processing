Oh yes yeah They just uh started it again too just late or within the past few years You know for quite some time just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty Uh yes Well they find it is more deterrent Well uh if you You know compare the figures I think that's where they're uh they're coming from The uh Oh there yes They are That was before the uh uh they adopted the death law again But uh I I myself am in favor of it uh particularly for uh well I think Texas has a good good law Uh crimes murders related with uh drugs or killing a policemen Uh-huh Uh-huh Well why stop at children Why not go to adults too Uh-huh Uh-huh Yep Well I don't either but uh uh but there is something to be said about <> or uh uh j- just for the sake of argument I'm taking the a con I'm I'm against it Uh you know yourself how many times have you heard where uh uh a citizen was wrongfully arrested and served time at a penitentiary uh just recently this uh black man served nine years was it for robbery Uh-huh That's it Uh-huh Well right now our laws are so liberal that uh even with the death penalty in effect I don't think that uh they're going to use it uh too frequently uh unfortunately I like you say yes let's have it put them all give them all a shot get rid of them Why should they be sit- sitting in uh prison getting their college degree Uh-huh Yes very true I uh I agree with you there Uh slash error Uh-huh Well I myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that Uh I it it's uh that's an awful lot to uh to expect of a person to uh to kill somebody is what it amounts to It true Very true But they they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason Yeah well uh slash error Uh-huh <> Yeah exactly Well anyhow I guess we both agree that that it is it should be in effect Oh that's true Well now any uh just believe in just about any state in the union uh uh a death uh uh yeah death verdict is an automatic uh appeal And uh uh yes I'm inclined to agree with you I think so there should be a limit as to the number of appeals Um um well n- Not just for dealing in drugs It uh There are certain circumstances and I don't remember what they are Uh yes Uh-huh Oh oh yes yes I I believe it's any capital crime related to drugs I think that's the way it's worded I do believe that's in Uh I wouldn't swear to it myself But I thought it I thought it was in effect Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh it does Uh I have four sons myself and the youngest is twenty-eight so they are all pretty well grown up and they all went through it you know going through high school and everything and knock wood that uh they have not well I won't say they didn't try it uh I wouldn't know but uh they I doubt very much that they're they're using it now In fact I'm sure they don't Huh Yes Uh-huh Yeah That's usually the way it is It it's just uh try it out with their peers And none of them even smoke They don't uh they never strangely enough uh their mother and I both smoked when they were growing up Now my my my wife my ex-wife she quit uh well when she was pregnant with the last one and she never started up again And I just quit oh about fourteen months and two weeks ago Yes it is I and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by Um Well Well when I was still smoking I I felt that way If I was in a public restaurant seated at table with uh non smokers I would try to pick a s- a a my seat where the smoke would blow away from them Or I'd hold the cigarette under the table And uh but uh now I'm on the shoe's on the other foot Uh I'm aware of other people smoking now Um Yes Uh-huh Uh uh-huh Well the there's a trick I use They used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment And every time I wanted one I have to go outside and just take one One at a time And uh that that 's gets to be uh a deterrent
