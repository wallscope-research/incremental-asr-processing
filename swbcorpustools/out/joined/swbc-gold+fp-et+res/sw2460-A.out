All right well I have a lot of different teams that I like to to keep in touch with of course Texas Rangers being one of them uh you know you can't live in Dallas without you know Well uh I originally came from Saint Louis so uh the Saint Louis Cardinals are one uh I moved to Kansas City see I have I have a tendency to a adopt teams when I wen- go to a tea- uh go to a town Yeah so uh I lived in Kansas City for a couple years and I adopted the Royals I lived in Houston for two and a half years so I adopted the uh uh the Houston Astros so you know I've got quite a few No I don't I don't get into that too much eve- every once in a while I will keep in in touch with maybe like who's in the top five of hitting or something like that but I don't get into you know how many errors somebody has or things like that Uh-huh Uh-huh I've heard of that one Well I didn't know that that's supposed to be a real good statistic uh Well that's true they don't have the offense to uh to get out or to have the the more runs so Uh-huh Huh Which I was kind of leaning toward anyway to tell you the truth I kind of think it was necessary I i- i- I don't I'm not a a big um pure power hitter anyway I don't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time uh I think that uh that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it but when you get two strikes on you you have a tend- you know you should you know shorten your swing a little bit you know if it's a perfect shot go for it but you know the strike outs were a big problem for him and uh plus supposedly what I heard he was not much of a team player anyway so Uh-huh Yeah well that's true Right Yeah well there's there's another point to that too They said the that um that he was horrible at uh at batting with with men on base Now having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you you know gives you run obviously But if you can't do it with men on base there's something definitely wrong um you know you you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs you know to to be able to uh score enough runs to be able to win in these uh in this day and age so I think the Royals will do okay They have they have several pitchers that had badly years last year and they are they're these uh cycle pitchers they they pitch one year bad one year good one beer bad one year good Saberhagen has won uh supposedly the Cy I think he won Cy year uh two out of three years and uh you know so he's very much due for a good year Well now see that's a good question I that's I don't know how Oakland's going to react to being uh swept in the World Series last year They could very easily uh take that as a challenge Which is the way most teams nat- you know naturally do Uh and and just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them so Uh-huh Oh yeah baseball is there is there life up there like football is down here I think I lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis yeah Yeah that's true too I think that's all that they have Uh-huh Um Yeah oh yeah I I definitely do in fact I've got family that still lives up there Um from what I hear from everybody up there they're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go But I've been following Spring training and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far That well it can be It it really kind of depends on on um what they were you know what they were looking for In other words if if in Spring cra- training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do um then it really doesn't give you any indication But if they were uh playing the people that they're going to play then that might be pretty good indication so you know it's it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just you know come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring crani- training and then gone on a you know fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season so Exactly yeah You can't Right th- I think the best thing that you can do is go with um the players that are that have the talent to do the best years And um that they hadn't had these uh gigantic uh career years yet and and just kind of assume that you know so- one of them is going to break through eventually so And I I think they said the Reds um this last year I'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years You know and and so they may be even be- better this year Uh that's a good question I the Rangers have a have a pitching problem and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question They're doing the right thing though uh they are going with their farm system They're letting their farm system uh build up and stuff like that and Uh-huh No Uh-huh Um that's probably true Well considering what I've seen in the last uh you know two seasons I'm beginning to agree with that yeah But you don't have to spend the big money as far as I'm concerned to uh to win You just have to spend it if it's necessary In other words if you've got a player on your team who's helping your team then keep him there Don't let him go away And I think that's really what's been hurting uh the uh Rangers Oh yeah they they spent more money last year than any other team in the in the league and they were you know toward the bottom of the league Uh so it's like I said spending money doesn't guarantee you uh winning a pennant It really doesn't so Uh you got me I you know I think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can't go and once you do that you lose everything  Uh-huh Uh-huh Right That that's the whole point There are so many games in in a year that they've got to have repeat customers They can't afford not to and you know that's one of the things that I think Saint Louis has done um  their you know their ticket prices are you know kin- I guess as high as anybody else's but what somehow or another they attract uh so many people from som- they're a it's a small market and yet they attract as many if not more than most uh uh most other cities so
