Hello My name is Nola I'm in Plano <> Texas Not too far away I've had some from Plano too Uh-huh Okay um let's see Social changes That sounds like not as recent social changes too like back to the sixties or fifties I guess Think we can handle that Okay uh shall I go ahead and push one Okay <> You want to go ahead and start Oh That involves a lot of different areas I think Yeah there is a a big difference in the uh economic um status of uh people although I think that has been true uh always Um <> perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was Uh I think uh m- <> in my situation I have three children and we're uh home schooling So education you know things that relate t- to education um are things that I think about a lot Um I think that and I think that involves social changes a lot Uh for instance I think the schools are having more and more problems because of uh things that are happening socially in the world around them and in in t- because of their parents and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather More not than are And children being put in day-care centers from very early and and I think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the day-care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes Because of the way children are being raised they're not learning the values they need to learn And they're not um th- they don't have the self-esteem that they need to have and they don't have the um a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and deal with the things in the world And uh I think we're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang gang things that are happening and and um Yeah Yeah Oh it's That's really sad I think that a lot of people and they think they have to but I I think that if they really tried they wouldn't have to And I I think that if they didn't that and it became more of the standard not to that uh I don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home You know And have a more solid uh foundation for the kids That's right It's already It already costs society much more because of it You know it trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those You wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them you know Um there's and I think uh a lot of it is selfishness People have become very selfish They don't want to stay home with the kids or something like that There are a lot of two parent um <> situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do you know Rather than that she has to have the money particularly Or maybe there's a small need for money so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too You know Home school Yeah No I I have uh one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler And one on the way Yes Yes And I think uh it's becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while I think Home schooling's always been around but uh I can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools Um and a lot of it is discipline problems A lot of it is and you can tell which kids have been in day-care centers It it's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things That um they've been raised in a day-care center Well I think it's going to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else The home is the base it's the basic unit And that's the where it all starts and if we don't start making changes in the homes and maybe part of that is educating parents better And educating uh you know I know they do do some they do have some classes in um high schools and things for kids to uh give them an idea of what <> family life is like and the uh you know and uh that kind of thing but uh
