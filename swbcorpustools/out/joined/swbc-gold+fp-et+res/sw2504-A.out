Okay I think it's somewhere really close to that cause I think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference And they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore Because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked you know And so they figure why go out and vote you know They're going to do what they want to do They're corrupt anyway And I think one of the good ways of solving that is to like everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party and uh you know like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something that's the only thing that I can figure out because I've heard so many people say well I'm not going on voting on that one you know I I'm going to go fishing today Or it won't make any difference if if I don't vote and I think it does We vote every time Right Right And ma- maybe let them have some mock uh you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start really young That's a real good idea Right Um God Right Yeah Well I don't know how it is up there but down here Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all I'm sure you heard about some of ours And uh people are just it's like they're turned off on voting And that's the reason I said maybe if you had something like a block party Okay we're going to have a block party Everybody's going to get together We're going to discuss the different issues and stuff and then we're going to go and vote you know We're going to go vote like maybe they could give something like uh the top neighborhood if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that you know it doesn't have to be it could be like a a sign that they would put down at the end of your block You know or anything like that but it it's really bad here to me it is It seems like people just don't care anymore They say huh well it don't make any difference you know One crook is as good as the other one And they don't bother to listen to what any of them have to say And uh I know my husband now we go vote every time I don't care how small the ballot is if there's one thing if there's one issue because the way I feel is if I don't vote then I don't have any reason to gripe Right And I hear so many people saying well I wish this would change I wish that and you know but they didn't go vote And uh maybe if they like you said if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all Then uh and the importance of it because okay if you don't vote for your friend over here well your friend's not going to have a chance He needs your vote just like he needs everybody elses you know Maybe if they were brought up that a way like you said it would Because I know here uh until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines and you voted for like cheerleaders and different things like that but they should start that a lot earlier Right Yeah Right Right Right Definitely You know a good i- idea for the young kids like that too is to have like a a mock one And okay this this candidate tells you some things that are going to happen and this candidate tells you some things Okay then this percentage of the voters the kids in that class they are not going to let them vote this time but they have to do whatever these people whichever one the other people elect do If they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them okay now you're not going to get to vote but you're going to have to do what that person says they would understand probably by the time they were in high school they'd be ready to vote Yeah Right Uh-huh Yeah I think that sounds great Well you know they'd have to start when they're real young you know it would have to be a child that is just coming into school Because well I'll tell you another thing too now Whenever the first time I voted I never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines now this sounds dumb but I did not know how to use those voting machines and nobody ever showed us or anything so I didn't vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question all the other kids laughed at them They thought that was funny Ah she don't even know how wah wah So there wasn't any way I was going to go in there and vote And it took me it took such courage you wouldn't believe to go vote the first time because I was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because I didn't know how to work the machines Now that's bad And I was out of school I was a married person And uh I didn't know how to work the machine you know And it really scared me really bad Because I thought all these people are going to laugh at me because I don't know how to work this machine Where if they'd if they'd had a class or something or just to a short time you know to said okay this is the way Right It's this is the way it's going to be And my son was exactly the same way that I was and I didn't realize it until uh his senior year I s- asked him something about well did you who did you vote for for uh cheerleader And he said oh I didn't go vote He said uh there's no way I'm getting in that machine Well then I realized it so when we went and voted the next time I asked the uh lady I said I want my son to come in with me and she said well uh why you know He'll have to come back out I said because I want him to know how to use one of these and I said I won't turn any of the buttons down but I want to show him how to use it so that he'll be able to vote And uh so he went in and now he's a registered voter But he would not vote before then And I think that's bad You know here I was And and even of course there's a lot of years between the two of us but even with that many years between
