Hi Well I mostly listen to popular music I uh listen to it all the time in in my car so I I tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because I don't like commercials But uh I find myself listening to popular music and uh quite honestly I I have some little children and I unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately but that's not by my choice How about you Lucky you Um um Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah How do you feel about rap music It seems to be so popular these days Uh-huh Right When it was really just starting Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Yeah you really It seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music A lot of times you'll hear songs that you know they're not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm And uh sounds it sounds so much different and yet I I have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music and uh she thinks its pretty funny how often I know all of the words to songs that she's listening to and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces That's right No Yeah I guess there was even a a bit of ruckus caused by the M C Hammer who's really you know seems to be the hot one of of today He used um WILD THING Do you remember that that song he used um I can't remember who the artist was on that Who Was it well ma- maybe it wasn't that one Because it was a living it was a living person that I'm I'm thinking of that um that said "You know hey that those are my words" And uh I guess that they because they hadn't originally gotten um permission from him to use it And he he since then has has amended that and paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on but Maybe so I I can't think Yeah Right They destroyed it Oh yeah I I remember seeing the video of it on M T V and I thought it was hideous It was ugh I didn't like that either I remember I saw him in a concert when I was I think it was in high school Uh-huh He was very good I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in uh Philadelphia It was in J F K Stadium if I can remember Hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like Um um Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh yeah No You can only laugh Right well they I guess our age is showing when we we think that Uh-huh Yeah Like Paul Simon Like Yeah Yeah What do you mean by world music Uh-huh Uh-huh Um Right No So then it becomes a kind of music of of it's own so to speak or uh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh The are they trying to We've talked our five minutes though I've been listening to that a lot lately Oh yeah
