Um a lot well the last movie I saw but it wasn't my choice was the NINJA TURTLE movie That's right Yeah but my preference is the one we saw before that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS That's an excellent movie Oh was that good I heard Oh okay Well that's good Yeah SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat Right Yeah it is Right And I do Really Oh I love them like that I'm not I I like all ranges of movies but I like that where they run tense I really enjoy they keep me guessing the whole time It's really it was really interesting Oh Yes the new one of course Oh <> Amarillo I didn't see the first one My husband said it was um about the same lines So yeah Right right And I was impressed with the fact that um it wasn't that childish You know what I mean It wasn't my daughter's five she understood everything She goes to almost all movies with us except you know R rated And she really enjoyed it but it was on a higher level you know where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did and I liked that Right That's right that's right It's pretty good But we take her to just about every movie and she uh she does really good We've taken her from real young and she does real good Like I said we don't take her to Rs So if and when we ever get a baby-sitter like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS we go see it Oh no no Yeah yeah <> Oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw <> Huh huh huh Good question good question We don't get to go that often but something on the tip of my tongue and I can't think of which one it was Uh Gosh I can't remember Uh-huh But that that sounds good Uh-huh Right Oh okay That's neat The part was hard to do that Right Yeah Right Right Uh-huh Yeah I like him Probably the last comedy we saw now that I think about it is HOME ALONE It was really cute Yeah Uh-huh uh-huh Yeah Right Maybe so maybe so Yeah I did too I'm looking forward to this summer uh NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF is coming out I do too they are just slapstick <> It you have to see those twice to catch everything Yeah yeah Yeah I do too I do too So I'm looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious as they all do Well we we try to go a couple times a month I guess to see a movie It it's just getting so expensive But normally we don't think about it until I know because we can go spend fifteen dollars just getting in the three of us Yeah I don't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both You know popcorn is not that expensive So they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke Yeah We just keep breeding them I guess so Now have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES I haven't seen we're waiting for the video No really Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh really Oh Uh-huh Right Everythin- yeah yeah Yeah oh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah You think my daughter would like it Oh okay She doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes See that's the one that is the honest to God the one reason I don't want to see the movie is because I love buffalos for some weird reason and I know they're fake Okay okay Oh that'll be good We really need some my husband keeps wanting to Yeah and I heard the video's even going to be longer They did a lot of stuff that they cut out Yeah that's true they said Yeah they said there's a lot that had been edited because of the length and that they wanted in so they're going to put it in the video And that way you can watch it at your leisure Yeah Yeah yeah True <> I know it <> Isn't that ridiculous We have cable which helps a lot Yeah we keep holding out you know
