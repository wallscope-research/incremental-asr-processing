Well credit cards I'll tell you what I I can't say a whole lot about credit cards because I uh tore mine up Yeah uh I got in some problems with uh financial problems because of credit cards so I uh basically just got rid of all of them I I have a a couple I have a uh gas card that I that I use just for gas and you know uh one that I use just for emergencies but Yeah I know it Uh-huh Oh is that right That's a that's a good policy Yeah Yeah uh sometimes I wish I had them but in most cases I'm glad I don't because I you know unfortunately I I I don't have the control you have I wish I did but but I don't Uh and it you know it I just don't want to get into that situation again so we'll Oh that's it See and that's even with my gas card you know I find that I'll go in to get some gas and I'll end up buying you know candy and drinks and you know sweets and whatever and then at the end of the month I you know I get a bill and I'm thinking what did I get that costs so much And Yeah that that's true but I can I can under- certainly understand where You know Oh yeah Isn't it that's unbelievable How let me ask you this How how old are you Thirty-three Okay You'll be thirty-three this year You want to be thirty-two as long as you can huh It's coming Yeah I I know what you mean about the interest rates It's uh it's unbelievable Uh-huh Oh jeez Yeah and then you bet That's uh yeah I in fact I've I've even uh heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less uh rates and have paid off their you know higher interest rate uh cards and just sent them back you know And I I guess there's some there's uh uh some negotiating there too because I heard uh on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is uh call you know if you've got a pretty good rating uh credit rating you can call your in- you know your your card wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my you know uh annual fees or I'll just go to somewhere else You know and if you've got if you've got a pretty good uh uh history with them they're more than willing to do that Yeah in fact that's that's what this guy you know he wrote a book on it and he says that's you know he's tried it sev- with several of his cards and he's just told them you know I I can get this card from this bank at this rate and yours is at you know eighteen or nineteen percent It does not make sense for me to do that and if you won't drop my rates I'll just go ahead and send you back your card and I'll go somewhere else and get it Uh-huh
