There we go Uh so uh what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary That week right Um Well uh I right now I'm in sort of a weird situation I'm a graduate student that uh I don't have that many benefits per se Uh sort of get Yeah yeah My wife has a real job and I can see from her angle Uh uh I think health insurance is real real important I've I've I've I've discovered even in my case it's sort of they're really uh a pain in the neck about it up here because the university makes me buy a small they they have a mandatory they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance they offer insurance to everyone but then the basics that are major medical they they force you to buy here Now I'm covered by my wife's anyway but I still pay them a hundred dollars a semester for uh mandatory So that's sort of annoying that I'm paying for something I'm not getting in that case I'd rather that that went to something else Right uh and and and it turns out that actually uh  the benefits they + you know that that hundred dollars sort of would would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and and use them and it turns out that I do think they're v- they're excellent physicians there So through my wife's H M O we've registered for them as our primary care physicians so we go there anyway so they're they're so if they were to bill which which I believe they don't but if they were to bill the H M O for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing But they're not thank God Uh but anyway uh otherwise I would imagine uh good vacation is is important although I don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job I don't you know Oh wow So that's really Yeah I don't you know I don't I know my wife uh I think she gets you know about two weeks a year I guess but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off They you know usually let her Yeah Oh really Just yeah Yeah That's well that's a that's reasonable I think Yeah Weigh all sorts of other things Yeah I think I was watching something the other day about that actually on uh a news special or something like that and they were saying how in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people you know don't get to they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that so Uh-huh Right Least off who decides Right Right You want to know that that that when you pick a doctor you know you you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about Yeah that that's the
