<> Well I haven't tried but this is I haven't called in a couple of days but education in public schools I have a son who's graduating uh in May and there's some interesting problems of of of how d- you how do you challenge the kids today And I have some real hang-ups I think that uh if your if your kid's not ambitious he can sure get lost Yes In North Garland he goes t- What school system are you familiar with Y- oh okay well I have a daughter that's in the in in the I B program at Garland In the are you familiar with the International Baccalaureate program Uh do your kids go to Garland High you said Oh okay Well there's a it's um she went from Austin Academy when it opened up over to uh to North Garland for ninth grade But at North Garland the the difficulty I see with the education system is that uh is that you can you can you can get some masses but unless if the kid's really dedicated it seems like they do all right But if if if your child is just pressing along uh I I'm firmly convinced that teachers aren't being paid enough Would you argue with that Well you know the the the thing that I don't see and maybe you would take issue with it is that if if we went to if there was an opportunity for teachers to teach year around Well would Well how do we accom- how do we get that Yeah Does it work well out there Well what about the what about the issue of air conditioning Isn't that a s- an area of concern in the cost of air conditioning Oh yeah Yeah Yeah it's it's less degree days you're right But I think I think Yeah W- well how do they do it Do they put uh long do they put two or three week breaks between Is that from from what you've seen is that the desirable way to do it Oh you said you had some people from California Oh I thought you Oh okay But you didn't go Well the the other issue has to that I hear that the local commentator I listen to some the idea that the numbers of administration and the fact that the principal do you see that the principals aren't really in charge Well I had heard that one of the comments when they when they brought it Um Then why the the one they brought in the new superintendent for Dallas schools the admini- um can't think of his name but the idea yeah that he had suggested that that maybe they could reduce the number of administrators and and some of the people who were administrators saying that that uh that's not what he was hired for But they resented the fact that he would try to save some costs there Um Well you know the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that it tak- that it took to contest the the football um issue Yeah but the I can't think of the name of the school that that uh but in any event they they they kept arguing Yeah And they went to court i- you know guess I I'm sympathetic with the kids but but how much money did that cost Dallas to to to fight that in court But just think of all the the all the lawyers you've kept employed see That's right and and all these other people are out running around I guess that's the only problem with jobs being relatively scarce so But you need to keep all these people employed right And and You mean you mean we need a little more of our tax money like maybe uh Yeah Oh that's Um that's interesting and how many administrators is that going to take Yeah Yeah well that's that's part of where my son is um would like to go to Rice but I don't think he's well the the difficulty is is is the people that get in are are are overachievers And he's not an overachiever But the same time everybody can't go but it the question of of you know of how far should you take a kid in the motivation I'm not sure I think maybe there's too much responsibility put on the teachers to motivate these kids I had a a friend that was administrator in Richardson said if the parents read books then the kids probably would read books But that a lot of the schools I would think the kids you're talking to question of of how much reading do those kids' parents do Well Well but that's the point as I would say uh and that is that's what makes there's a lot of problems But anyway um I'm trying to think how much longer I had a conversation week or so ago and we got carried away and they cut it beeps in at ten minutes So So anyway Huh Well see that's in the Garland schools the numbers they I don't think they have to do that because most everybody passes Well opportunity right If you get graded on percent improvement But see that Yeah And unfortunately the uh that's that's tough that's a real challenge though But uh Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Well yeah you know our s- son had that he was had an attention deficit disorder and they were keeping him from recess and in reality that's uh that's one of those really tough situations I think the kids need some time to play But people like if more people like you though that understand the problems get in and and change some education so Uh I got some background noise there but I guess <>
