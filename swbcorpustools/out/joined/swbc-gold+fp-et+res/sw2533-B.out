Well I'm only a little bit familiar with the Red Sox because I lived up in Boston for a while and um and that's after that if you asked me that I wouldn't have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball Yeah but at the same time I don't know it's pretty far to throw that far I couldn't do it Right he's supposed to be able to do that Oh really I didn't know that Uh-huh Yeah and I've been watching uh my husband's French and so if I've been watching the French news when I watch it It's incentive speaking of Bush we're going to get a little off topic but speaking of Bush they that had a story where he went to visit some little uh elementary school students and stuff Did you see that where he the guy asked him for proof of who he was he said his I know and see a credit card It was so funny to see it was a really cute little kid too Well I can tell you that the Mets opened I think two days ago because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game and I couldn't tell you who pitched but they won the Mets won But yeah not my a lot sp by and then somebody else lost maybe it was the other New York team which is the Yankees but I don't even know if they're still New York Yankees or New Jersey Yeah Well but it the- then they can have them play against each other I think it's still the New York Yankees you know I thought they were moving to New Jersey This is how much I know about baseball Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh With baseball tickets Yeah Wow Because they're fancy seats and stuff I know I'm always scared of that whenever I go to a game I rarely go but we went last year because my brother my brother is impossible when um he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff and if there's a game on he's watching it that's all there is to it and he's like glued at the T V Oh I'm glad my husband's not like that either I'd kill him My brother's like that and um see he goes to a lot of games not a real lot but he tries to go then my father got us some tickets so my brother's wife and my husband and I went Last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because you know being a non-American you want to see what a baseball game is like And he describes it as you sit there in a crowd it was nice weather and stuff it wasn't a real problem but you sit there in a crowd and you're waiting and waiting and waiting and you eat these lousy the hot dogs um because we made him try a hot dog you know and um so you sit there and you wait for the longest time really bored and then all of a sudden something happens but you happen to look the other way during the time yeah and so you're basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen and when it happened he missed it and didn't understand it and it slash error Um he grew up out well he grew up in which is the sort of O strip east to west eastern part but that Yeah he's not that far he was sort of in between Strasbourg and Paris Oh is she still there Because Yeah Saint Claude yeah we used to that's one of the um entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city And it it it it sits right at the limit I exactly where she is But um we met in Paris Twelve children Oh my God the poor woman Were any of them twins You probably can't afford to eat if you have more than two of them Uh-huh Uh-huh But how do they afford to even have the kids uh we're expecting our first baby almost any day and slash error Uh-huh Wow Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I I don't know what Foley's is Uh-huh Yeah Yeah well that makes a really big difference But but still it's just as hard as having that but your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh I admire someone that can do that you know I really can
