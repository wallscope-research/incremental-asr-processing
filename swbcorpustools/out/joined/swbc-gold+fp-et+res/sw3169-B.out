Uh about the only memories that I have of boating uh my husband's family had a a motor boat uh when we got engaged and they took us out on the lake several times And uh I really did enjoy that I I don't know that I ever learned to drive it or anything but uh we did some water skiing of course and and uh driving around the lake in the boat and and just the basic safety rules and things I found real interesting Uh you know they they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever The the laws were there and if you didn't obey them uh you know there were a lot of accidents I guess But uh I found the motor boating was real fun Oh That sounds like a real challenge Uh-huh Well my son
