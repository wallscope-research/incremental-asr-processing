So what do you think about it How are we doing in recycling Are we Uh-huh Yeah I do a lot of work with the boy scouts and we try to do a lot but there's still a lot more we can do You know I don't recycle my newspapers myself but I noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a like a a clothes hamper kind of thing that you know you lay your string in then you put your papers in there tie them all up and bundle them up so I figured I might get me one of those because we don't always read the newspaper Sometimes it just sits around for a while and then we just chuck it Yeah Yeah Yeah see and Yeah see and here in Lubbock everything's so close I can imagine what it's like up there Yeah See I went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that I could put on the wall and then I put me a little five gallon bucket and it's just outside the garage door so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket Yeah I got one from Payless Cashways and it's actually metal it's not plastic I didn't want to buy a plastic one Yeah But Payless Cashways has them and they're metal and I don't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there but it was only like seven dollars not too bad Yeah Yeah I don't yeah I don't think it would crush steel cans it's pretty tough No you could probably just you know Yeah they won't yeah they won't take any lint free paper or see I work at T I We do a lot of recycling out there Now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard but that's just now come on board You know we've been throwing paper out there away for years and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out you know Yeah I'm sure they are T I is doing it pretty well nation-wide I'm sure Oh yeah Yeah I bought a I got one at work that I bought for one of the guys there at work it's his birthday we're pretty good friends and what it is is a recycled paper bag and it's just got Happy Birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside and it's just a paper bag you know and it's really cute But I think we're doing better and better all the time still don't No there's not going to be any room shortly I don't know what New York does about theirs I guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere Yeah so But I think we're getting better at it I think there's quite a bit more we could do But you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth Yeah Yeah it sure is Yeah yeah Well they'll get at it sooner I guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later You know they have We tried to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that I have and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans You know if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure they'll save them for us there's no problem there But what do you do with them in the meantime Now I don't want a can a garage full of cans You know No they're just not they're not prepared for it Yeah yeah they do You know the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get that's for sure So Yeah Yeah myself About the only thing I really recycle around here is aluminum cans So Well if we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way If everybody tries to do just a little bit and a little bit more then we'll get there Well thank you for talking to me Sure no problem All right Bye-bye
