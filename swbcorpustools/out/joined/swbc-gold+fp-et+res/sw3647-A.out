Brian in Plano Texas How are you doing today Great Nancy You're in Plano also huh Well good to hear I was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania Really All right Well good to hear good to hear Which one Oh yeah The Utah Jazz Yeah they're they're pretty good They've got some good good some good uh good players out there Well you ready for New Year's Eve Good Should we uh start this so we can What was your name again Nancy that's right and I'm Brian Just a moment Okay Nancy then I guess the today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary What uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as as crucial benefits Uh-huh Oh Uh-huh Right Uh-huh To to compensate for some of the benefits Oh Yes Well that that's an excellent so actually that is a benefit uh Yeah Right Right well I guess that's a good point uh I do belong to a a large corporation or my that where I'm currently employed and there's uh there's some different things uh one that you've already mentioned is is health insurance I think through our health insurance that I can get better rates as a through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because I had to do that at one time when I wasn't employed with a large corporation and that got to be somewhat expensive so I I think one of the benefits I I see is the uh is the group uh group discount Yes Yes and that's that's one thing I do have If I didn't have a family I don't think I would have as as a male or as a as an individual of in this stage of my life I don't think I would have insurance uh other I don't think I would go through that expense One other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job I really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where I could go and I could work uh nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours or I could do uh work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a you know three w- day weekend And make uh make my job flexible in that case Well basically yeah I had to do that uh the same uh for about every quarter of the year uh because I was in a in a position of management I had responsibilities over people that uh I needed to make my schedule uh so that if I was not there I would have coverage by some other management personnel so so I I think that uh that was a that was an excellent benefit that I really enjoyed and I don't c- have that in my current operation but uh you mentioned uh flexible work schedule and that's that's good And uh what other benefits do you think are important Yeah yeah that's true Well and that's an individual thing Yeah with uh with our current uh organization we do have a nice retirement package and also a a nice thing that that we have in our corporation is a uh is a profit sharing plan where we can uh participate in the the profits of the company If we're you know if we've been there a while and we're vested uh which means that you know we have a an interest uh in the company that we can uh get some of the benefits of the either the profit high times or or in a sense suffer during the low times and uh also uh in one of my wife's uh companies where she worked they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that that
