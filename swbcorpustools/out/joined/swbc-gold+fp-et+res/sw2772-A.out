All right Okay Oh Yeah Uh-huh Oh okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Well right now we're we're having the little bit of Spring that we have We don't have many seasons here It goes from Winter to Summer usually Spring usually consists of a lot of rain Especially thunderstorms We've got we had one of those blow through tonight And I think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days So It's gotten up to uh ninety a couple of times But basically it's been in the low seventies and eighties Yeah It's not really been too bad Usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier Yeah quite a bit Well the season is just about over for that uh in fact we drove down to Corpus last week and uh there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way drove through San Antonio and I spoke to somebody else this morning from San Antonio and were they had and we came back What day was that Sunday evening and they had a big rainstorm come through there part of the same thing we're getting now I guess Yeah That's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy Spring We had a pretty rainy Fall last year as well Um we've had a few down here but not anything like Kansas But this is the season for that They do they do pop up occasionally around here Yeah Yeah I'm from here originally so when it's July and August I'm pretty well used to the hundred degree temperatures The biggest problem with with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil It's that black clay soil You know it's not sandy like most of the state is so it doesn't absorb the water real well You know once it rains a little bit it's it's filled up and everything else just runs off you know Yeah Yeah We have it especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years And there's a section in South Dallas that's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain Really Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Uh-huh I guess I'd prefer that Yeah Uh-huh Yeah It's pretty dry We get some when it's this rainy but it's nothing like I guess San Antonio Summers it's nothing like Houston <> or East Texas is a little more humid Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference That's nice Well my wife's originally from Virginia and we lived there for about nine months and that was a real change for me Um parts do We we're over in the western edge in the mountains And they have of course some pretty severe storms Winter storms snow and that type of thing But they're so good about clearing the roads that you know it doesn't usually bother you very much Yeah Their Springs and Summers are pretty mild too It never gets real real hot Uh-huh Yeah Well as we were talking the weather came on and there's a flash flood watch and more rain for the next three or four days Yeah Maybe we can send you some I think that will do it Well I enjoyed talking with you Lisa Uh-huh You too Bye
