Well uh I am basically retired now I was a member I was in education and in administration so basically I wore dresses slash And uh heels and I was never one uh because my work often took me into court uh never was one that got uh accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work But that was just me I know many people are co- very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants Uh it I guess I was just old enough not to uh be very comfortable in it How about you Oh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yes And I think that does make a difference because when you do have to be in front of people uh I think you the the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and and uh more classical style of clothing What about the mini skirt We- Uh-huh Well there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts There are some that are really short and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person as well as the shape of the person's legs Now I also uh even though I retired from education I uh I do modeling and I teach at a modeling agency here And uh so when we are doing wardrobing and we have uh two two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job Uh even though I may have them from sixth grade on up through uh grandmothers in my class And uh whe- I always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad because maybe they those are not the clothes that are the most uh appealing to you or the most uh complimentary to you But uh the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want And and then uh then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy That's right Well I I uh I have to uh agree with that even when they was very very popular in the early sixties uh I uh uh again maybe because I was at the school there were still many teachers who wore mini skirts uh we had no regulation against it and a lot of the kids did of course and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers Because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts And so I think uh uh of course now I go the other extreme I do not like to see in the corporate areas uh all the women dressed like men with the suits and uh white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same Uh I don't like that I don't I think there should be individuality in dressing Yes Right Well I and I  don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to to look professional I think that you you make of that what you wish and you can go the opposite direction and uh over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which don't belong in the in at least in my opinion in the work place Uh but that that you can have a classical look without a lot of a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine Because that was one thing I always fought against I started out as a physical education teacher So I was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish uh and people would never ever guess that I was Phys Ed and um and that pleased me uh and so then I of course just continued what I considered the best style of clothing for me at work and uh and I find even even at home here now  I I  will wear blue jeans or I'll wear shorts and what have you uh and be very comfortable but when I go out somewhere then uh unless I have a pair of dress slacks I don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans I have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how And so uh uh I just feel that uh you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort But uh there are certain norms that companies should be able to uh put out as guidelines for their employees Right Yes Yes That's good Yeah uh-huh Yes Right Right right Yeah Yeah well I don't either Fortunately I don't have to work in those companies But uh I I uh did have a group come over from one of the banks over the children's hospital where I was volunteering and uh they were doing a presentation and every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly a like men and women They all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or sla- or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants need slash And one was a skirt and one was a pant sd And uh and I think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality That 's uh can stifle creativity So I guess so well it's been nice talking with you Uh-huh bye bye
