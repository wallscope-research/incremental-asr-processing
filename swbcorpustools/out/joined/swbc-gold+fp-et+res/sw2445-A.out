I don't know um do you do a lot of camping Yeah Oh so Yeah um up here some of the state parks are really nice and some of them aren't some of them are pretty rough Um yeah they they just have like outhouses they don't have like a shower room or anything yeah but some of them are really nice they have showers and full bathrooms um but I don't know I I've been camping a couple times but I'm not a real avid camper uh a lot of people I know are but um I don't I don't Yeah we went we went once to a lean-to and it um there wasn't any electricity on the camp site but it was all right we only spent two nights there I wouldn't want to spend more than two nights I wouldn't want to go for like a week but um two nights is good Um especially there was a little store close by so it was pretty nice Oh really Oh Um yeah up here you got to wait until Aug- August until the water warms up Well it's not that bad but it's still pretty chilly Um I don't know I was I have a tent and I fluff out in it in the backyard and stuff but this thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything and another thing is the thing seems to get it's dirty you know so you can't keep the dirt out of the tent I don't know we have a seven year old it's pretty funny like stay out Yeah boy he doesn't go in and out of the tent a hundred times And use it as a play uh they like to play in them Yeah I don't know Yeah well what we were doing we were just going to say we're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night so you know no going in and out and or what he wants to do we had brought his friend along was play in the tent It was like no this is not working you can't do that you get the tent all dirty Plus you get it all wet we were at a beach site too No but you know I was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they are really nice and um up here we have uh we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime They're terrible they're really terrible Uh but there's this one campsite that it just some of them are known but there is one that's out in this big lake and it's it's it's mosquitoes are terrible and then there's this there's this other one that's more up in the mountains but it surrounds a man-made reservoir and there's no bugs that's the whole thing that everyone told me oh I'm I was going to go to Lit- Little River State Park that place is great there's no bugs But oh okay because uh we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas we were really affected bad by it but really got it um almost destroyed the ch- the tourism in one town because of the mosquitoes they're so bad Yeah that was it's a really nice area I've been there before and it's I I couldn't imagine ge- living just sixty miles north of them but they were plagued they were plagued with them with mosquitoes And you can go out outside in the daytime all right but the minute the sun went down um that's when it's usually the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out just the very second it's really strange They uh they must uh work on that you know the i- it gets cooler when the sun sets and then they all come out Oh yeah yeah I never really noticed how effective they were but um because that wasn't really I bought them I really didn't get to use them like oh there's mosquitoes let's turn them We just sort of lit them And um we weren't bothered that much by mosquitoes so we didn't really contribute it to that But um I think in an area that's really thick with mosquitoes I can't see all this little uh smoke buckets I call them they work but they're suppose to work really well Oh I'm in my paperwork here that's what I do when I wait for a phone call I get in my paperwork Oh to find my most important parts But I don't know I don't know if I'm going to go I wish was an avid camper and I could really talk about like gardening or something you can talk about that a lot but um I do want to go again We just moved to a new hou- into a house so I don't think camping maybe in the backyard but I don't see going on a camping trip probably until next summer So it's easy for you to go Um oh God <> I don't know but that sounds that my my kind of camping it really does Yeah okay um well um that is is to have a a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent Yep Um Well those they're kind of nice but they're also um flimsy when you really look at them But when you get inside they're really nice you know everything's really but then when you look underneath them it's just got these little wheels and this little axle it's like oh my and then a big windstorm it would pick you up Oh jeez yeah what do you what do you do when you get a like a really violent storm like a tornado just stay in your truck I wouldn't stay in the um Oh So then were they successful But it took them a little while Yeah so did they get stuck Yeah huh Well so they evacuated it Wow Yeah I know I always I like to get right on the water yeah by the campsite it's so we have lean-tos up here I really like them like I say they're kind of just kind of more sturdy than anything you know just just Yeah they're they're lean-tos They're + um slash error Yeah they're  pretty nice they're they're uh it's like a little house except the whole face is open and the one time that we went we got one it was overlooking the water but it was a big embankment I wanted to get one right on the water we had an electrical storm too and it was really it was neat sitting there watching it it was raining when we called home everybody said oh we were worried about you in that storm
