I don't I don't think they should be forced but I think they should be I guess encouraged to to do some kind of public work I guess to just to get them I guess involved with community maybe you know just community activity If nothing else see how the city works stuff like that Yeah I kind of I think so too I think that's a bit dramatic but but other than that I think it's it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and you know like the uh shelters and uh that kind of thing helping out uh volunteering I guess if they can Yeah Your right I do too I think they start out young like in uh Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts <> doing s- Ex- Right that's see that's what we did in Girl Scouts and that got you involved real good and it I think it starts kids out on the right track and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing Something Yeah I do too I think I think a lot of people a lot more people volunteer than than uh than we than get credit for it as you know like in hospitals and uh and the shelters and stuff like that And even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays at least they're getting out and doing it and you know helping helping out I think that's good and Yeah yeah Yeah There you go Right Yeah it sounds pretty good That sounds good I've noticed a lot of uh different organizations in our community uh pick up like on the highway and stuff and I think that's pretty neat They uh go along and have so many miles I guess of highway to take over and they clean it up And keep it clean I think that's I pretty good idea And I think you know again I've seen a lot of young kids doing that and I think it gets them prepared to to learn how to volunteer as they get older I know I did you know in Girl Scouts and everything and after that in high school I would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that So Oh Yeah I'm in Texas Where are you at New York Oh gosh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Oh no Oh Golly Are you serious Oh my God how do they live Yeah I haven't heard a thing Lord Go- Well that's good That's great Right Yeah Right Right slash error That's one thing we do at our church is uh we have a group called Hearts and Hammers and we go along and I'm really not sure how we find the individuals but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that n- desperately need it and uh we go along with all the material and in one day more or less go in and say roof paint fix whatever we can Yeah and spend a day doing that's really neat it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time but you know every little bit helps Uh yeah They uh luckily we have a a man who owns a building company So he donates a lot not everything but a lot of the material Then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy Yeah And it's not you know we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it you know so much as we just want to help people out So it's real neat It's + Yeah it's  like I say it's not a lot but it helps people Like this last couple we helped you know they were in their eighties and she was bedridden and I just you know just tears your heart out to to see this kind of thing and you know if you can do any a little bit it helps so Yeah Yeah Gosh That's great That's a lot That's that's a lot of kids though Oh well still that's a you know that's a good chunk of kids Yeah Yeah That's neat That's great That's great But uh like I'll agree with you though I don't think they should have to do a year Yeah I don't think that some people I don't think have uh a year in them to volunteer if you know what I mean They're not worth it <> Right Oh yeah that's true that's true Oh I couldn't either I couldn't either Right right Yeah I just know one person that's in the Peace Corps and she's a teacher and and just wanted to do it She'd been a teacher for a while Just decided she wanted to do it so I'm grateful for people like that but I don't see how they can  just + Yeah just  pick up and head on out I wish I could do something like that but I can't so Right that's the way I am I know the feeling That's right We're against it That's right You too and I hope everything works out up there Yeah Good good that's great Yeah Well good luck Thanks Bye <>
