Yeah I uh consider myself a hacker How about you Yeah uh I'm not as good as I'd like to be but it's a No I don't think so Uh I'd started playing when I was in elementary school actually We lived really close to a par three golf course And I'd go up there with friends after school a couple of times every week and then for uh for years I don't know after elementary school all through junior high and stuff I didn't play cause I think I just got so frustrated when I was little I'd my body wasn't you know physically developed and all that kind of stuff/ and then I'd started picking it up again a couple of years back and I've really been enjoying it Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Uh-huh Right Th- the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of playing golf it's a great game but to play a really nice course you've got to have a really big wallet Yeah Uh-huh Right Yeah I uh attend the Indiana University and it's the same way here They have a really nice championship style course that is fairly reasonable to play on Uh a little bit but not a whole lot I you'd think you would but uh you don't so I Uh well they range anywhere from about five bucks for your basic city type course up to fifty sixty dollars for a really really nice course Uh-huh My dad is a member of a golf club over in my home town and I can play for free there and it's a pretty nice course Yeah And I guess well it's free for me Somebody's paying but not me Yeah Yeah definitely As far as watching golf I can watch it on T V but it's kind of boring It's nice to see those who guys They have such good style that uh it's uh it's pretty fun to watch Right Yeah Uh-huh What I really I uh had a chance they had the P G A tournament up in Indianapolis last year and I was able to go and see one of the rounds of that and that was really fun you knew it I never really thought it was would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch but man it was it was something else just to follow those guys around and actually watch them play Right You got it's uh it's a lot more exciting than actually w- than watching it on T V And if you pick a group of golfers and follow them around it's just watching them the whole time instead of like on T V you get to see them make a tee shot and then they go off to some other hole and they come back when they're putting but you know it's really something else Uh I'm a student right now Yeah At uh Indiana University Uh I don't really know I'm a math computer science major right now No I wi- it'd be nice to be a pro golfer it seems like that that would be an okay life just to hang out and Yeah Huh Oh yeah Well you know it seems like well you go to work every weekend Play maybe one two tournaments a month You come in about tenth you'd still be doing pretty well So Yeah Uh-huh Right Yeah And those fees to join a club Like a million dollars or whatever is just that is out of control you'd really want to really be liking your golf Yeah I saw one of those on T V That is pretty wild Yeah
