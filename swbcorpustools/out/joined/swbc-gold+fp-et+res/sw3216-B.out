Yeah Uh what what contacts do you have with the public school sy- Oh okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah yeah Well I think that's I think that's uh true I I've got a little different uh contact but I've I've got a one son that graduated from high school last year and another son that's a a sophomore this year and uh my wife teaches kindergarten here in Richardson Uh but in general I I think the the you know one of the reasons that we we uh the chose to live in Richardson when we when we came here was the was the schools and I think that Plano and Richardson in terms of the uh things seriously wrong with the public schools are not nearly to the extent th- that uh right right And I think I think part of that is that is the the uh a big part of that is just the demographics the population in those schools are are typically uh people that very much value the education and support the the school systems and and uh although there's still some still some problems but uh I you know I when I was when I was going to school I grew up in Iowa and and in my family school was certainly valued but if there was ever any sort of a uh if ev- if I was ever in trouble in school I was also in trouble at home even more so and I think that part of it is is not exactly with the schools but with the with the uh the culture that doesn't doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support uh what the schools are are trying to do Yeah that's true Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Yeah Well uh she she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher She has she has two half day classes So she has uh you know on the order of twice as many students as as the teachers in the higher grades and uh uh but her her background is in is in uh child development and and uh so forth and so kindergarten is as high as she as she wants to teach and she's she's teaching rather than something else because that that that's the jobs that are available and that the schedule matches uh you know with our kids and things like that So yeah uh and but uh the
