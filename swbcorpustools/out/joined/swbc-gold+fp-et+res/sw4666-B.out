Actually I'm in like I said I'm in Minneapolis and the big thing up here of course is the twins Uh No it's it's pretty pervasive It kind of goes into about all aspects of society I think up here But uh actually I don't know how much of the World Series you caught last year but that was a lot of fun Well to be honest with you I'm not from Minneapolis In fact I've only been up here a few months and I'm going back at the end of next month Uh Orlando Florida So I'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything But Oh yeah Oh Uh-huh Right Oh okay Yeah I haven't followed it real closely at all Uh except like I said last year when the World Series rolled around I did I did follow that pretty religiously Went out into the bars you know drank a beer watched the game had a gir- a good time that way But uh Is that right Uh-huh Uh real good as far as I can tell People are pretty excited about it Well yeah Sorry about that yeah Uh as far as the Twins are concerned it seems to be real good Uh my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago and they they won that one seven to one so uh that's pretty good I guess It looks like they'll be doing pretty well Are you still there Okay I heard some noise on the line Didn't know what happened Oh okay All right Yeah Uh-huh Well maybe that has has good tidings for their uh for their season coming up I've actually got a friend that's living in San Francisco right now Uh he's doing the same thing I'm doing which is basically uh an internship We we're both doctoral students and he's doing his with I B M and I'm doing mine with Honeywell But uh I I think he kind of follows the sports and I think he's mentioned uh the Oakland As a couple of times Uh he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good As far as I know yeah And in the major leagues I guess there is a couple of different divisions and then of course there's the minors Uh I don't know I I guess I'm one of those people that if I really made a concentrated effort I could really probably get into baseball Uh but I was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago right after that game and he offered you know to take me to one of the games because apparently he'd bought uh he and four other people from Honeywell had bought a seat a row of seats actually for the home games But the thing is there's like eighty-six home games per year So there's no no way that you can ever use them all Eighty-six I was amazed to hear that You know that's just the home games and I I thought it was a mistake but he goes no Yeah Well just about yeah Yeah And that's you know yeah that's almost That's a lot of baseball Well you yo- if you if you consider it the season starts well it's the season started about a week and a half ago and it ends with the World Series which usually takes place I believe in December or January Yeah I think so It did last we- year didn't it Or was it November Maybe it was November I'm thinking about I know it was doggone cold up here Uh Well I know for sure it was I know it was after September Because that's when I got up here And and it was at least two months after I got up here Yeah so it had to be November anyway
