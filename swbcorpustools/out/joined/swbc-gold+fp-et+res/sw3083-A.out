Okay what do you think is the biggest problem Uh-huh Uh-huh Yeah Is it the do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the values they get from home Right Yeah I I I I think that the biggest problem is uh with the uh with the home environment being part of it You know if I think too many parents expect uh the school to teach uh the moral aspects of of things to the st- to the kids and you know while we're not going to worry about uh teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then expect them to pick it up at school you're not going to do that you know you're going to carry carry with carry to school uh out into the world you know what you learned at home and uh uh I think that that part of that showing up now you know with with things because kids I think have probably less respect than for for people than in in other things than we may have seen in the past uh and part of it's the the family I think and part of it's uh the living conditions of certain people are subjected too drugs is a big problem now and I think that's that's that's another root problem Uh-huh Right Right Well I think it's like you say it's it's the socioeconomic mix there you know the they're you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids who are basically uh that might be more well to- well off you know going to a private Catholic school or whatever uh and and they're not all that way but you know some that are um that they're they're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city uh you know public schools Yeah Yeah well you know in a lot of cases like that where you know if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it's it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education It shows I think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know and that may be passed on down to the kid as well and uh maybe they pick up on that And then from the other aspect um maybe the uh school itself has has has more emphasis on uh trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller uh they may be able to to give the resources that's needed to uh to do a good job Uh that's a tough question how to fix the school system Uh with uh I would try to I guess to see about getting parents more involved with try to to come up with more ways to do that Uh uh uh stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students and uh more more classes that I think that are and I think this is happening some around the country in terms of um morals trying to teach the kinds of things that that aren't getting taught at home and uh and and respect for other people Uh I think that's a big part of it You know people you know if you don't care about property and people you know you're not going to care about uh about learning I think You know you're not going to really care about yourself Right Well you know and I that's not an ea- but that's not an easy task you know that's why I say it's it's a tough question what would you do +  because you know even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when uh when when you're growing up in you know in a home which may be uh just the pits and uh you don't have any any kind of a good environment to live in you know it's kind of hard to say well you need to take care of other people's stuff as well when you're when you barely have anything yourself So I could see where that would be a problem and I think that's I think it's
