Are you a T Ier No Is somebody in your family a T Ier Oh okay so who do you work for So you don't have any benefits at all to talk about You're just going to have to imagine what you would like as benefits Oh okay okay Well in in interviewing have you ever discussed benefits with some of the potential employers Didn't get that far Yo- you normally just try to sell them on your uh aptitude and not you know well how much vacation do I get Oh well Well I'll tell you a little bit about what T I has as benefits We do have uh like most companies we have medical insurance Although they're tending to try to really cut costs more and more Um what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to um set hospitals in the area They call it network hospitals They're hos- Yeah they're hospitals that they're uh agreeing with uh T I that they'll be a certain rate you know for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep co- you know costs down Now they're going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors So it's almost like a um uh an H M O you know kind of thing that uh only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage If you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get We have some dental coverage now um but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile Like I've had a couple of crowns recently and if you didn't have the extra dental plus um you only get like a third of your cost which can be kind of expensive with a crown So I I pay yeah I pay for the extra dental plus so much more per month because it always seems like if you're going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more Um we do have pension although I've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good and I know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that After you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go is that all that's in there I don't think's it's going to pay too long when I get out Um we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago um it's not an I R A it's called a four oh one K plan It's kind of like pension You put in so much money and then T I um meets you half way up to a certain maximum So like I put in a dollar they put in fifty cents So that grows pretty good and I think that will be more of something I can see of a pension than the regular pension plan Of course you can buy stock in the company but you know that's not always a real for sure kind of thing Cour- Yeah especially with this one you know it kind of goes up and down I don't know if it's any different than other companies but you hate to have it fluctuate and like you know last year it was forty dollars a share and now this year it's thirty six dollars a share and you go gee I'm losing money Doesn't quite feel as good And we ge- you know vacation normally after you're here for six months and you start to get like five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you And it's one nice thing about T I is after you've been here uh for five years you get three weeks Which a lot of places make you work like ten years or so before you get that much And we get some we get uh decent holidays Um a- at Thanksgiving we always get the two days off which is nice to make a nice long weekend And at Christmas we always get two days at Christmas They float it around depending on which day of the week Christmas falls on So that's nice so you always get two days at Christmas A lot of people just take you know that week I normally take that week somehow you know You only have to take three days of vacation and you get the whole week at Christmas time Whoa okay Uh-huh Um Uh-huh Oh yeah Yeah I think uh um I don't use the services but yeah I think sometime last year or just recently they started to give some kind of eye coverage You get discounts on uh glasses and I'm not quite sure there's certain places you can go to that have uh discounts for people that work here So you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that Um Uh-huh Yeah Yeah Uh-huh Yeah Gee that's pretty decent Right and you get some extra ones Federal workers always seem to get you know you get Columbus Day and Veterans Day and those ones that you couldn't really care about so much but you get the day off anyhow Oh yeah okay Yeah we're doing an H M O right now um and when we go to get prescriptions it's five dollars so- but so- you know sometime sometimes when you go you know the prescription like my husband always takes which is kind of like you know Contact stuff only better Um you that's like a buck a capsule So if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty-four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings Then there's other times that you know maybe the prescription wouldn't cost more than like seven or eight dollars and you pay five anyhow So it isn't a
