Bye <> <> So we're uh our discussion's about uh the care of the elderly Uh well I actually my dad's my dad's almost ninety and he lives by himself and he's in good shape Uh but uh some friends of mine have uh gone through this I think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and uh where they did some things to try to keep them um mentally alive And where there was uh caring and compassionate where there were caring and compassionate people uh operating it Do you have any experience with this yourself Uh-huh Uh-huh From the lack of stimulation you mean Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with that the people who operate it seem to have what you'd perceive of as genuine concern Uh-huh Yeah Yeah It it's possible I was thinking also that there'd be there could be a fair burn out factor um in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need Uh-huh Uh-huh So it gives them a sense of identity Yeah I I think part of what you're saying matches what I h- have read I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who uh were adequately deficient in their abilities uh physical or mental that they couldn't take care of themselves But I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide um a lot of social activities Uh the one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation Uh and Well I think it I think t- it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there and I feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like like put her in there And there there's so much
