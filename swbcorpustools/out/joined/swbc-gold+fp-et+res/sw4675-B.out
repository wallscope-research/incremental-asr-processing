All rightie Yeah I sure do Uh I have it's pretty much a ledger sheet and I just write down e- all my bills how much I'm going to have to pay and I do it per paycheck for me which is every other week Uh I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments you know everything And it tends to work out pretty well that way I can anticipate you know a little better I usually try to guesstimate and then when the bill actually comes in I go ahead and fill in the actual amount That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left at the end of the month or at the end of the paycheck anyway So that works okay for me Right Uh-huh same here Uh-huh Oh okay Uh-huh Right Luckily I don't either you know maybe my cat would get sick but usually that's not so much that it would throw me off But you so you know what I'm saying yeah I sometimes it can be Sometimes it can be I guess the worst thing I've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things But I do try to build in a little extra money each month to to be able to do that type of thing so Uh-huh Oh uh-huh Oh that's tough My roommate only gets paid once a month and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking so Right I for for years got paid once a month and and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones but I would pay all of them at one sitting and I would know okay you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it And and it worked okay for me I don't know Right now I I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt I think as everybody is and so It's yeah it's really bad But uh it's going pretty well and I've got a real good plan mapped out here so Uh-huh Oh that's Yeah That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time That'll yeah That'll be good yeah most people are spending three or four months di- you know at least digging out after Christmas so Yeah I I was pretty fortunate this Christmas I didn't get in debt so Uh-huh Oh uh-huh It's so rare you hear anybody doing that any longer Yeah My uh roommate does sew some and and uh i- she hasn't sewed anything in a long time but I I'm sure that she could pick it up again My mother always sewed She tried to teach me when I was young but not interested Yeah Yeah But that's a real good way to save money though by doing that Uh-huh uh-huh Well that's a good way to to make a little extra money Well this is another way that I'm making a little extra money so that was you know nice that I tripped over this opportunity and you're actually my first call Yeah I had not uh done I I guess today today's my first day that I could even do it Yeah you beat me to the punch here I I was about to call to get to see if I could get on with somebody so so that was great Yeah Yeah I take have some money taken it and put in a Four Oh One K
