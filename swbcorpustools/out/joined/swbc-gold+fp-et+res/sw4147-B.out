Yes we do have a pet We have a a dog that we got from the uh well we call it the S P C A It's the uh an- from an animal shelter Uh he'd come in there as a stray Uh he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross Uh well he was very well trained when we got him Uh he's No uh we suspect that he was hurt in an accident you know got away from somebody traveling through and hurt in an accident because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him And uh if they were local people they would have been able to find him Uh-huh Oh yeah Uh-huh Oh I think so Uh-huh <> Yeah Well I guess in one sense we felt that it it's nice to have a dog even though there are you know complications come with it And then with our children uh at the time they were oh grade five and and grade eight so it was an age where it was uh we thought it was be good for them to have the discipline that goes with with having a pet Uh Yeah right So Well that's the idea I think the reality of it is that they perhaps uh it depends on the on everyone's discipline And uh from that aspect I'm short on the discipline because I don't uh enforce that the kids look after the dog and uh we've had him about four years now Uh but I think it does it it you know it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly uh Yeah Uh Actually no we live in a in an area that's oh probably about two and a half miles from the university Uh we live right might say we live right in uh in the middle of a residential area And uh so that is not as good uh you know this dog being a small dog it's uh more you more acceptable but again Yeah Uh-huh Yeah it's uh that's one of the biggest concerns It's like uh there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal but the same time one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal and the larger they are the more room they need to exercise Right Well Uh-huh
