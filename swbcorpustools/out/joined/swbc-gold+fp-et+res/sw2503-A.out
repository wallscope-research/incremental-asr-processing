Hi Wanet <> How are you I'm from New England Massachusetts Wow This is quite a quite a long distance Do you have any pets How come uh you don't have any now You get tired of them Yeah I've got a little doggy uh that I've had quite uh quite a long time In fact she just turned sixteen years old New Year's Eve And uh I beg your pardon She's uh uh uh a poodle Uh a toy poodle a toy poodle and she's This is a little bigger than a teacup And uh it's funny how uh how I I uh a- acquired this animal Uh when I was uh married my uh ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy That she needed uh the woman needed someone to baby-sit and uh this is what she had told the kids and she even told me that And after the two week period was up uh she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it Well after you had an animal for a couple of weeks it's uh you become you become attached to it So I've had this dog now for for sixteen years and she's been a lot of company Uh she's uh however getting a little old and things are starting to fail Uh I I live alone now and she stays in the house all day while I go to work and uh she's been holding herself pretty well The uh up until you know recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is and uh I find a little present on the floor sometimes when I come home But she's she's usually pretty good Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh Well you might want to get yourself uh an animal that doesn't require much attention Like a cat Yeah Well my my personal preference is is a dog Uh I don't know that uh that I would ever want a cat Oh I like cats I just wouldn't want to own one Uh they're not uh they're they're affectionate but they yeah I don't know I can't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog Yeah right Yeah Right That yes we're supposed to appreciate them Well my my dog when I came home uh when I come home in the evenings my dog greets me at the door I don't know that a cat would do that uh Yeah Yeah yeah Huh I I think uh in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because uh she knows when I'm upset and I know when she's not feeling good too So I know like when she has an accident I know she's not doing it on purpose When when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me Uh and and you know some people might not believe that but but but uh I do Like if I if I put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours uh because I was going out She would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to to let me know that she was unhappy with what I did Yeah Uh-huh Oh yes Animals have a way of talking I I don't know that I'd uh that I'd trade my dog in for the world Uh it was about two years ago she got sick on me and I took her to the uh to the vet's because she wasn't eating and and uh she wasn't able to jump She you know lost all her activity and uh she stayed there for one day and the doctor called me up and said uh she had a low white cell count and that uh she wasn't she was dying and uh suggested that I take her to a working hos- dog hospital animal hospital So I took his suggestion and I uh took the the dog to a hospital The dog hospital there and they said they'd keep her there for three days Well she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care It cost me over five hundred dollars Plus the the uh the vet sent me a bill for what he did and uh then she recouped She was okay for a couple of years And then she got sick on me again and I brought her to a different vet this time and I told the vet what medication I had given her and everything And uh he gave me the medication the same medication that I gave her the last time and she was okay and she's been okay every since It's been about two years now Yeah Well the see the problem is if if the if someone would have came up to me and said it's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive What do you want to do I probably would have had second thoughts But what they well what they do is is they say well it's going to cost you know twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this and and you know and it creeps up on you You don't know that uh you know You really y- you don't know what it's going to until it's all over Uh to give you an example My mom had an elderly cat who uh whoever evidently got a hold of it and uh the cat got sick So she took the cat to the vet and she had the cat there for two days and then the cat died So the doctor had called her up and said uh your cat died and you owe me this bill and oh by the way do you want me to to bury the cat So it cost her three hundred dollars uh and she didn't get the cat back So yeah they had to pay for all the medical uh bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses And uh you know she just brought the cat in because he wasn't feeling good So that that was kind of a surprise At lea- Yeah Well even the you know they they claimed they did the best that they could have have and then the cat uh died So I'm I'm looking for another cat for them Uh I I've I've got a little kitten uh that's still uh just being born right now So another five or six weeks I'll be bringing the little kitten over to uh to my folks Yeah I I think it will because they're both in their in their seventies And uh the cat uh although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes it turns it turns out to be uh uh a pleasant experience for them Uh I think they enjoy that Yeah Yeah Well the same here Okay Bye now Okay What is that sound Oh okay I'll let you go Right
