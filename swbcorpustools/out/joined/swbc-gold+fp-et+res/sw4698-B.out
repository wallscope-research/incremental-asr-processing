Oh yeah Uh-huh Uh-huh Well I've I'm currently in school so I I've had an I B M clone I guess for a couple of years now which I've been trying continually upgrading I guess And uh I've found I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it and I can't really I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer uh simulation or analysis so it it's pr- very essential for me Schools have them uh but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school It's very easy it's much more convenient to have one at home At Georgia Tech Yeah so Yes actually Yeah it uh Um sure I have some games of course which I play on there and uh uh I have a program which allows me to access a uh weather data bank so I can like check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby So it provides other means other than just strict uh you know computations and so on so Have you do you have a computer for yourself at home Oh yeah Yeah Tha- Uh-huh Yeah yeah Do you use Email and like that Yeah It's I + I uh I have modem night computer so I can log into the sys- the uh network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful But uh yeah that's that and word processing is while I tend to obviously I do most of my almost all of my report writing on on my computer uh whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments So it's it's really become I don't know really become my mainstay I guess I can't even remember actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in in my life to do a a to do a report Because my family when I was growing up we got a basic computer T R S Eighty when they first came out And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high so Oh yeah Oh Yeah It must have been tough It's a little bit strange for me I I did my Master's thesis uh last year and I did that on a computer and it seems like I just can't imagine how people did it before It must have been just so much so much work Yeah So uh so yo- you used your son's Macintosh then Do you do you find it do you like that kind of computer Uh-huh Yeah Huh Yeah Yeah Well i- if if if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge
