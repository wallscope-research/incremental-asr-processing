All right Oh uh-huh uh-huh That's the way we always were We always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up So well I guess we're going to talk about children today So you ready My children are all gone already They're they're all out on their own So uh do you want to start first yo- yo- do you work Uh-huh Right <> Uh-huh Right Uh-huh Yeah but yet most of the problems we hear of course maybe that's what we hear about is from organized and approved day care centers But maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be You know the individual incidence or something Uh-huh how old is your oldest Oh well he's plenty big enough then Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh Uh-huh That's the way with me I I worked four years one time but my last two children were uh both entering high school age And uh they were of course gone while I was w- working so it wasn't a problem I saw and I stayed home the rest of the time I so I didn't have that problem either Now I have I my oldest daughter she has two children and they've been in day care uh she works full time It it's difficult but yet she's the type of person that I don't know if she'd be happy staying at home Uh-huh She she surprised me though She's done a lot of things that I never thought she would do you know with with the family because she was m- the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children So she is she spends a lot of quality time I think when she is with with the children And uh sh- they've used the day care most of the time They tried one once They had a lady come in And uh she she also had a small child she brought with her And it did not work out Uh at all It she thought it was going to She was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out in the morning but uh I- th- the lady called and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble And this baby is the is the most pleasant uh real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually And and she was having problems with her and so she called and said things were okay settled down and was all right Well my daughter decided to call them and check and things weren't okay Her her one son was watching the soapies which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies And the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out and the baby-sitter was in the kitchen with her baby And so that ended that episode and she was most upset uh over finding this So uh she they kind of had decided that the day care was better There's uh more people involved more than one adult they and the age groups are separated <> And uh slash error Uh-huh Yes story time uh and the this one has been particularly nice It uh it kept track of what they did and they would tell the parents what they did that day You know if they said anything or did anything So it kind of ac- i- kept them Yeah I oft- I always thought that if you were checking into a day care that you would be good to get references uh on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there Because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying you know if there was a problem they they would I think be more ready to tell you what it was They may not say anything And uh other than how else how do you judge other than from what others have uh what you see uh the cleanliness and that type of thing Uh-huh <> Uh-huh But it would be real difficult to pick you you know to find one and decide Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh uh-huh <> Uh-huh Yeah <> Yeah I- it worked out good I'm going to I've decided I'm going to baby-sit my two granddaughters Since they'll be going back at the end of the month And so I'm going to give it a try I I I sell Avon and Stanley products and I've got that worked out My husband he's retired so he's going to deliver my products so I'll do my orders and that by phone So um I'll be able to keep that up a little bit But I th- I think I'll enjoy doing Yeah I I think I'll enjoy I I guess I kind of miss having a baby around A kid around or something Yeah Right That's right Well they do say you enjoy them more a some somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun they would have had them first Uh-huh Uh-huh <> Yeah My daughter always said she would not let me baby-sit because you do hear grandparents complaining you know because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much But they're the ones that complain a lot are the first
