Well uh uh that's something I've thought a lot about Uh I I work in a hospital And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients Uh when they asked us did did we want to uh keep it the same or uh spend more spend less I think uh I think right now what they're spending is adequate Uh my for my personal opinion Uh because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a uh vaccine for I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with or I think they already would have by now you know And uh so I don't know if if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now I think they're doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know And uh what about you I'm not either I'm definitely not aware of how much Uh that's something I've never really kept up with at all Uh I don't I'm not sure uh I know uh I've always thought more about the disease rather than the der- research you know what I mean And uh that sort of thing Uh if if we were talking about the money uh I'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough simply because I don't know that much about it You know Oh yeah I think so I think so Yeah Yeah Yeah Well that's true That's true because uh it's a such an easily preventable disease Uh No It's definitely not That's true that's true Uh Myself uh uh I'm just recently about to get a divorce and uh course I'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody I can or anything But it's sort of scary to find yourself single again you know And uh because you never know what's going to happen You don't know who you're going to come across you know Course it's it's not that I'm wanting to I'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody I see But it's something you got to think about these days A single person You know and uh it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry And uh Certainly Yeah But uh uh I know that uh in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything And uh I don't know I don't think that's a bad idea I know it uh sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction It just sort of keeps that going But uh I don't know at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS so far cannot be You know so I don't know that I think that's I'm not too a- much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself I don't know what do you think about that It + this "it" needs separate slash mark because B108 is an "aa" with A107 not necesarily the original intended continuation of this utt It  really is It really is They gave us a hard topic Uh-huh That's true That's true Yeah You know I guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have to come first I guess as far as something to to do about it So so I don't know Uh course there's so many things in the world where if you solve one problem you may be creating another you know And uh so I guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse Which is the most important to solve at the time and I don't know But uh but I've never looked into how much money they're spending I have I have no idea And I know a lot of our tax money goes to that But uh I really have never looked into it I have no idea Yeah Yeah Right sure Yeah Yeah I think it is I think it is Yeah it does every It seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would You know But uh That's one thing I've never really feared Uh uh I a lot of the my family you know they fear me working like that and under some some of those conditions but uh uh I don't fear it at all Uh I work in in the operating room a lot and uh and of course when w-
