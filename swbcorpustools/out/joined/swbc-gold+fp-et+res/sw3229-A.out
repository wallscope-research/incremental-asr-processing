Okay while I was waiting for you to connect I I thought of a couple of menus so I decided it had to be in it informal or not You know if it's informal I'd probably choose something just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill slash error--two utts because that's a lot of fun especially this time of year where it's so nice out sv Um if it was formal I'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something I'm not I'm not into formal dinner parties but I'd probably go with lasagna a green salad and garlic bread Um I have a PILLSBURY cookbook I got when I was married but it's kind of the bible of cooking for me Then I have some from like church that are more family recipes that are more useful You know budget cookbooks but and of course you get a lot from when you're growing up Um I cook a lot the same as as my mom did of course I've added several different recipes but what you serve or what would you Well that's good Uh-huh Uh-huh Huh Yeah that would be wonderful in these times Yeah either they're really fast or slash error Uh-huh Uh-huh What's one of your favorites Uh-huh Wow sounds too good Yeah Yeah that THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK That sounds fun I find a lot of the cookbooks that I don't know that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients or things I don't keep on hand all the time and I have young children and our budget's set you know at this time but I want to use simple recipes that I have things on hand I don't have to run to the store to buy or look for something I haven't heard of That's why sometimes I shy away from uh more of a traditional cookbook but well it was interesting talking to you It's a fun subject Food is one of my favorite things too Anything else you wanted to add Oh wow Uh-huh that's good Uh-huh Uh-huh That sounds good That sounds really good It sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than I am I'm pretty simple right now but Yes that's probably that's true I have little ones and we and they won't eat you know too many different foods right now Yes Yeah Yeah Spaghetti's a pretty staple every other week or so and it goes a long ways too So slash error All righty Talk to you later maybe
