Oh go ahead I I am glad to talk to an expert I always wanted to know who an expert was Uh well there there's two things uh the one I'm interested the most I guess myself uh would be the the Freons for air cond- the one I guess that's the one I'm most curious about is how they're going to replace the Freons in air-conditioning That seemed to be the biggest surprise to me and whether when they replace it you know they're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad Yeah I uh was uh you know where they were all concerned about that but that that it seems to be No I heard about it though Was that before I didn't see it was that before they actually did that or it was w- Because of that you know Right Are you d- you didn't work at T I Oh okay Where do you work in research or Oh okay Oh okay yeah Yeah Uh well I'm kind of a car buff myself I was going to ask you another question but uh I- I'll do that in a minute I I think that the changing you know from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage you know no- not using No no no Really Oh I'm a car buff too we ought to wor- talk about that one day uh uh I think you can use the you can use high you know the ninety-two percent uh ninety-two octane I don't think you'll have any trouble Oh yeah Yeah No I I think uh I uh work on my own cars and uh I don't think that's a problem I thought I'm saying I was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline 'n Uh oh ye- i- the same thing about the war uh or related to the war on I was watching C N N and I cannot remember what station it was what did you see the advertisements uh where they talked about nuclear war what that would have been like in changing the atmosphere it is so scary that I hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster you know Did you see any of those uh I it was It must have been channel thirteen I don't recall although I thought it was on C N N oh I It was a somewhat of a commercial because it c- I saw it regularly and it showed that and it was really devastating and it would uh how much ash would fall and and how it would essentially literally destroy the world you know Oh really yeah there there's probably a lot of natural things uh Yeah Uh it I guess it's got to be really I don't know I don't know if it's air pollution it's uh it's dust pollution whether it's natural or not I don't know Yeah Oh yeah well I live in Arlington and there there there are no buses there there is the only school bus the only buses you see are school buses so Well I know it it's uh you know the car is we have this big romance with the car but uh I think people are would be interested if you had one Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Well you said you were car buff uh I think that uh all of us could use one electric car right now today because I think uh you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever yeah when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car but I think we all could in a family say have an electric car where my one of my daughters or my wife my wife she could use one now if they had one you know because they she don't even she doesn't put fifty miles a day on the car No no you're right I I have seen them but uh they have a battery car Uh I went to the auto show this past week and they did not endorse now that I think of it and I was so interested in the auto show I didn't think to ask anybody there were no electric cars I was surprised but now that you just mentioned that Yeah I I think uh there could be a lot of peo- I thi- people close this is really we're we're nine years away or less I guess from the next century and I think Yeah they've got a they've got a area over in the S M building too which is uh but it's a solar uh it's for uh the- g- gots some money from a power company and it's probably more generating power for you know uh electricity a hundred and twenty volt or whatever No I'm actually in the south building but uh I was uh I'm the facility so I've been in all most of the buildings anyway Oh yeah well the the solar area is right right around from the auditorium now And it they've got several different uh areas where they're called solar lab It's right there on the first floor you look walk by there Yeah but the solar project you know T I's been into it for years and I guess it's just not uh economical yet because of the other fuels Yeah I've seen some I think then again I'm surprised now I didn't think they'd asked anybody when I was in the auto show There was nothing uh and there was no d- place for air pollution or companies or anyone there It was just pure automobiles There Huh I didn't see did you go Oh Uh I was uh quite impressed with all the cars you know the engines are so much smaller now and everything and they're they all have brand new engines even General Motors uh very few only the Caprice and them and the Cadillac had eight uh the old V-eights they're all brand new engines uh of course they're burning gasoline of course Yeah and uh whether you know that's one way you know uh uh f- on air pollution I I I don't know if the automobiles are the biggest contributor or not really They've got catalytic converters everyone seem to have gone to that whether they last uh and do a good job and now that they the inspection systems are analyzing that uh well what do you think if you're in that you know if you're concerned about that if you're you're you're knowledgeable on that
