Do yo- are you on a reg- regular exercise program right now Oh well I'm kind of off and on Right now I'm kind of off Okay what type of exercise do you do Okay I guess you don't enjoy that very much Do you find that uh to be boring Yeah Well I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring But I Yeah I haven't decided whether whether I want to play yet or not I just bought myself a solo flex machine I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V It's one of those uh universal type machines exercise machines But I haven't really sat down and used it match yet so it's collecting dust right now I used to jog somewhat Uh-huh well that's good Yeah my parents have a treadmill it's when I go visit them uh I get on that thing every now and then Uh-huh I just got the bicycle out today and it was real nice outside had to get out to do something I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold so thought I better better get outside and do something and not waist the day But uh yeah I need to start jog something again I've always of that to be uh really one of the best forms of exercise but it's terribly boring and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently No I never have Well I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries I usually only go about a mile or two Yeah it's it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt Suppose to be much better if you find grass uh or or dirt to jog on You have to have the right type of shoes too that's very important But Yeah I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often my don't get very much use Uh-huh I usually enjoy the exercise I do but uh like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a a program So I'll I'll bicycle I get into that for for a little while and maybe go out uh on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile but then I'll get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week But uh that gets old too in a very short order I'm I'm hoping that this uh solo flex will uh uh change things a little bit I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis Yeah Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can uh start some type of uh regular program I've always found that uh when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep uh keep something going Uh when I was in high school we had a choice of uh taking uh physical education courses on exercise an uh one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine lifting weights and uh working out like that And that was very helpful we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks I found that to be uh very helpful Uh I need to I haven't started yet but uh it's a thought Sounds like something I should do How often do you uh uh go out each week on your walking Okay how far about how far do you go walking Okay Well that's good Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging It Sure Well if you keep up with a consistent pace just to uh keep the heart rating going uh Yeah Yeah But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is Um do you go to an aerobics class or do you watch on T V Okay Which uh shows do you watch on T V Oh okay okay like a Cathy Smith workout or Jane Fonda Okay Right I ev- every now and then I'll watch E S P N I get cable on T V and they have uh a couple of shows called basic training and uh what is the other one called Uh-huh BODIES IN MOTION that's that's the name of the one I was thinking of With Gill Yeah he- he- he's not bad his assistants usually aren't either They're always in in Hawaii some place On on the beach Yeah well they they do low I pact stuff now why utt this is notes about transcription they're on every day Yeah every morning It's on E S P N uh at what time I can't remember what time It's uh you know I can't remember offhand what time Yeah Yeah every now and then Uh-huh well I found that they they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day Monday through Friday incase you're interested in that again why utt I actually taped a few session that they had on there but uh I haven't done so much as uh watch the tape that I made So I'm kind of bad about that myself Okay well I sure enjoyed to you about exercise and fitness So all right Good night Bye
