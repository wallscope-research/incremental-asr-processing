This is Archie Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES Have you ever lived in that part of the country Have you ever visited it I think it was the black hills of South Dakota Well I lived in Omaha for five winters and that rolling kind of uh Yeah Is is fairly famili- The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics apparently it's going to win everything Uh and I had been told you know you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of Well the interesting thing was is I had heard that and I I I tend to I think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great And and it was the thing is it was it was a good story And and and I guess that's what I really like Although I must admit I did look at my watch after about an hour Yeah No I've heard I've heard that's really great though No You must really keep up Well isn't isn't SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY isn't that a i- is it is it a terror movie or is it just suspenseful Do you do you listen to Gary Cogill Is uh do you know who he is He's a the movie critic Um oh you've oh okay He's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas And he does uh he has a talk show on the K L I F Anyway it's on from seven to nine or something And and and people call in and it's if you keep up with movies it's kind of interesting There's a certain a mount of dribble that they do They've got uh they've got a couple of kids ten or twelve years old and they call in and they review movies But it's uh he anyway he it's interesting You listen to him and then you you go watch the movie In fact they had people had just seen I was listening Sunday night a little bit when I was going to pick up my daughter But anyway it was uh the it it's interesting though the the difficulty with with DANCING WITH WOLVES is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it uh the question is did he did he really know it was going to be good two utts or did he just do it Do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver A little piece of trivia You know the guy when he first headed out from the army post He he plays on MURPHY BROWN Yes He's he's Eldon her housepainter Can you believe that That's that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that I thought no it's really funny But I thought it it you think back and yeah it was him but with a you know with the beard and all that stuff it's uh Yeah Real scruffy looking and it wa- it was really funny it's uh that that he winds up playing in the movie But I thought it's good that you know it was a lot of fun I don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we're at about five minutes I should think we've done enough Well I don't know Why do we end this thing I think it just says hang up Why don't we do that Good-bye Sharon
