Uh I work for Georgia Tech Yes sir I work for the research facility Uh and it's it's kind of small in a sense but it it does have about uh I guess two thousand civil employees And on a a scale I guess it's still considered small It just have a lot of different laboratories The area I work in it it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so So that's make up most of the laboratory so from from that standpoint it's pretty small it's pretty small What about yourself Oh okay Oh okay I see Oh okay Right Uh Uh-huh Right Well those and probably the security aspect of it Because a lot of time nowadays even though you're working uh you're treated and it may not be true in every place In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a a person Because when it come down to layoff they don't really consider people and and you know their well being as far as you know how they going their next dollar going to come in How they going to pay their bills They just lay them off And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had uh I think the company still exists What they use to do is they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off you know That way that you know one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time And uh you know I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better you know other than s- you know something like unemployment is good but the company as a whole because you as an employee even the company is making money they paying you a salary but you are responsible for that company growth You're responsible also for helping that company get to the par- point that it's at at making profits So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than you know uh neglect or something like that You know Because it's not a person's fault that you know people not buying or businesses are are not on the up and up all the time you know I don't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but you know a number of people can can be the downfall of com- a company situation Well in a sense that say how do you make a a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people Uh for the bad times of the company What about the the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well You know In that standpoint Ye- yes I do I really do I think it'd be better that way and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that that there are problems and you know there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time You know That's just that's my views you know Right Right Right Well at least that would give a person a chance to look you know Because the way it is a person really don't have a chance
