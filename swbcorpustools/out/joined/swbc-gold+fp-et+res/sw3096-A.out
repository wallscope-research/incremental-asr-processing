Well uh ho- how do you view this whole subject Are you uh one who feels like you have have benefited from the change in in roles in women Or or what do you think Uh-huh Yes oh yes I think so Are you uh are you someone who works outside your home or have you Oh yes well uh have there been significant changes uh do you think in the employment place ex- especially uh say at T I Have has anything in particular changed that you have noticed During your time there Yeah uh-huh What what kind of work do you do Uh-huh Right Yes yes Yes uh yes in years past I know in fact even even the word drafter has changed because it used to be they were draftsman Right Maybe not huh Well uh I when I was in college I graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixty-four And I was a math major which was a real rarity among women at that time So I was in a lot of classes where uh there I was either the only girl or you know one of just a very few women in the class So that was a change and uh even uh I did not uh use my math uh in my work I I became a technical writer But uh even so there were very very few women in technical writing But that has changed a lot In recent years it has just really really changed a lot And and I think that uh you know the one thing that I have seen is that more and more women are getting into management but I think they have got a long way to go There was something on T V the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the heads of uh chairmen of the board chair- chair persons uh if you sa- if you will of the board are women in this country And I thought that you know that's pretty si- a pretty significantly small number So there are some some strides to be made there But uh I do not know I I think we have come a long way actually when I think about you know when things were like even when I you know just when I was in high school and how it is now for girls And uh uh I guess   my I uh the one  + my one  bad thing is that I am that I wish my mother had had some of those opportunities because I think she would have really she rea- would have succeeded in a lot of ways that men that women were not able to succeed in her generation So anyway Do you have children I was going to say do you have daughters That's always a good question Yes In fact I have a daughter who is in a a who just graduated in civil engineering from college So she is pretty much although there were some other women in her class she was you know uh one of the minorities uh females in the class So she definitely entering into uh a male profession But uh But you know for instance there are there is the organization women the Society of Women Engineers so that is recognized as uh you know a place where women should be But uh I do not know I you see it in uh also in uh like in church uh where more and more women are becoming ministers In uh you know in protestant congregations and uh it will be interesting to see if if Roman Catholicism ever uh recognizes women in in the role of priest I do- I do not know if you are Roman Catholic or you know what you know about that I am not either but uh that is one area where it that I can see might change but I really doubt will change No probably not Huh-uh So uh uh how about what in particular would you think that uh women still other than the work place where women still are being uh oh you know found wanting you know or not re- as highly regarded as men would be Uh I was just trying to think Oh I know something Maybe you could te- what do you think that what do you think tell me what you think about this The uh the uh the role of women in combat roles during the war Because I know that there now there they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles And the only uh branch in the armed fo- services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force And uh I spoke because women were filing flying missions into you know for whatever reason into uh in the Persian Gulf war And so But I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job It was real interesting they were I was listening to some of the comments on ra- television the other day uh about it and uh one of one of the men who was a I do not know if he was a general or you know what his rank was very high He said it's just a personal thing with me I can not be real you know I can not tell you why I feel this way but I just would rather have uh a man doing some of these jobs than a woman I thought well at least he was honest But that does not sit very well with a lot of folks I am sure Yeah right You know Neil well Neil as far as I am concerned {A and I could be wrong about this } but the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength to do something Uh because I would think I think you know mentally uh and emotionally I think women can handle a job and every bit as well So anyway it's still <> Sure No I would not either No I agree but I am sure that there are women who would would relish that you know kind of job So Uh I guess that should be taken into consideration as well So well this is an interesting topic um I have you know I have having a daughter who has gone into this into engineering I sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than I did She's a lot more forthright about her opinions and a little more assertive than I think I was So that's that's progress I guess Well I have enjoyed talking with you Lisa and Uh have you talked with a lot of people in this project or Yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Right Yeah well that's great that's good Yeah Yeah Well Yeah well that's good that's good because uh I I guess I placed all but one or two of my calls And uh only because I going to make some money see we our choir is doing this as a money ma- raising project We we got the connection through a T I uh church member And uh uh so we are doing it to raise money for uh a large project at church and uh so I feel like this is one way I can contribute that's not too painful Financially painful anyway It's just real nice that way so uh I thought well I will just get on the stick and do it Well I will say good-bye to you but I have enjoyed the conversation Thank you Bye-bye
