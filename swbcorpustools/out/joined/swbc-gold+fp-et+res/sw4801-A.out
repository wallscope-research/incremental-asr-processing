What do you think about capital punishment Yeah Which crimes do you feel that Yeah Because of so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent selling I think should also Yeah Uh-huh Yeah that's Go ahead Texas is too Texas I saw on T V the other night is the has had forty-six in like the past several years So they're pretty hip on it too I guess They do it by lethal injection at Huntsville Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah That's what's happening here There is like uh that's in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the the turnover rates of uh r- uh repeat offenders being let out and doing it again Uh-huh Yeah I wish if they were going to do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't Be a little more you know not being able to put it off for fifteen years Oh really Goodness Uh-huh Yeah Yeah <> I yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little little too lenient Uh kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas Uh audiology Yeah What do you do Oh really Oh really Neat Yeah I just this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California So I think it the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is what they gave a run down that Texas Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then Yeah Uh they they don't get repealed as easily as they do Like the guy in California got thir- you know twice before he went to the gas chamber and then they said okay no you don't have to go And then they took him back it just seems Yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent And then you have like two you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever you know No I don't I don't think uh the military doesn't execute anymore so Or death before the firing squad or whatever So I think about the only one is uh rape
