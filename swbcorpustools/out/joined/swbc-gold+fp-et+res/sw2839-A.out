All right Uh I guess what I feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it there's got to be something When when we pay so much for the for the debt instead of using the money for where it ought to go it it's just it's ridiculous What kills me is when they had a chance to to uh put into ac- action the the g- the Glen- Rub- what is it uh the act where they had to cut everything across the board they kept doing they kept putting off doing that Why did they do that That's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together Oh yeah I think so too Yeah well Things like mailings They don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things They just think once they get there that they can do just anything No they don't they don't try to uh to conserve And of course here at home we end up conserving and conserving and when I don't have money I don't buy something They sure don't seem to There are a couple of things I think we need to really work for and I don't know quite how to do it But I think we need to have the one line uh uh veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything If it's a good idea it can be done again You know and if it's not so what At least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months Yeah this is that's right Yeah Yeah that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on And the trouble is you don't you have so little input about it You don't know enough to know what what to do about some of this stuff I Yeah that's right The other thing about is I think uh limiting their time in office would be good I I just can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got Yeah Yeah I think that's right Yeah wouldn't that be too bad Well that's right I think I don't know I think uh people in general the the the idea of what you need to to exist is so outrageous that it's not hardly You know it starts at the courts it starts everywhere until we can't we've just lost control of of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable you know No you can't even can't even conceive of what they're talking about Yeah Yeah it jus- and and you just the other thing is it's it's all very well to give money to help people other people and I think we need to do that But there are they need to put more limits on them They need to restrain about what they do Yeah <> I I you know I think that's probably un- unless we can afford it if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again You know I don't really mind helping people but you you need to get rid of this thing that's that's just uh eating us up you know and get things on a on an even if it were if it were a family we'd be up before the the magistrate for for doing all these wicked things you know but the government does it and it's all right Yeah that's true Well sounds like Yeah it's good to see them doing some things there anyway Yeah Well I think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens we're going to have to bite the bullet And we're all going to have to do it I it just isn't fair though that when this happens in some places it needs to all come off everywhere That's why I thought well you know this is the time They need to put that into act- into action and show they mean business That they've got to cut they've got to cut costs Yeah I think that's right Well I don't I don't really mind paying taxes for for positive things that are helps like roads and making sure that uh that water is safe and some of these things But um you know it you just feel like it's out of control You feel like they do not have control of it And that and so then it just aggravates you you know you think I could spend my money I could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing So it's Yeah Well I think that's right If they don't do if they don't if they don't pull it in and start doing something I think they're really going to have to I think Yeah Yeah Yeah in some ways we're awful lucky I guess There a lot of lot of places where it's worse than it is here But still you don't want it to get that bad good heavens No we need to get try to get hold of it and and have it be things be honest and I guess in the fact I don't really mind paying taxes But I would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent That they're doing something that's positive for for somebody I don't really feel like uh I don't really feel like I use taxes very much I don't know maybe I do more than I I guess I do I use them in the in roads and lot of things but uh Yeah Yeah they've done some good things The state actually did some good good work on that in that a couple of years ago Uh Sam Johnson came out and talked to us about that about what they had done And they they really had done some good some good work Yeah Yeah there are a lot of p- places where they're in real trouble and and I think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too if they don't take if they don't take that early stand Yeah that's probably right The growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait until something til they need them Well it's good to talk to you Oh about nine No I just just a housewife I just heard about it and found it fun Guess I like to talk that's all Right Uh-huh Bye now
