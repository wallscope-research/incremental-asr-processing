Well do you exercise regularly Judy Uh-huh Well um I uh exercise regularly I work at a university and I swim almost every day upwards of a mile but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit Uh my daughter lives in Arlington and when I go to visit her I love to get out on that bike trail and either ride the bike oh gosh you can ride a bike practically all the way to Southern Virginia or just get out and walk uh or even jog a little although I don't do that regularly But Washington's a great place to do that Uh-huh Right Do you live in the District Because I think there're so many parts of the District where it's not very safe to get out and walk Uh-huh Well it's uh it's really both I'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape and uh and most of the time I enjoy it Sometimes I don't but I feel that uh that the discipline it affords me when I do it when I don't want to is also worth something And I often find that even when I don't feel that much like exercising like I'll be really tired and I'll start swimming and I'll and I'll actually get energy And I'll be have much more energy when I'm done than when I started I just feel great That happens to me probably one in four or five times that I swim And that's really a terrific feeling because you just go there at the end of the day and you figure God I'm ready for bed and you exercise and then it's sort of painful for a while but by the time you get done you feeling really terrific Yeah yeah So can I just ask you are you Canadian Philadelphia I'm trying to because you have a you have one funny vowel that's probably going to drive the T I people crazy Say out instead of out you say out Did you know that Huh Huh I see I know this isn't on our topic but where did you grow up in California Oh okay because I grew up in North Hollywood California went to U C L A and all that Yes Well same here Thanks for calling Bye
