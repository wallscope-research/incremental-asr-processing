Do I have pets Yes I have a cat and I have two dogs I have a Schnauzer and I have a Sheltie It it's a miniature Uh-huh Oh okay Well the Schnauzer I'm I'm watching for one of uh the managers where I work and he's been transferred to Germany for a while and I'm taking care of his dog and uh and I had just got the kitten when he asked me that and he says well my dog doesn't like cats and I said well we won't tell him it's a c- we won't tell her it's a cat because it was a kitten and you know they just they just love kittens They just are fascinated So she doesn't know that this is a cat yet And they get along real good I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty he'd flip listen So that was interesting It's a sheltie She's real s- sweet little dog She's got a very nice temperament Uh they're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer You know the Schnauzers are a little aggressive Uh-huh They're a good temperament and they and they just uh they I think they have a good head on their shoulders I think they have a a higher level of intelligence than other uh dogs that I have encountered Well yeah but also some poodles uh they're kind of there are some smart ones out there but there's some also some uh not so smart ones Yeah that's that's maybe that's there's uh some credence in that statement Uh-huh I I'd I really don't know what the best pet is I guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal Um slash error And bull dogs But I don't know about these uh these uh uh these pincers these now what are they called Pit bulls pit bulls that are so vicious Are they really I don't think I've ever seen one Well how do they become s- w- how did they get their reputation then Oh they train them to be that way then Oh okay Oh okay Oh dear so the the poor animal is doing it in self protection Oh dear Uh-huh Uh-huh Well that's unusual I Huh well I suppose you were surprised After the reputation that you know they have quite an uh uh notable reputation as far as you know Yeah they're banned from in some areas I understand Uh-huh You know that they must have just targeted that breed and said boy we're going Oh okay Oh okay Uh-huh Uh-huh Oh did it attack the child then Uh-huh Well the the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that Um slash error Sure yeah Yeah because then the the animal's in trouble and not the person
