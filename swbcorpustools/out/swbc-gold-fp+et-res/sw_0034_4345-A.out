 No 
 we don't have the national public radio in my area
 I can hear it at the college town nearby when I'm in Stillwater which is about an hour away 
 but the F M signal doesn't reach this far
 I'll listen to shortwave quite a bit 
 It gives you a whole different perspective on the news when you hear it from say a European point of view or from the country of origin 
 I agree with you too on the cable channel C N N and HEADLINE NEWS 
 I'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper which is why I rely on shortwave and then the cable C N N
 I think a lot of it is just the fact that in the U S you're so far removed in a lot of cases from say conflicts 
 or it's not happening in your backyard
 so the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than what's on shortwave 
 B B C is almost 
 they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it 
 and it just 
 they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions
 very much so 
 very much so 
 and I think a lot of it is especially T V news 
 they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to really decipher the news and to really explain it 
 I mean you know I think it's important to interpret it 
 but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to do the interpreting
 I like the straight reporting 
 and then I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it 
 it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it
 I always think it's humorous when the President gives the State of the Union for thirty minutes 
 and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard
 And a lot of time I don't hear exactly what they write into it
 So overall I think I would rather hear just straight reporting
 Yeah 
 I think people have that opinion 
 they want to sit down in front of the TV or read a magazine or U S A TODAY and read in four paragraphs and find out every-
