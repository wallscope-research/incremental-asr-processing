 okay 
 Yeah 
 the subject is child care and how to determine child care 
 and that's an interesting one for me to talk about since I have no children 
 but I did run a child care facility for a while
 And have some 
 I do have some thoughts on that 
 yeah 
 it's an interesting experience to be a surrogate or parent for a lot of people there 
 and it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities 
 Right
 Right
 Well right 
 in Texas we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate at an institutional level and at like a small home level 
 so you meet the standards 
 but then after that there's a lot more 
 I think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff is qualification of people who work there and in hiring people who would work at the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people in terms of not just 
 because somebody has a child or likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that 
 Exactly 
 And that was the most difficult thing of all to find the right people the qualified people
 
 exactly 
 And the other thing that's difficult in it's a too small setting like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child because you don't want to just warehouse the child 
 and I didn't want to run an institution where that was the case where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four five years or so important 
 and you have to have the right kind of enrichment 
 and that includes an atmosphere in which the child is safe and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for 
 but also his developmental needs are cared for too
 That would be lovely
 Uh-huh
 Well that's an interesting thought because 
 That would be okay 
 that would help on the other end too in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be
 Uh-huh
 That's exactly right
 Oh
