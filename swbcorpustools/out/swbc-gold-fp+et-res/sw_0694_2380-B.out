 Well this is kind of ironic because I work in T Is legal department
 And although we don't have any criminal actions here we do have other lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time
 And when was it 
 a couple weeks ago I was asked to go to jury duty 
 I wasn't selected 
 but for some of our cases in particular we have very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents and such
 And it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just you know happen to be selected in our jury to understand what we're talking about
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 you know some I don't 
 you always have the option 
 now in criminal I guess you always have a jury 
 but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not
 Yeah 
 and in some incidences I think they ought not to have a jury
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 Oh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well I've never fully served 
 I mean I've been asked twice to go down 
 but I didn't get elected on the panel 
 but I know that for a lot of the civil cases it's rare 
 I mean if your a lawyer there you could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the courtroom 
 there's a lot of attorneys like that that never get to the courtroom 
 their kind of law doesn't get them to the courtroom 
 but even in litigation which is doing lawsuits is a lot of times that you never get to the courtroom itself 
 and Yeah
 But it's a shame that 
 it's not so bad for the court system because the money there isn't being spent 
 but there's awful lot of money in time and effort spent in preparing for trial only to then finally get scared enough by going to the court 
 and usually it's the scare kind of the jury because you really don't know one way or the other how that jury is going to feel
 You could feel that you really have a very strong case and that you're very much right 
 but the jury may or may not see it that way
 so you get a little you know anxious there and go well you know I don't feel that sure 
 and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes you know the juries come down with a result and you go gee 
 Uh-huh
 really
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh really Yeah 
 and it seems a lot of times especially in criminals that their rights are so protected 
 but what about the rights of you know the rest of society 
 I mean we're protecting this person's rights who has broken the law 
 and we protect him so much 
 but what about the rest of the society 
 you know what are we doing for them 
 we're kind of you know forgetting about them 
 and I think sometimes that a criminal should kind of 
 if he breaks law especially it he's a repeater the law shouldn't just always cover for him that some of his rights as should be taken
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Jeez
 
 Yeah 
 I'd even go for trying to get some truth out of the witness stand if they come up with some pretty reliable lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the truth
 Yeah you know
 Yeah 
 I witnessed one trial many years ago when I was first studying to be a paralegal 
 and they barred priors on this person 
 and they never then told us I guess because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other
 And they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other 
 and the crime was attempt to commit murder you know
 but they never told us why these people were mad at each other 
 and gee you know 
 that's 
 Yeah 
 you know because they told us in school that you know crime has to be an intent you know has to be not just the act but you have to intend to do it 
 because there could be accidental kind of things you know
 but they never told us why these two people hated themselves or if one had done something to you know really aggravate the other 
 there was never any motive given 
 and I had a tough time with that 
 and being a person who saw what the jury didn't plus what the jury did because we were just observing you know there in the courtroom at the end of it all I still didn't know 
 I still have a lot of reasonable doubts 
 and I've seen everything presented 
 and you know they just haven't a real complete case here to my thinking
 I don't know that I want to sit on a jury like that 
 and you'd still you know 
 I want ask some questions here 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 Yeah 
 allow them to go back and deliberate and you know after each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like the next day bring those people back
 Right
