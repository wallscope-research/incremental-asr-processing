 what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I grew up in sixties and early seventies 
 and my mom didn't work at all when I was growing up 
 She didn't start working until I was well into high school
 So I had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids 
 Always home by the time you got home 
 Uh-huh
 it seems that there's a grass roots effort or whatever going on 
 I clean houses part-time
 and almost all the people that I clean for believe it or not are mothers that don't work 
 
 they're all 
 [ [ + and it's ] + I think it's ] kind of a new movement 
 it's going back towards you know 
 women have come into the work force in the last twenty thirty years 
 and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where you know women stayed home with the kids you know and try to give the kids quality time
 And I think you're going to see a lot more women choosing to not work after they have a baby
 I think with the salaries that 
 a lot of the women that I work for have husbands who are vice-presidents of companies 
 and I think with this it seems like it's more the upper-class people
 I don't see it as much like in my situation where I don't have children yet 
 but ideally I would like to be able to stay home with my kids 
 But realistically I'm realizing that's probably not going to be possible for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income
 Uh-huh 
 I think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids
 You know it's going to kind of go along with the B M W in the driveway or in the garage or whatever
 and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever
 Yeah 
 believe it or not though all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home
 they're real active in volunteer work
 one of the women is real active with Muscular Dystrophy And does a lot of work with them on a volunteer basis 
 but it's almost like a job 
 she just doesn't get paid for it
 Yeah 
 when your wife has her baby is she going to stay home 
 or is she going to go back to work
 that 
 I would like to be able to do that
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I see a difference in even the generation before me were you know mom was like you know June Cleaver or whatever 
 where the attitudes were a lot different 
 as far as I think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more 
 there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and a lot of the things that are going on in today's society 
 I think morally it seems like people were a lot better back then as far as higher standards
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's true
 And I think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I think that in the future the family unit as it once was known is going to be nonexistent <> 
 what do you think 
 That as far as 
 do you think there's going to be still a family unit 
 or do you think that the trend is going more towards single parenting
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that eventually the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore 
 like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that I think there's going to be more single parent families than there are you know two parent families
 That's pretty sad
 I think in the long run though your child will benefit from that
 And it will make the strain worthwhile
 Well I need to go ahead and wrap it up
 it was really nice talking to you
 And thanks a lot
 Okay 
 bye-bye
