 No 
 I'm not in the middle of anything 
 I've just 
 about the last thing I did 
 about maybe close to a year ago now I guess I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house 
 So I guess that 
 Yeah 
 that was fairly large undertaking 
 it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house
 we did it all except for the sheetrocking
 That was the only thing we didn't you know putting the ceiling up and things like that 
 we weren't sure how to do that 
 and 
 Yeah 
 that's the exact opposite 
 We put the roof up and did all the roofing and put all the interior walls up 
 We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work 
 and that's it because you have you know get those joints to go together
 and whatever you have to put in there to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that 
 we didn't know a thing about any of that 
 and so 
 it looked very hard to do 
 so 
 we figured well just 
 I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional 
 So we left it to somebody who does it for a living 
 But 
 Probably so 
 and we'd never done it 
 so we just left it alone 
 But that's 
 I guess I'm only twenty-one 
 so my vast experience of home owner's knowledge is not very much 
 So it's just what I have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents 
 so 
 It was brand new
 We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house 
 so it was 
 well my dad knew how to do most of it you know 
 we'd gotten a couple of books 
 and then he just started doing it 
 I don't know 
 well he did all the flooring himself 
 He put the whole floor in 
 and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there 
 And then we put like a not necessarily a garage but just like a off the side of that 
 after we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less 
 you know it's not enclosed 
 It's just somewhere to drive another car to park 
 and it's 
 it's off the ground
 Uh-huh 
 It's on about twenty-two inch piers something like that
 So 
 no 
 those are 
 we did those ourselves 
 so 
 Yeah
 Exactly 
 so It's 
 Yeah 
 those are 
 I've done one 
 I helped somebody do one of those before 
 those are you know 
 you can buy them in kits 
 but we didn't do that way 
 But it's 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 That's not near like building a house or anything 
 but 
 Yeah 
 those are nice 
 Especially when you get done you've got something you know 
 I don't know 
 I like them 
 You just sit down on the deck and do whatever Have a barbecue 
 or 
 Yeah 
 that sounds nice
 All done by yourself 
 Designed 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's a good size deck
 So yeah 
 That's 
 Yeah 
 That's not 
 Yeah 
 that's good 
 That's not bad at all 
 Didn't have to 
 the wood may 
 it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is you know 
 to get good lumber it costs 
 I don't know about Dallas but even in this little town it's not cheap at all 
 I was surprised
 It's probably more there 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it probably does 
 I'm not sure 
 but 
 Yeah 
 It's nothing but woods down here 
 Yeah
 I mean I haven't 
 I used to live in Dallas In Arlington actually
 but that was just when I was a kid 
 so I don't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore 
 But I don't know we're a college town 
 so that doesn't help us out any
 We have 
 gas is a dollar twelve a gallon 
 so that's probably about what you're paying 
 so 
 Yeah
 You've got something going all the time
