 Great 
 currently I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program
 I'm mainly do a lot of walking 
 I have a son that's a little bit overweight 
 and the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around 
 So my wife and I kind of take turns 
 At one time I had a fairly regular exercise program 
 But in the last couple of months I've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down 
 All this space that normally would be dedicated towards the exercise area is covered in boxes
 Well I had a little routine that I did for warm ups
 And then I did some very mild say light weight lifting 
 Nothing 
 I'm not trying to make big bulging muscles just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age 
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Yeah 
 That's a plus 
 I have a total of five children 
 I have three left living at home
 And they do take up a big part of my evening and weekend
 And it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself too
 It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up 
 Yes 
 when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children
 Yeah
 You have to 
 what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself
 And you can use what ever rationale you want 
 but basically the healthier you stay the longer you'll live
 And you know if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then I'll around a lot longer
 And those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now well you know get the enjoyment of me years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have taken it
 If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 I've done a lot of study over the years 
 and I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water
 Yeah 
 the research that I've done 
 and I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three
 And it's amazing that you know prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks
 There were none prior to nineteen-hundred 
 Well in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water In nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities 
 and after that we started having the hearts attacks 
 and Dr Price wrote a book CORONARY CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE 
 You can usually find it in a health food store
 I know they had it in health food stores in Plano 
 I used live in Plano
 Dr Price 
 yeah 
 And it's amazing 
 he makes the 
 you know it's a very small book 
 and the guys very opinionated 
 but he makes a very good case against chlorine 
 There were no heart attacks before we started using it 
 and he points out that people in England 
 or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now
 and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks
 Yeah 
 He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours And proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the clogging of the arteries 
 And you know he's 
 there's been a lot of reports since then 
 This whole thing about 
 first it was stress then it went to cholesterol 
 and now they're saying what's cholesterol 
 well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol
 You know it's amazing what he points out in that book 
 and in fact everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency who did work back in nineteen eighty-six who wrote a letter to Dr Price in nineteen eighty-seven And in this letter he praised Dr Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis 
 And E P A never published that report
 CORONARY CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 there is a lot of good information out there about health 
 And a lot of the myths they've been passing around people are starting to realize aren't true
 I mean I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because that's good for you
 but to believe some of the things 
 you know and I don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet 
 but to think that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is just hard to believe
 Huh-uh
 Yeah 
 I actually eat pretty much anything that I want
 And I've had my cholesterol checked a few times 
 and I've never been above like you know one-hundred and fifty never 
 And I mean I 
 Well what they tell me 
 but I mean you know everything is like within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing 
 You know they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued
 But we've 
 I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley Maryland
 Yeah 
 and we've had a few of the health fairs up here 
 and you know I've always come out aces
 You know I'm not really that big on watching what I eat 
 but I do eat you know some health cookies that are high in fiber low in fat and all that kind of stuff 
 But I mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine I'm not worried about it <>
