 I work at T I 
 and we have of course started random drug testing here 
 and I haven't gotten called yet 
 but I feel that it's pretty good if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs
 I think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at T I 
 but I think our latest statistic said something like ninety-nine point nine eight percent were testing negative on all the testing 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Right 
 I 
 at T I if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then you're put on a program 
 and you know you go through the program 
 and then you're called like six months after you complete the program 
 and if you test positive then you're terminated
 Yeah 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Uh-huh 
 and of course they can also cause injury to other people
 if they're not you know fully functional mentally while they're doing their job They could cause you know serious injury to another people 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 So 
 Right 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yes 
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 Uh-huh
 You know I think personally I'm for it 
 There's several reason why I could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing 
 they say runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it
 And 
 Yes 
 And yeah 
 it's very expensive
 And 
 Uh-huh
 It's not like a normal urinalysis
 it's very expensive to run them 
 And I didn't get a raise this year 
 because nobody in our company got a raise
 But yet they spend all the money on drug testing 
 and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise 
 So see you know there's different 
 I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a yes sir we should have drug testing because there's really a problem 
 and I know that 
 But then I have other views to it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Their's might not run a thousand dollars 
 *[[Their's> Theirs]] Our 
 from what I understanding here at T I they run close to a thousand dollars an employee
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 But no 
 for all the pub- 
 it's
