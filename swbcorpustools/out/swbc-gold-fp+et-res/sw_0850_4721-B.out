 Well no 
 I don't get as much exercise as I should as or as I would like to these days 
 I 
 seems to be to easy to get busy with other things 
 I have in the past jogged and and run 
 and every January and every September I start out again 
 and then it tapers off 
 what about you
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Well now that's related to the aerobic 
 Okay
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well okay 
 Now that's inside again 
 right
 But 
 do you like to do it with other people 
 I mean like the jazzercise would be 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 But 
 Yeah 
 right 
 Right 
 But still there are other people there doing the same thing 
 In terms of motivation and incentive 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that makes a difference doesn't it
 I've 
 one thing 
 when I have run and jogged 
 I've always enjoyed doing it by myself 
 and kno- 
 not with the sense that it was chore or something that I was having to do 
 I've really enjoyed just the activity 
 and I write software as far as the job 
 and so getting out and being active helps out 
 The th- 
 it's 
 the change of pace and just getting out and around 
 and I find that I can often you know 
 often when I get around to doing it then I feel better when I get back to work 
 and also that my subconscious is working on things while I'm working 
 and I go back 
 and I've got new ideas 
 but still 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that's a good term demanding the time for yourself 
 That you've just got to prior- 
 Right 
 Yeah
 Well good 
 well good 
 Well have you done any jogging 
 I tell you you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in the club 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
