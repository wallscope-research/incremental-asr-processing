 I've originated only a few
 But I've received quite a few
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I've been getting mine
 you pushed the record button 
 We're supposed to be discussing the subject
 Yeah 
 well I'll tell you 
 I've been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies 
 and it's hard to beat any of the benefits or salaries either that we get from T I 
 I'm quite pleased with it 
 Course there's a few things that I think I could do better if I was sitting up in the C E O's seat 
 but I think Jerry's doing a pretty good job as it goes
 Uh-huh
 Well 
 yes
 Uh-huh 
 Well like I say I worked for several different companies 
 and there's nothing to compare with T I here
 Now I really got caught up back in eighty-five 
 I got caught up in the oil layoff 
 I wasn't with G S I but I was connected with oil exploration 
 No 
 with T I
 But I say I wasn't connected with G S I
 And I got caught up in a layoff
 Now course you get six months unemployment from the State
 but what T I did for us is I've never heard of it before They fixed us up with an office with telephones access to long-distance computers a secretary to take messages for us or type letters for us 
 they had out of town newspapers 
 and then 
 I beg your pardon
 yes 
 They did have seminars every once in a while
 course that was not restricted just to just us
 But the most important thing was that they had made up the difference between unemployment pay and seventy-five percent of my net pay 
 And they then 
 T I paid me that
 So I was able to not just exist 
 I mean I lived just as comfortably as I did before I was laid off
 Uh-huh
 Well this was not a learning thing by any means 
 It was just an assistance trying to find another job
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 Well course I went through this what about five years ago 
 They may have improved it considerably
 Well that's one of those little extras that you don't see in the handbook you know
 It 
 Well now I have 
 I'm getting close to retirement
 And of course I've been looking into it but since I'm only a yellow badger I won't be getting a whole heck of a lot from T I as far as retirement is concerned
 I've never heard of such a thing
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 I 
 that sounds like a hell of an idea 
 I didn't know there was such a thing 
 Yes 
 by all means 
 Well what would be the difference between that and social security
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 No 
 I like the idea
 Course that's something like an I R A
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that's what I've done 
 I've bounced around 
 About every ten years I change
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well knock wood 
 I haven't used mine for anything major Just doctor visits 
 and well I have the H O M A 
 I use H O M A
 And I like that a lot better than AETNA
 Uh-huh 
 Well doesn't it work you don't see anything until you spend the minimum
 Don't you have to spend the minimum of two three hundred
 Yeah 
 Well now I have the same dental you have
 Uh-huh 
 Now see I don't have a deductible
 I pay a straight five dollars for anything a doctor visit or drugs 
 that one I haven't heard about
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I have high blood pressure problems myself
 Yeah 
 thirty days at a time
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 great 
 Yeah 
 I just might do that
 Well thanks
 thanks for the tip Jim 
 I shall look into it
 Yeah 
 let's see 
 we discussed medical and dental
 retirement 
 Uh-huh
 What about vacation
 yeah 
 that's right
 Uh-huh
 Well I'm here 
 I've got just eleven years 
 and I don't think I'll ever see a silver badge
 I won't be around that long
