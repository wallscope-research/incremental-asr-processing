 so you have children I take it
 You don't
 So it's not a very valid topic
 yes
 One
 Stepdaughter
 Ten
 And you know how they are at that age I guess you having been ten once yourself
 we have one
 A Keeshonden
 Yeah
 fuzzy little thing
 A fuzzy little dog
 rather odd personality 
 he's fun
 Anyway time we spend with our children
 <> It seems almost as though children hate it
 Yes
 Time spent with Mom and Dad is probably one of the worst punishments spent on earth to them
 Yeah
 They you know 
 parents are a curse that they just have to live with
 So it's interesting
 But we do spend time driving in the mountains 
 and 
 Well 
 Do you work for T I 
 You're working then
 With every passing day we wonder if we will be
 it's better to be employed
 Especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner
 And that creates family tensions
 Yes
 No 
 no
 I don't have any children
 well it varies what it is of course 
 but usually Mom and Dad are a curse
 You know they'd much rather be with friends
 friends are cool parents aren't
 Well I remember 
 well I'm sure part of it is a male female thing you know
 I remember whenever I was growing up often times spent with my Dad was just wonderful you know go hunting or go to the races or any number of things
 And we'd have great times
 and it seems that well now the bank's not available
 <> And entirely too much time is spent 
 my wife and I were wondering what if
 <> and what if's always rough
 But you know we do have our trips 
 and we do have our fun 
 and I don't know little girls aren't interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were
 Hunting and Looking for arrowheads and 
 but they don't like it
 there is a difference there
 and 
 Well girls at that age Video games boys and malls
 Not necessarily in that order and friends of course
 And that's a little tough for fathers
 Fathers don't even like malls 
 they despise shopping
 So is that quality time
 Yeah 
 if 
 but there is camping 
 and we both enjoy that
 Somewhat yeah 
 yeah 
 Getting up in the mountains and getting away from it all 
 and that's somewhat fun
 It's 
 so what do you think about child rearing 
 Is 
 how would you spend time with kids
 yeah
 Yeah 
 but 
 Well yeah 
 and amazingly a lot of times it's real easy
 You know a lot of times whenever we head out of town on a trip or something it's real easy to swing in there for breakfast
 Breakfast and run
 And breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway
 and kids eat funny
 And little girls are worse about it than little boys
 They 
 or something yeah
 Go on a diet or they have a well 
 to some extent the public schools or the schools in general influence them the eating meat kick
 You know like it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something I'm not sure
 Of course that's not the way I was raised being raised in West Texas
 yeah
 Born in Denton raised in Lubbock
 So I understand about bass
 but it is interesting
 I will tell you 
 yeah 
 Every person out there should have kids at least once or have some they can borrow for a time because everyone needs some torture in their lives
 But Jenny is a sweet kid
 And yeah 
 we do do things
 and it's funny 
 it's almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children to go do
 The money's not available
 You know we were talking about how much it cost to go to Disney Land
 Golly 
 A couple 
 three hundred dollars
 You know for just you know a day or two not including lodging and food and all that
 It's 
 I don't see how anyone can afford it
 And I understand Six Flags is real expensive now
 yeah
 Twenty bucks a whack now
 But at least once you pay your way in there at Six Flags 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 food and junk to carry out
 So that's not as bad
 But golly
 You know Disney World or Disney Land
 Well our problem is that you know a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or Disney Land or God forbid Disney World would take forever
 Or you'd have to pay air fare
 and ooh you know for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick
 Rent a car when you get there and all that 
 Yeah
