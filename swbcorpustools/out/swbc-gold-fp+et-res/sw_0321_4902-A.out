 And you say you have some strong feelings about the issue
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well I'm a little bit ambivalent 
 and I think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it in terms of what really is driving it 
 They're not willing to tell the truth The same way with issues of race and things like that 
 I mean right now I believe there are two policies that the government uses to modulate immigration Three actually 
 One is at the high end 
 they always want to be able to do some brain draining 
 They always like to be able to attract the Einsteins or the Professor Chou 
 or you know 
 They'd like to be able to get the top people in any field 
 and so they can almost always find room for someone like that 
 At the bottom end they are always willing to let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area 
 Those are two things that I think are going on Although I don't think the politicians would tell you that
 And then the third thing is the political aspect of letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico 
 They cannot close off the Mexican border Not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would spill over to this country 
 so they keep allowing the pressure cooker to let off steam
 that's one of the few things I guess I found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan 
 I think they're a very difficult group to integrate into society 
 They're very difficult group to find jobs and places for 
 And so I don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem in that they're pretty miserable where they are 
 But I'm not to sympathetic about letting large numbers of Haitians in
 Yeah
 Right 
 But yeah If you let them in a million at a time you know it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population But politically and economically 
 Yeah 
 well I know about it 
 I mean it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans twenty years ago 
 On the other hand you know the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than our first generation immigrant 
 So there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in
 Right 
 Sure
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
