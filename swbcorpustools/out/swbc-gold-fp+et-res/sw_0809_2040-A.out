 Yes 
 I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for Puerto Rico
 Well I guess I don't have such close experience with an area becoming a state as you do 
 my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low standard of living or at least annual average income
 part of this I suppose is justified in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need
 However in that case I guess I would favor status quo 
 I have been to Puerto Rico and found it very very interesting 
 I did Peace Corps training there
 And so you know I saw it also as a young student 
 and it was very foreign in a certain sense although I had grown up in California 
 and so the Spanish was no problem 
 it was you know very lovely 
 and the people seemed very friendly and nice 
 I have 
 actually I work with a girl from Puerto Rico 
 and I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors 
 Well probably more in terms of the U S 
 you know I'm not quite sure how the U S copes with this sort of thing 
 I've live abroad most of my life 
 so I guess I've been very cut off 
 I lived actually in Lebanon 
 so I was very cut off from the press as I you know was becoming an adult
 So I don't know how the U S would cope with a new state that is so very very poor
 I guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if you consider the inner cities of like New York and how much aid it needs 
 I suppose or the whole new state would require such aid
 I think so
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 those are good points which obviously I had never thought about 
 I don't know I suppose they also not being a state are probably freer to determine their own ways of life than they would if 
 I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory
 Perhaps compulsory education and taxes 
 Uh-huh 
 Well well actually I thin- 
 one one thing that I remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language which I always assumed it was anyway 
 So if they've just taken such action it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish or Hispanic heritage
 I believe I would probably tend towards that
 Well that's interesting
 Right 
 What about if they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 That's interesting because although I tend to be bilingual Spanish based on experience I was in bilingual education in California 
 and I didn't have any problem with my students/
 but I noticed my brother who was quite a bit younger was learning Spanish in elementary school
 and he can't speak a word
 And so obviously it didn't work in California
 Right
 Right
 I see
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Okay 
 well thank you very much
 Bye 
 bye
