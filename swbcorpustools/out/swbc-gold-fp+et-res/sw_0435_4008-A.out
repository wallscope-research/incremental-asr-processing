 do you have a P C
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 a lot of my friends are into Macintoshes 
 I have a I B M P C myself
 A two eighty-six 
 I'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six 
 mostly word processing applications and just as a dumb terminal
 but I think eventually I'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that 
 what do you find that you use yours mostly for
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I think I'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty-six before I move up to windows although you know I do like the graphical user environment
 Yeah 
 it's 
 I just want it more for multi tasking which I suppose is also like a Macintosh
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's what I learned a lot of languages on was an Apple two E in my high school
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well do you use your computer for just things around the house or in the 
 Well see what do you do
 wow 
 and do these programs 
 are they based on a other language 
 or are they based 
 like you know a lot of the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world 
 and the teacher just tries to teach English you know through natural understanding
 Uh-huh
 Well it was just when I was high school I worked for the community school 
 and they had a English second language class 
 and it always seemed strange to me that you know all these people that you know spoke English not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time
 I imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you know you don't have as many cues 
 you don't have hand gestures and things like that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I would imagine so 
 so what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E
 Uh-huh 
 it's 
 Yes 
 it's amazing you know how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much 
 I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it
 and you know then I started playing with Apples you know 
 and those had forty-eight 
 or you know if they were really great they had sixty-four K
 I know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them is all 
 and 
 I remember that there was one game that I played that required forty-eight K 
 and there was only one computer that had forty-eight K on it at the time
 And you know it's just so amazing that generally you know if you 
 I'm not sure about Macintoshes 
 but I know I B Ms you know you buy a megabyte at a time
 You know that's the low end 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I imagine
