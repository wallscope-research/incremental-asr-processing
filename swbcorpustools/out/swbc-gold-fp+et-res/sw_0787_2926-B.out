 Uh-huh 
 what do you think about the lower grades you know K through seven 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yep 
 I 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I just read some things recently where graduate programs in general basically they're fifty per cent foreign 
 Yeah 
 just about f- 
 yeah 
 but when you consider especially in technical areas science engineering and computers 
 Yeah 
 especially in those areas it's almost fifty per cent foreign like forty-eight per cent 
 and that involves both Canadian and European Middle Eastern and Far Eastern 
 yeah
 I think I have similar views 
 that's you know where our elementary grades 
 it's amazing 
 I have a friend who's an elementary school teacher
 and she said that they have to pat the kids down because they bring guns to school 
 She teaches in the city of Baltimore 
 and that 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 and it's really 
 you know kids can't read 
 it's really 
 they 
 you know by the time they 
 my wife teaches middle school
 Yeah 
 and they can't 
 yeah 
 by the time they get there they can't read 
 they can't read anything
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think it's probably the work that your children are doing 
 she can tell you know when they have kids come in for 
 they meet with all of the parents
 and she can tell before a parent comes in normally you know give or take eighty ninety per cent you know what the parents are going to be like when they come in and the responses the parents will give back 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I think it's probably very true
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 But you know surprisingly because you put such a commitment on education your children probably could have gone to schools with a higher student teacher ratio and still done well because when they would come home you and your wife would say you know what did you do today
 let's sit down and read together
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's parental 
 Yep 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 But you know what's really funny is that there's been some research because I'm a college professor and a lot of the research shows that like while Hewing was playing at Georgetown basketball Georgetown and they were winning endowment to the university in other words money that could to everything everything and normally gets directed away from sports realistically a lot of the was was probably two-thirds I guess it's now two-thirds of what it was when they were national champions 
 In other words while they're national champions people donate more money
 Average human beings like you and I average Joes that make a decent salary that are a graduate of the school send big bucks like couple hundreds of dollars 
 but thousands of people 
 Because no 
 normally it's because of the sports
 Right 
 right 
 but see the sports brings in the money
 Because when Georgetown was number one their money that was donated to them from companies from business people from graduates whatever was up into you know like twenty million dollars 
 and now it's down to like fourteen million 
 During that time period in other words their alumni giving and other funds have slowly dropped since then
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's 
 yeah 
 it's amazing the way 
 but now that's big time
 Yeah 
 but smaller schools aren't like that 
 only the big time schools show that
 But you're right 
 I think the emphasis on sports 
 and as a 
 see I'm a former athlete in a sense 
 I swam 
 but swimming never gets much glory so it really doesn't matter 
 But 
 That's true 
 that's true 
 but you know they still 
 He didn't make it 
 no
 I would have liked it if he would have though
 but I think realistically you know you read the research studies 
 and I don't think he would have made it simply because the event he was trying to swim the research shows that distance running so I would assume distance swimming might be similar that 
 and he was good at distance Spitz as a swimmer you know 
 at 
 I can remember that 
 but the distance strength and endurance or whatever sort of starts to peak at about twenty-eight twenty-nine thirty 
 That's why some of your long distance runners were in their early thirties
 and but he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event
 and most of them are under twenty-five
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 you're kidding
 Jeez
 Huh 
 And that 
 as an athlete I just hate that 
 Go head 
 yeah 
 what were you saying 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 I think in some sense what I would do before I would extend a school year is I would make it better Before I would continue the agony
 and something you have to consider too because I know as a former high school teacher I know that from right now
