 Okay 
 well I guess I enjoy eating out here and there 
 or it's a good change from cooking and eating at home 
 and I guess I like a variety of restaurants
 sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal 
 and sometimes I enjoy going out having a formal meal
 And sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad
 Something you know 
 Well a variety 
 I like to go sometimes without them 
 and sometimes it's okay to take them along 
 So 
 Sometimes I think we pay the baby-sitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches 
 so you know it just varies 
 we do a mix 
 Sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband 
 and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was just to you know have a moment of peace and quiet without little ones at the table
 So I guess actually there are times I even say please don't sit us next to a table with other children
 this is our night out 
 but anyway where do you like to eat
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 which one do you like
 okay 
 Well it's been a long time since we've been in there 
 but it's good 
 There's an Italian restaurant over by Plano Parkway there 
 pas- <> 
 is it Campari's or something
 Well it's good 
 my husband had been in there several times 
 and actually we went in there for lunch one day
 And their pastas were great
 You're brave 
 God 
 Right
 No 
 I don't think so 
 well Even though traditional it can backfire
 well my husband's he's the ethnic fan 
 So he's 
 I don't know 
 You know what we read the D MAGAZINE
 we check that and the Friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there 
 They often do ratings of restaurants 
 so 
 we often save those and ventured out on from there just for something that had a high rating
 Okay
 That's right
 good 
 good 
 yeah 
 we use the coupons too 
 That's true 
 That's true
 right 
 Right
 Well I think that's ex- 
 sometimes I think going out to eat it's sort of a recreation
 So just a change of pace from eating at home 
 So anyway I guess as far as service when we go out it's nice to have someone come and wait the table And clear the table and 
 Yeah 
 and do the dishes 
 And actually it's kind of nice to you know 
 I always 
 a waitress or waiter that waits the table it's nice that they're attentive
 but it's not nice when they're too attentive
 So we've had experience with that too 
 So 
 yeah 
 Well how we 
 it may help their tip may not 
 I guess just in Plano I like to go to Souper Salads
 Chili's is always fine
 I guess if we go into Dallas we like the is it Routh Street Cafe
 well you would like it
 You'd like it especially it you're adventuresome
 we've taken people there several times 
 and they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding 
 I guess it's whether you call it Southwestern 
 but we had venison chili one time Which was absolutely wonderful 
 And then I guess it must be seasonal 
 and we've been back 
 I guess it's in the winter season 
 well they've never had it when we've been back 
 But well you ought to try that 
 it's very good 
 No 
 that's good 
 Yes 
 I've been there
