 We're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done with it
 They're usually pretty broad anyway
 Where do you live
 Okay 
 so that's a 
 I'm in Richardson 
 so when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing down at Maceo High School in Dallas
 It is you know
 No 
 mine are already in college now 
 so I don't have to 
 at least when they were in high school it was beginning but not like the rampages
 That's true
 Yeah 
 well I just don't understand of course in my little world how guns could be so available
 my heavens
 Well maybe that's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution
 You know because I don't 
 now somehow I feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen you know across the street or seeing someone get mugged or unfortunately raped 
 and people don't do anything
 A woman was raped in Richardson I read in the paper about a two weeks ago now 
 And all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help
 But nobody did anything
 You know I mean they heard someone calling for help 
 Nobody even called the police to say you know I hear a strange screaming
 I'm afraid you know if you 
 I don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves
 Yeah
 I just you know 
 it's really frightening that we're trying to live in our own little cocoons 
 and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 well you know the call for help is what scares me now because it just 
 I don't know 
 people just don't 
 I don't know 
 I can't say they don't care because people just have to care about another person
 But it's that not getting involved that impersonal society I think we live in today
 Yeah <>
 Let me ask you 
 getting back to your son's football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police aren't doing 
 he didn't have a license for the gun correct
 Uh-huh
