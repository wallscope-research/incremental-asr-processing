 Okay
 H- 
 No 
 we don't although we enjoy it 
 we do it more when we have company come 
 what about you
 I've heard of that 
 but I haven't been there 
 where about is that
 okay 
 I've been to Cafe Pacific
 Right
 Yes 
 
 Before we moved to the area my brother lived in Dallas for a number of years 
 and we came up one time when my father was visiting 
 and we all ate there 
 and their seafood was wonderful
 Now where is the Atlantic Cafe
 okay
 No 
 but I've heard that's really good too 
 and 
 Oh
 Oh
 okay
 Uh-huh
 You know right away what you want 
 Well we really enjoy prime rib too 
 and actually the Steak And Ale out here we've gone to 
 my in-laws also enjoy prime rib when they've had some of their specials on Sunday Monday or Tuesday night 
 and the time we went the prime rib was really good
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah <>
 I've heard about that too 
 but no 
 I guess we eat out even less than I realize 
 Oh <>
 Yeah 
 Yes 
 I had heard that too 
 Have you been to the little not for prime rib but the Cafe De France right here on Central Expressway *[[slash error]] okay
 *[[slash error should be bk]] Yes 
 primarily lunch well and breakfast sometimes 
 but during the week they often have a limited menu choice but very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety-nine that included the soup or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert 
 and the 
 my husband and I like veal a lot 
 and their veal dishes have been good 
 We've tried different ones when they've had them as one of the 
 Uh-huh
 
 I 
 yes 
 no 
 Right 
 And 
 I haven't either 
 one place 
 and I've only been there for lunch 
 but I went with a friend 
 and we met her husband down on Greenville 
 down near the Highway Twelve area is Gershwin's
 we just we- 
 It was 
 and we both enjoy mushroom soup 
 and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup 
 and they did 
 It was wonderful 
 and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert which was a chocolate sack 
 I don't know if you tried 
 or s- 
 Yes 
 [ It + yes *[[Shouldn't this end in a slash ]] it ] had a sponge cake *[[ I really think this should be the start of a new slash unit ]] and whip cream 
 and it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry puree 
 and we shared one the three of us 
 and it was plenty because it was very rich 
 but I wished I'd had a camera 
 It was beautiful 
 <>
 Oh
 Oh
 Yes 
 Yeah <>
 Oh
 It sounds wonderful
 Well that's one of the things that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant 
 I love fresh berries 
 And their fruits are always exceptional 
 know 
 they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market you can't find them like that 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 I would too 
 well because we don't go out very often 
 When we do go out in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess 
 and it's a whole experience 
 Of course you want the food to be good 
 but the atmosphere and service I think are important too
 Yeah 
 that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track 
 but it is wonderful 
 It's called Cafe Max 
 and it's at Plano Road and Campbell 
 They have the most wonderful salads 
 They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three
