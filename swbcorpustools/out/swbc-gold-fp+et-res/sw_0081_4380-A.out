 Recently graduated from high school Meaning like you know three or four years ago 
 I'm a senior in college now
 And I can't really talk too much about the problems with public education in detail because the school system I went to was really superb even though it was a public school system
 Oh 
 Okay
 Yeah
 I got a friend who goes there by the way 
 I want to talk to you about that afterward 
 okay 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's a more or less a suburban school system
 Yes 
 that was true for mine too 
 although I I'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity
 but I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it 
 You know I mean I know that in my town you know most of the parents they're valued education 
 you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn 
 I mean you know 
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 but I think I mean even more than that even I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know Which I mean it sounds like 
 now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because they have these sort of <>tory tests you have to take before you get a diploma 
 but certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read 
 and that's just sort of inexcusable 
 and you can't really 
 I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen You know except maybe to someone whose you know really badly learning disabled or something 
 But these people obviously weren't
 <> Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 And I think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably 
 I mean I think you know people just 
 Yeah 
 And again I don't I mean 
 they got to know you know how qualified I mean 
 I think it'd be interesting you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school you know sort of maybe from elementary through high school You know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like
 I think that'd be an interesting experience 
 But I haven't done that 
 But I do think that I mean public education in general I think can work 
 And I think it's a good thing
 Yeah
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I mean I honestly don't really think I could have you know done much better than I did in the school system I was in I mean
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I mean and in the 
 once you start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels 
 Well no 
 I guess in junior high it was still three 
 Then in high school it changed into four levels of instruction in the major subjects which 
 I mean actually I think that works pretty well 
 and that makes
