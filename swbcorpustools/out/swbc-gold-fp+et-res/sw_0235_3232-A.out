 Okay 
 I guess our topic is advice about going to college
 Do you have children of your own
 are you
 What school are you going to
 Are you enjoying it
 Are you working on your Bachelor's degree
 And what field of study are you in
 Uh-huh
 well that's neat 
 Are you from North Carolina
 are you really
 Well what took you to North Carolina
 I see
 Well that was one of the things I was thinking about in school 
 I went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock and I had a friend my roommate went to Tech also 
 but she was from New Mexico
 and she had to pay out of state tuition
 and I think that would have played a real big part of my decision
 yeah because she was pay- 
 of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now 
 It was like four dollars a semester hour
 and so I was going to school for you know just a few hundred dollars a semester 
 and she was paying forty dollars an hour
 so she paid ten times as much because she was out of state
 that's good 
 Yeah 
 so I think that would be one thing I would definitely consider try to find a school within the state that I liked well enough to attend
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 right
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 that was something else I had was I had government aid of course 
 but it was wonderful because I got one of those grants that you don't have to repay
 and yeah 
 it was so nice
 it paid most of my tuition and a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing 
 so 
 Yeah 
 I really 
 I'm sorry what did you say
 Well it was called a B E O G a Basic Equal Opportunity Grant
 and it was from the government 
 and at first it was based on my parents' income 
 My parents had five children and really didn't make enough money to send any of us to school
 And so because based on the number of children and the amount of money my father brought in I got a small grant
 but then after that I was on my own working and you know trying to go to school on my own 
 So then I got a real big grant because the amount of money I was making really didn't compare 
 So it was kind of nice
 I don't know if those are still available or not 
 but 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 this was great 
 it was just based on you know how much your tuition costs and everything 
 and generally it paid everything 
 so I went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing 
 so that was 
 Yeah 
 it was really nice
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 I didn't know that
 Well I guess the only comparison I had ever heard was between a Christian college because I thought about attending Abilene Christian instead of Texas Tech
 and of course the price was just astronomical compared to Tech
 the Christian college was so much more expensive 
 But I guess some of the other smaller colleges might be a lot different
 Really
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 you're just a number
 Right
 Yeah
 that's a shame 
 Well I felt a little cheated at Tech also 
 Once I got into my 
 I majored in
