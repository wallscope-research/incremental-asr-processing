 Okay 
 Well anyways I'm not exactly sure 
 I wasn't really paying attention as to what particular parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about 
 but it was basically what's your views on whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used that sort of thing
 Right 
 And I don't know 
 I've always thought that any crime that intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life would be the ones where I think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps doing it again and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that you know there's a very steep penalty to be paid when that's done 
 and Yeah 
 how do you feel about it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 exactly
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 if the evidence wasn't overwhelming right
 Uh-huh
 Well I think that should be likewise decided by the jury you know because I don't know I think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for any reason
 I don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it
 Yeah 
 I don't think we 
 No 
 huh-uh 
 No 
 we don't
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 they're always in Florida 
 Florida and Louisiana I think and some of the other southern states
 Course they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment rate
 Get that unemployment way up 
 so then people you know tend towards crime 
 and then they start stiffening the penalties
 Well in Florida seems like two or three times a year 
 It's constantly on the 
 Yeah 
 No 
 that's true 
 Course they have a requirement that every single appeal must be permitted
 So of course the attorneys take them through the whole chain You know even if the case is open and closed 
 they go all the way up to the Supreme Court you know
 They almost always get thrown right back out again 
 but they have to have every single appeal made open to them 
 And you know it's sort of strange because <> it almost seems like the attorneys are doing it for the money or something because I mean the guy knows that whether it's you know a month or two or six years he's still going to get you know the chair when it comes around You know
 Some of these guys are really you know violent Son of Sam killers and stuff like that you know
 I mean they 
 everyone knows they're not going to get out
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I think so
 a lot of the other violent crimes I don't really feel that strongly about 
 Although you know stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole 
 I mean these guys are certainly not going to be 
 they can't 
 I mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison 
 I don't think the parole system is really helping that much 
 Reduce the violence in the prisons 
 I think that's its only purpose is you know to reduce the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get Off earlier 
 But some of these guys just don't care {D you know 
 } And so 
 Yeah 
 right 
 uh-huh
 that's possible I guess
 so where do you live in Pennsylvania
 okay 
 I don't think I really know that
 Because you know 
 that all depends too on where you are at 
 That's sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are Because the more grass root parts of the country tend to support capital punishment where the places that are you know less in contact with crime you know the more urban I mean less 
 Uh-huh
 Two hours where
 okay 
 Near Polk
 Polk Institute 
 It's an old university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded 
 Very old historical place there
 Sharon Pennsylvania's up there
 Yeah
 okay
 In that case maybe you know
 Right 
 That's true 
 Yeah 
 well it you know 
 you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have you know stolen kids and you know done terrible things to them and killed them and you know that sort of thing 
 you just 
 like I don't want that person sharing the Earth with me you know 
 I mean that is just terrible
 And you know we had a case like that here 
 and on the other hand you know people are saying that because the criminals know that the penalties can be very severe 
 they 
 there's less criminals that are you know turning themselves in or you know pleading or whatever because they know that the judge you know if they find them guilty you know has the opportunity to sentence them you know for the death sentence
 Yeah
 Well I'm just saying that that's what the client lawyers are saying 
 They're saying that you know you know more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be
 You can plea bargain what you're guilty of you know But not how they're going to sentence you 
 Right 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 right
 Uh-huh 
 I was just saying that way 
 what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then 
 And so we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty
 And perhaps we can 
 and perhaps we can't 
 and so the guy might get off
 And although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are guys that are you know going to get caught anyways 
 but 
 There's always a few of those people that you know lost their head or whatever
 Anyways but Yeah 
 we just had a terrible case in Virginia where some girl disappeared 
 and the guy like I said he just said that he took her 
 but he won't admit that she died or whatever 
 and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's you know mandatory life sentences for murder
