 There we are
 Well I have a Honda hatchback nineteen eighty-four
 And I had a hatchback a nineteen seventy-eight version before this one
 And I'll be honest with you 
 I have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and put together 
 and it does its job 
 All I have to do on my Honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty-five hundred miles 
 and I did have to put two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles 
 but that car just purrs like the day it was built 
 I get forty-two miles per gallon on the highway and twenty-eight to thirty driving around in town 
 It's a five speed straight stick machine
 And I can carry more in that trunk area in my little Honda than I can in the big cars 
 and I have a large Pontiac 
 and I have a sixty-nine Cougar which I'm saving because it's old 
 but it's in beautiful shape
 But I can carry as much in my Honda or more than I can in those other bigger cars
 
 L X
 It was an L X
 Uh-huh 
 yours is a four door
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yes 
 they are
 uh-huh
 Ninety-five is wild in any car 
 There's no doubt about that
 because I run over to Crystal City or used to 
 I'm retiring the end of this month
 but I'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 it just sits there and purrs 
 and all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter 
 I get six hundred miles on a tank of gas
 Yeah
 Beautiful beautiful machine
 Is that right 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well a brand new Volvo costs what thirty thousand dollars
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well my eighty-four just has seventy-seven on it
 and I've made many trips to Washington and down to Virginia Beach Virginia where my mother lives and things like that 
 and I drive it
