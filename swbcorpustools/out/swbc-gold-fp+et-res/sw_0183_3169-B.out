 about the only memories that I have of boating 
 my husband's family had a motor boat when we got engaged 
 and they took us out on the lake several times 
 And I really did enjoy that 
 I don't know that I ever learned to drive it or anything 
 but we did some water skiing of course and driving around the lake in the boat and just the basic safety rules and things I found real interesting you know 
 they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever 
 the laws were there 
 and if you didn't obey them you know there were a lot of accidents I guess
 But I found the motor boating was real fun
 Oh 
 That sounds like a real challenge
 Uh-huh
 Well my son
