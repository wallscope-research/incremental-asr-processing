 Okay 
 cars 
 you 
 maybe this is a fantasy we can to talk about any kind of car we want here 
 I want a Rolls Royce and a Cadillac 
 that's great 
 I'm a hobbyist too 
 I like to work on cars too
 that's good
 Was you 
 why they didn't 
 say buy it 
 they didn't necessarily say buy it new they just said what would you buy you know
 sure
 a restored vehicle is great I think certainly if it's an old Mercedes will be good
 Well that's great
 yeah 
 you all done a lot more 
 when I talk about working on cars I sure don't do that
 okay
 that is good acknowledgeable people
 That's amazing
 I do all my own work 
 so I have Chevies mostly 
 well that's all I've got right now
 I've got three Chevy V Eights 
 I'm an American car person
 but I do like Mercedes
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well I'm not a Ford person and never have been as a kid
 and I do like the V Eight engines 
 and I think the 
 I went to the auto show with my daughter recently down in Dallas 
 and to me the American cars are far superior to the Japanese in styling engines right now I mean
 I'm not saying that they were a couple of years ago
 yeah
 yeah
 I 
 you know they said what do we want to buy 
 I'm not seriously thinking 
 but I would like to put it in that category by a Cadillac 
 but I wouldn't buy a new one 
 and you know of course if I had the money I'd be happy to by a new one
 but I do look for a one year old vehicle with twenty some odd miles or whatever twenty thousand miles whatever
 yeah 
 I remember those
 That she may want to save if she doesn't have it anymore
 That 
 since they don't make them anymore that could be turned into a classic in ten fifteen years 
 No 
 he wanted new one 
 yeah 
 right 
 yeah
 I'm still a full size person
 and I like a full size Cadillac 
 I want one of those 
 I think they are I don't know a classic 
 but they're certainly not 
 they haven't changed in about twenty years 
 and they'll eventually phase them out 
 and I sure would like one ever those within the next five years or so
 Right
 Well even the Japanese cars are bigger too 
 but 
 I've never had a Jap- 
 I've never had a Japanese car 
 I've had friends who had them
 and I think they're a lot over ra- 
 and they're is just no styling to them 
 you can't tell one Japanese car from the other because they all a like
 you know I don't mean that as a joke 
 I mean they really all look a like
 and the 
 I don't have any idea which car it is until I look at it to see what it is
 and I think they have not lead the field in styling 
 they do have sports cars
 but the price is way more 
 you can get a Cadillac for the same price as you can get a small Japanese car 
 it's ridiculous now
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 yeah
 Yeah 
 well if you're interested you ought to go to the next auto show 
 I look at the Cadillacs 
 and boy there were some Cadillacs that I didn't even realize they made 
 but they were just styled so differently
 they were standard Cadillacs 
 but they really looked beautiful
 no 
 they have convertibles now in the Cadillac field 
 and they have that new 
 it's not the big Fleetwood the one I want which is been the same in the last twenty years
 there's another one that has came out in the last two year not the Seville 
 the Seville is totally different
 now at the auto show they had fantastic looking cars
 yeah 
 it was a month or so ago
 Well they have it every year
 Right
 now this was in it downtown in the Convention Center 
 and they had all the cars 
 they had Japanese and German cars
 they had the full range 
 and they had some new cars that weren't even out 
 they had a new Chevy Suburban truck you know 
 that big big one that was 
 they didn't have a price on it nor did they know had a it would cost 
 it had a microwave in it and everything
 it was 
 they had several futuristic cars
 Yeah
 I know
 And I like engines 
 they had a lot of not broken down I mean you know cut displayed engines you know
 Yeah
 but that sold me in buying a new car you know 
 I mean certainly interested in buying a new car 
 but again yeah the American cars were for superior in styling and new engines
 and I thing so because they've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while 
 *[[ spelling "think" ]] and I think that I would definitely buy 
 again there's the question are we in the market 
 and I could buy anything you know
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Well I haven't work on them myself so you know my cars don't go to the shop you know
 so 
 I am the kind of engineer 
 and I've always done it myself 
 and I've got three of them 
 and I can't remember one 
 I think I had one someone welded a muffler on for me in a years time
 I think that's the only thing of the three vehicles that I've in it just the welding on 
 like I said I don't do that you know
 Yeah
 I noticed that when I was a kid 
 I was wasn't a mechanical engineer 
 but I worked my way through college as a mechanic 
 so 
 I learned early from fifteen on and dropped it for a long time after I got out of college and then picked it up again later on 
 and now again I've got three vehicles 
 and I never get in them and just go to the shop at you will you know 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'm keeping V eight Chevy engines because that's what I know
 and in fact I stock the same part 
 I'm like a little stock 
 if you brought your Chevy to me I'd probably have some parts for it right now you knows 
 that's great
 I've always wanted to that too
 I can imagination
