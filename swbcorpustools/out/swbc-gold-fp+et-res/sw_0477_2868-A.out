 Okay 
 have you grown up in Dallas Stephanie
 where are you from
 In Germany
 Well 
 Now there's a place I'd like to visit 
 that's neat
 Uh-huh
 my husband or took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war 
 and so we've seen lots of pictures of the beautiful spots and areas 
 y- Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's neat 
 What kind of vacations do you like
 H- 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 when our children were younger we lived up in or New Jersey [ and + and } used to like traveling into upstate New York and camping 
 and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and that sort of thing 
 but we've never really did any diving or anything 
 Little bit of water skiing 
 But not much of anything else 
 
 Uh-huh 
 It's got to be the water 
 Right 
 when we were in Jersey we used to go down to the Jersey beach a lot and really enjoyed that a lot 
 they had a really nice beach areas there
 Uh-huh
 I see
 That's a really pretty area too 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we loved the New Jersey area too because the lakes were really pretty close you know 
 you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and just really 
 and then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail 
 we did quite a bit of hiking 
 which is kind of fun 
 Are you a hiker or not
 Not so much 
 Uh-huh 
 So your plans are try to find someplace to scuba dive
 You have any children
 Okay 
 then that's probably one of the reasons our 
 we had little children all the time
 so some of the things are not quite as adaptable 
 Yeah 
 it is 
 You have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy too 
 and 
 so I think wha- 
 Yeah 
 Eleven or twelve I would think probably 
 but maybe fifteen even
 I know that one thing that happens to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family 
 You know we go wherever somebody is that we haven't seen for a while 
 So that's kind of 
 we just came back from Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate with his Master's Degree in social work 
 and so that was fun 
 and the summer we have a reunion in Salt Lake area up by Park Cities Where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of a rather large reunion group as we can get together 
 so 
 Ye- 
 Yeah 
 
 we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country 
 I guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe you know like a small camper 
 we've travelled in a big one 
 I hate them because they're hard to jockey around you know 
 but maybe a pickup with the back on 
 Yeah
 So you could kind of sleep in it sometimes 
 but you wouldn't want to do it all the time
 we have enough friends here and there 
 I would just love to just drive through the United States and stop and see people I know and visit for a day and then go on and you know 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I think I think that would real 
 and I would like to maybe not take great long trips but have your home base where your home is and then just travel out for like maybe a month maybe go 
 And 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 There are a lot of neat places to visit in America 
 that's for sure 
 I haven't been much to the south 
 I haven't been in Georgia or Florida or Mississippi or Alabama 
 I guess those are the only states I have not visited 
 But up the coast in Maryland and around there where the early history is there's some 
 Johnstown and in that area is just really neat 
 interesting things to 
 so you know 
 so 
 Yeah 
 we took a trip around to the Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something
 I believe it was 
 had about three kids then I think 
 but that was a really fun interesting trip 
 we read Bruce book before we went you know 
 and so we were ready to look up the places we read about
 It was really interesting Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Well now camping is fun with kids 
 If you're you know 
 once they get a little bigger not teeny tiny ones 
 but even some little ones do pretty good 
 but when they get a little bigger they can help 
 that's a fun way to cut costs 
 and it's enjoyable too 
 Very restful 
 I mean I find 
 Yeah 
 I find the outdoors very relaxing and you know kind of a change
 Yeah 
 Well I'm with you 
 I need my creature comforts too
 Well it was great to talk to you
 Okay 
 see you later 
 Bye-bye
