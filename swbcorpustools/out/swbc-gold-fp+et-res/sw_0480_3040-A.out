 Well we 
 taxes 
 everyone thinks taxes are too high I'm sure 
 But I think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases 
 What do you think
 At this stage it's hard to tell 
 Well at this stage I think we've taxed property almost to the limit because like the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home because of the cost of the taxes on them
 I know 
 I live in Richardson
 and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house
 But now we're getting public services the schools the hospitals 
 and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there look what the schools could cost you
 Yeah 
 Then again the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent 
 and the public colleges also the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country 
 
 one of the 
 I don't know which one it is down there whether it's Hobby or the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition 
 Well if you double the tuition it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states
 Yeah 
 That would provide possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things see
 The so-called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount 
 but eventually I think you may tax people out of smoking even
 Yeah 
 Well I quit ten years ago 
 so I couldn't afford to start again 
 I know 
 my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes I think
 But all the various taxing authorities that come through I think the one tax I resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime
 Well this is a thing 
 I think it's like back east 
 You had to start your public transportation when you started your cities 
 You can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it 
 If we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and construction costs were cheap you could afford it 
 But now digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive
 Absolutely
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere
 New York 
 and some people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car
 Someone made the analogy with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse 
 An old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street 
 Well most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street
 And I'm just as guilty as anyone else
 I drive to work every day by myself without even any thought of car pooling
 <> And most people are that way Because they're used to not having public transportation
 So but here again I think I resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt and doing all these studies and the things 
 we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something
 I felt that was a little wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying you know
 Well that's about all I can say at this time
 Okay 
 it's been real nice talking with you
 Bye
