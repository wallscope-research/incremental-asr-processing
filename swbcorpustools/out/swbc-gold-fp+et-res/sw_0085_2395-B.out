 I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour 
 and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends
 I'm in Dallas
 Are you in Dallas also
 really 
 okay
 Uh-huh
 really
 Uh-huh
 I normally find that I'm probably the most news hungry of my friends 
 so we don't normally talk about the news at lunch 
 I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because I used to get it during the week
 but I would always end up arriving at work late because I would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning
 So I have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work 
 the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television
 and I enjoy that quite a bit
 Uh-huh
 I will admit I work with someone who's Iranian 
 and he definitely has a very different slant on the news
 He's very very skeptical of the news media 
 and I will admit I'm reasonably skeptical also 
 But I don't know he's much more so 
 It's sort of interesting though because he does bring a much different perspective with all the Gulf goings on 
 He was always speaking in terms of you know American imperialism reasserting itself 
 I suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country
 Uh-huh
 True 
 the 
 They tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story
 They will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time 
 Sort of like the what is that A B C's NIGHTLINE
 Well I guess they only normally stick with just the one story 
 But they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories
 No 
 no 
 It's very much national interest news
 A lot of times they end up with these panels of experts 
 and they go back and forth where everyone's giving some opinions 
 and sometimes that 
 I don't know the value of that because I saw plenty of jokes and editorial cartoons about all the retired generals making a living during the Gulf War
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I will admit it's interesting 
 I'm twenty-six 
 So I don't have any more experience in that than you 
 it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind you know 
 there were some that were screaming for air power 
 there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it
 And they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world which I suppose just about everyone does 
 but these guys had a national soap box to stand on and express this view
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I didn't see anything like that although I did 
 I guess one thing that I found sort of interesting 
 this is getting a little off the topic 
 but there was a big push with the local T V stations to have little hot lines with counselors to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children 
 I thought that was a really unusual thing
 Uh-huh
 <> Ju- 
 with the children's aspect
 Uh-huh
 I suppose that is a valuable service 
 Again not having lived through another war I don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of 
 or if that was a new concern with people
 Uh-huh
 That's true 
 That's true
 And <> probably more importantly one that lasted short enough that people's interest didn't flag too badly
 I will admit the same thing 
 And I would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer 
 and they would run these extended two three hour versions of the program
 and I was horrified and fascinated by what I was seeing
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I didn't have that experience 
 I don't have cable
 so I'm pretty much limited to P B S which I thought they did a very good job
 I've got one question for you 
 <> you say you take the newspaper
 I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting 
 We've got the one well relatively weaker paper the TIMES HERALD and then the MORNING NEWS which has a very strong subscription
 Does San Antonio ha- 
 you said San Antonio right
 Do you have just one paper 
 or do you have several
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I actually take both newspapers on the weekends
 I figure I'm only taking on the weekend 
 and I can afford that
 I find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better 
 but I sort of have a liberal political slant 
 and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly conservative editorial outlook
 I get the TIMES HERALD just to balance that out a little bit
 Uh-huh
