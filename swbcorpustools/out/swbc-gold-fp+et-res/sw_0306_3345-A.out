 Well you keep up with current events
 Not 
 Is that right
 Yeah 
 whereabouts in Pennsylvania
 Where in Pennsylvania
 do you 
 well great
 How's 
 well no 
 we're not supposed to talk about that 
 We're supposed to talk about current events
 Well I'm a current event junkie 
 So I try to watch the news 
 and I read the newspaper 
 and I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world
 
 Well I just pretty little you know about everything 
 and then again not everything 
 but you know I like to know pretty well what's happening 
 Political things don't interest me a great deal except I do like to stay informed enough to feel like I halfway vote intelligently you know
 but other than that I just you know 
 just the events that happen around the world interest me Stay in touch with it and feel like I know what's going on 
 Now I have to say all three of my children none of them are too interested in current events
 But I always have been
 and I stay up with it 
 But how do you stay aware of most of the current events newspaper T V news or what
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 that's good
 Well you stay up with it pretty well then
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yes 
 uh-huh 
 you've been there
 well you would be interested in it then
 Yeah 
 I follow it you know 
 I don't just read everything about it 
 but I'm always aware of what's going on like that
 because it's interesting
 and I don't know 
 I feel sorry for those people down there 
 they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many years you know I mean through Papa Doc 
 I mean he was a terrible tyrant
 and I think it's been better since he died 
 but it's still been bad
 but even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew 
 I've read some things about him that he wasn't too good himself
 Yeah 
 he was pretty much a 
 he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things you know
 But It's one of the reasons the U S you know didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him although he's probably better than a lot of them 
 but then again who you know 
 those people are so used to it 
 I guess it's the only thing that works
 I think it's pretty darned good 
 I think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have
 I really do 
 Now they sometimes they jump on it and go a little to the extreme 
 the media does 
 but that's kind of understandable because you know of course if you watch it more than once a day I mean it's the same thing over and over and over and over 
 and I listen to the radio
 so you hear so much 
 you get a little tired of it 
 but then again so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day maybe
 but I think the quality of our news is just I don't believe it could be better
 I really don't
 I don't think so 
 I don't think our news could be better
 I mean I mean what else could they do to make it better
 I don't see anything that they could do
 Well you always want to think everything can be improved upon
 I understand what you're saying
 But by trial and error over the years I think they got it about as good as they're going to get it
 nothing is perfect
 Uh-huh
 Well that's true 
 I understand what you're saying 
 and then again I understand why they can't dig too much deeper 
 that's why we have C N N
 C N N has the time since that's all they do is news to dig deeper
