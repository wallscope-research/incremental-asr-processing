 Hi 
 So what was the last car repair you had
 Oh
 no 
 Did you crack the block or what
 Yeah 
 I see
 You got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though
 That can be pretty serious
 I guess it's been awhile for me 
 I'd sa- 
 it's been about a year
 Yeah 
 I had the water pump break on my car
 Yeah 
 I was traveling 
 I was going on my way home from Thanksgiving
 and it broke like in the middle of nowhere
 So I had to get it towed and then fixed 
 and 
 big pain 
 Yeah 
 that's where I was 
 Luckily someone came by and gave me a ride
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 so is mine 
 Yeah 
 I'm hoping mine gets me through 
 I got until May until I'm out 
 So when I cross that one I'll be okay
 that's nice 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I don't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is 
 and it's not worth it 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I got new tires last winter too 
 so I'm like well that's the last major purchase for this thing 
 It's not worth it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we get some killer winters up here in the mountains
 Yeah
 Lot of snow and a lot of cold
 Yeah 
 at times there's a lot of it
 You got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance
 Yeah 
 I haven't had a big problem with that though
 So I've been pretty lucky there
 Yeah 
 that's usually pretty good 
 You just rinse it off after the winter is over and done with it
 Yeah 
 I usually like to do most repairs on my own though
 Yeah 
 just because that way I know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't
 Yeah 
 Plus if something goes wrong I know who to blame
 More fun things to do
 Well that's nice
 Yeah
 One is bad enough 
 Yeah 
 I was just wondering that 
 Yeah 
 I didn't either
 Yeah 
 this must be a hard category
