 Okay 
 do I still feel that the Soviet Union as such is still a threat to the civilized western world 
 Absolutely 
 And my reasons are based upon not only what I see on the newspapers but up against some of the fun and exciting things I ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group
 Well that's what makes it a powder keg 
 The 
 I'll go back in time a little bit to about eighty-one when my first real involvement with the military started 
 naturally we were at the time 
 the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat 
 So we got quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons
 I went to Lebanon in eighty-three before the marines ever got there with the U N Peace Keeping Force with the training I received prior to going there with captured weapons we kept running up against 
 these weren't Chinese made copies 
 These were Soviet made top of the line fresh out of the box A K forty-sevens As well as a lot of the explosives we were running into 
 In Granada in October twenty-fifth eighty-three we invaded the place 
 Sure there were Cuban soldiers there 
 but there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots 
 The team I was with we jumped in on the western tip of the island down on Point Salinas 
 And for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors
 And they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons 
 In eighty-four I was down in Central America as an advisor to the Honduran Army 
 Again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit plus Soviet advisors 
 And the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans was brand new out of the crate Soviet made material 
 Do I consider them a threat 
 Absolutely 
 They have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University 
 About like A and M or U T where they're teachings subjects like that they're teaching terrorism 
 Some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place 
 And let me tell you they are nothing nice to go up against
 I'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did 
 These guys are top of the line 
 when they graduate from there they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world 
 And they are very very good at what they do 
 So until I see the entire quote old guard of the Soviet government completely roll over and disappear preferably buried I still consider them a threat
 Their military is different from ours to where there are extremist generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops 
 That 
 irregardless of what Soviet policy is they're going to do what the general tells them
 Well it's interesting watching the different Soviet states Albania Lithuania doing their little revolts down there
 Each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there 
 So far they haven't run into the real psychos yet 
 There's probably five or six which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs that are in positions over some of these Soviet states 
 If uprisings happen in their sectors it's going to be a total blood bath
 Actually they're showing remarkable restraint 
 They get real nasty the hyundee helicopters come out 
 and they would level entire areas 
 Okay 
 you're from the Dallas area right
 Okay 
 you know basically the size of the area around Richardson
 You put five Soviet hyundee helicopters in the air they can level the entire area 
 and there won't be anything left alive 
 And they can do that in about four minutes
 And they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by 
 They used them in Afghanistan did remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in 
 But on a highly populated area like some of the Soviet cities would be with the weaponry that's attached on those things there is no place to hide 
 If the bombs don't get you if the bullets don't get you then the nerve gas definitely will get you 
 The only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time 
 They drink that much fuel
 Were you 
 have you 
 I take it you haven't spent any time in the military
 As a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military 
 I know a lot of this stuff that I was involved in never did make the newspapers
 But during that same time frame didn't you get some feeling that I mean they're getting all these weapons and stuff 
 Didn't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff
 In any of them since eighty-one
 It all boils down to whether it's our side their side 
 it's a matter of money to a certain extent
 The deal the Iraqi's have with the Russians was for oil
 the ones to the south are more regional conflict 
 They're not really that worried about invading north 
 They're more interested in 
 they've got a screwed up situation I'll give them that From Mexico all the way down into Central and South America 
 The situation down there is weird 
 and it's very screwed up
 Inflation is out of this world 
 and the governments which our government has technically supported for years are corrupt as all get out 
 And generally the people are getting screwed 
 and they're tired of it 
 and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it even if that means going to communism
 Unfortunately Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard 
 That's the only drawback that I see with the entire thing
 Gorbachev has made his attempt 
 and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself
 Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard 
 So it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils at this point
 You mean 
 I understand when or they reduced the number of troops in Europe after the Berlin Wall went down 
 I thought that was great 
 But by no means do I endorse or approve pulling everybody out
 It may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there 
 But you still better have the key players in place if something does go down Even if it's a regional conflict 
 If United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is not only does it talk the talk but it's got to be able to walk the walk 
 It's got to have the stuff to back up what it's saying 
 If you've only got a token force there you can't hold your ground
