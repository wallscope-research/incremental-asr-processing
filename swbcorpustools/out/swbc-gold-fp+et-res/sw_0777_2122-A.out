 Okay 
 so do you own a P C
 But you have one at work
 Okay 
 and now because 
 see I'm doing my Master's in Computer Science and Computer Engineering
 and I don't have one 
 but I have to use them like especially during my undergrad
 you use 
 like your first couple of years you use personal computers because you know the software 
 You know like it's easier for you to go to and run a program you know through the disk because the grader can do it at home
 Then you know as you go up higher like in your senior level you're doing projects which are so big 
 and you have to have so many people sharing the same data that you can't use personal computers so you have to use you know a main frame
 okay
 But does it have like a disk drive
 okay 
 because the ones that we use you know are like UNIX base systems
 And so they don't have a disk drive
 You know so you can't 
 the only way that you can do it is through a modem
 And you know you just do it that way
 But that's the only way that you can get through to the system 
 you can't store it anywhere
 okay
 And then you also have to do all your grading on the P C
 okay
 Okay
 Yeah
 Well for us you know it's like for doing like you know like resumes and presentations
 We use like for example a Mackintosh which is a lot easier for graphics than you know the I B M P C's or anything compatible with that
 due to the fact that well you know I haven't tested the P S two yet
 but I don't know if the software is as easily you know like you can manage it a lot easier than the old one
 The old one you had to go pick a line use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start and where you know with the mouse you do it you know like a hundred times faster
 And you also get you know 
 when you see it on the Mackintosh with you know the one I have 
 that doesn't have any color 
 you can look at it 
 and that's the way it's going to print out
 And especially if you have a laser printer it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen
 And so you know with the I B M what would happen is since the software that I had was it was basically you know you only see part of the page
 And so the whole page you never can actually see it
 you just draw it 
 and they have to zoom out and zoom in 
 and you know it's like every time that you have to do something it's really a pain
 And also you know it's like for presentations 
 it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a P C
 it can be easily represented on a P C 
 You know like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all these numbers
 and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not you know
 But with a new system I can calculate everything so fast you know like for spread sheets
 You can see what the trend is over the years
 Yeah 
 [ that 
 [ I had a program due 
 and one window I had the program 
 and the other one I had the program running so if there was ever a mistake I could easily check you know 
 I could look at the program and say this is where I made the error
 Instead of saying where did I make the error
 You know go back and forth 
 and you know you always you know 
 the old ones you had to go out of your program well load up the program again in this case 
 After you load it up change it hope that's right get out of that run the program run uh-huh as long as it took and then go back and see if that worked or not
 But with windows you can have the program 
 and say it messed up in line fifty-four
 So you take a look at line fifty-four 
 you take a look at the output at the same time 
 and you can see where it messed up because you know it's like in the old computers the ones that we're using here a couple of years ago you would always have to have a printout every time that you ran your program *[[end of slash unit]] you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the background
 *[[should have been new slash unit]] did you learn it in computer science
 And when was this
 okay
 Yeah 
 I know because all I know is that when I came here in eighty-seven it was the last year to put all your punch cards in
 So yeah 
 No 
 but it was just sensational because I walked in 
 and they go my God they're still using this
 It was like this is the last year you can put your punch cards in and get your program out 
 and you know You can get a hard copy of it 
 and that's about it
 So But I mean the price of computers has gone down 
 They said that if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since you know it started they said that cars would cost two dollars 
 and they would run forever
 So I mean it's like you know the joke with the Yugo you know 
 it's like yeah you know when your car runs out of gas just throw it away
 And that's the way it would be
 It's like yeah I think I'll buy a new car today you know 
 so 
 Yeah 
 but I mean the price has really gone down 
 I mean I B M which 
 an I B M P C in like in nineteen eighty-one it would cost you five thousand dollars
 and now you can get it you know like for one thousand dollars you know because of the parts basically
 Yeah 
 The parts and the labor is what they're charging you 
 they're not charging you you know over pricing it because it's like if we sell it for less you know it's like we're losing money you know
 It's like we want to sell it to break even at least
 And I think they stopped producing the I B M P C
 and the P C Junior was a total failure to them
 They had 
 they're trying to get out small computers 
 but the only problem was that when they took that one out the small computer was the I B M P C 
 And so you couldn't you know 
 it's like sure bring out N- into the market something that's smaller when nobody uses anything that's smaller than you know this you know
 And so 
 But over the past years it's like I B M has been producing like 
 every two years they bring out a whole new system You know like the P C X T A T and the P S one P S two things you know 
 and so It's just that you have to always compete 
 and Mackintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools
 Because of their you know 
 you can work with it a lot easier
 So that's what they're trying to do 
 well I'll leave you back to your work
 And have a good lunch
 All right 
 bye bye
