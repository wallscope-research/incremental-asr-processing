 Well not necessarily in Dallas 
 but it's a very short drive to areas near here
 Well I have done camping in the past 
 I can't remember when the last time I actually went camping was 
 It was several years ago 
 and then I did most of my camping in the mountains
 Well it is 
 I enjoy hiking and camping 
 We went to the 
 I have some land there 
 and so it's handy to station yourself there on the land and then make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and overnight camping
 Do you do most of yours in tents
 wow
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 No 
 I agree with you 
 I think it's much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where that you can't see people right out the window 
 But 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Doesn't that always taste so much better when you're out like that 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 If you don't you'll find every rock on it when you put your bag down
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 what a clever idea
 I wouldn't have thought about that
 that's a good idea
 Uh-huh 
 Well if you get a chance 
 now there are some really nice camping areas up in the Wichitas which is in Oklahoma and Arkansas
 I can't remember the name 
 it's on the Oklahoma-Arkansas border
 And it won't take but you know just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are
 but I took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last September just took the drive through to see what was there
 They have some wonderful camping areas there
 Beautiful beautiful country
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 well Lake Tawakoni is a pretty nice place
 and we had a two bedroom mobile home there 
 but the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitos bit and then they came in
 they're grown now
 They go camping on their own
 Once you start them they enjoy it all their lives
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 don't be concerned 
 There's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well it's easy to keep him occupied though on land 
 I know that I took my kids we'd go out 
 and I've them walk with me along the lakefront
 and we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell 
 or we'd hunt pine cones or we climbed some pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so that we could eat the pine nuts
 And we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out 
 we searched for 
 and we ate the wild plants 
 and we gathered wild berries 
 and it's really you know 
 the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find
 Uh-huh 
 I had my boys build their own little you know three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark
 And we cooked in a pot 
 I baked them a cake right there on a camp fire 
 They were so impressed
 I used a tire chain and the bottom of a Dutch oven
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-oh
 Well if our time is up we can quit
 Okay 
 Uh-huh
 You bet 
 bye-bye
