 Okay
 You were helping your parents
 Uh-huh
 So you're remodeling
 Okay
 Well I live in an apartment now 
 two summers ago I went to Massachusetts
 and I went with a friend of mine 
 and we undertook a building house
 And this was a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions 
 and it's preconstructed you might say
 And we started from an empty lot with trees and stuff on it 
 and we had to cut them down and clear the lot 
 We had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement Pour the basement and went from the ground up 
 one of our main problems was 
 well in Massachusetts I thought I was going to 
 well it was a fun time 
 but I thought gosh summer time you know 
 Well all it ever did was rain and thunder storms 
 And one thing is that we were going to pour the basement foundation
 And we're in the process 
 and it started pouring down rain
 And I guess we had most of it done 
 but the end was result 
 what happened was that a lot of water settled on the top 
 and it really didn't give a very good finish 
 and some of the 
 it was sort of sandy and not a very good finish
 But it was okay 
 and it's only the basement floor 
 so it was okay
 But it kept us pretty busy 
 It was only 
 there was well me and my friend 
 and then we just had like two helpers and sort of a family type 
 it wasn't you know like a commercial project or something 
 It was sort of just you know get my brother and well maybe you know my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing So that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes 
 and then materials coming in 
 and so we're hopping around pretty good 
 But overall yeah we got it done 
 and it's a three bedroom two bath house 
 and it's pretty neat
 Yeah 
 So 
 Well it was for my friend's parents 
 They had some property there 
 and they'd lived in this old 
 it's sort of like a farm you might say 
 And they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something 
 And his mom just wanted a new house You know 
 that has been her dream 
 And so we did that 
 And she was really pleased with it 
 So it came really great 
 so 
 So why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot
 Where you live it gets very hot
 And that's why you 
 and the windows what type of windows are you putting in
 Because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in you know the solar game
 Have you 
 what are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or 
 okay 
 Okay 
 Uh-huh
 Okay 
 these 
 so you have the sash windows in
 did it go up and down
 I see
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 there's a problem with those 
 Those are 
 they usually most of the time don't open very well 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 And they 
 a lot of vibration 
 and it causes the glass to crack 
 and it's a never ending problem
 So I haven't been in any really home repair things lately 
 I
