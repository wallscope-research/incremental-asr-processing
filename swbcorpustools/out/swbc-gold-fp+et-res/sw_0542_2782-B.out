 I guess so 
 Okay
 Okay 
 Yeah 
 *[[slash error]] Okay
 *[[slash error should be 'aa']] Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 no
 That throws the budget out of whack real fast
 good
 Really 
 That was smart 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Wow that's great
 Did you have a special program on your computer to do that 
 or was this just your own design of 
 Uh-huh
 Gosh
 Yeah 
 *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 *[[slash error]] Yeah
 Well we've been married for five and a half years 
 and we started out without kids of course and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more fun kinds of of things and did really you know have a real strict but budget 
 but the 
 about and 
 to our 
 when we first got married we were in graduate school 
 and we were just you know dirt poor 
 Then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house 
 So we virtually did that for about two years which worked real well and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved and moved to Texas bought a house immediately you know which of course is now devalued with the housing market 
 so I don't know if we did a good thing to buy a house or not 
 but at least we've got a place to live 
 so now since we have a three year old and a two year old now 
 Uh-huh
 that threw our budget really out of whack too 
 An we have been just forced to budget much more because I quit working to be home with the kids 
 And we just really have 
 I don't know 
 we've tried different times 
 we've done like a survey of like taking you know the past three months of where all the money went
 And we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all 
 but it seems like there's times when we just have to get out where we'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we'll go and we'll blow you know fifty sixty dollars in one night going out to eat going to a show or doing something you know
 Yeah 
 that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week 
 and then it's not really that realistic 
 because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for you know birthday for somebody 
 or you know we even do things real frugally for the kids 
 we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age you know whether they're JORDACHE new or whether they're *[[listen; "because" may start new utt unit]] you know something 
 and they're both boys 
 so they just one year after the other in each other's clothes 
 so But that's the hardest part for us is that it's really you know budgeting and some extra things you know that are more you know nonessential items
 <> Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 On your friends 
 that's true 
 that's true 
 Well we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with 
 we both have older cars 
 and something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars you know on the car in two months or something
 and you know a lot of things like that that really are hard to plan for 
 And 
 Yeah 
 kind of put in a certain amount per year
 *[[82 and 84 same utt]] you're going to have on extra expenses for car 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions you know is to 
 let's see 
 now I forget which way we do it 
 We don't list all the deductions 
 and then we get more money back you know at the end of the year
 so that's not a good way to 
 that's what my husband said 
 so this last year he changed it of course 
 we didn't get nearly as much back 
 and it was like oh no 
 Better find another way of saving money 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 because we don't miss it 
 we really don't when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff 
 But we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can envision the expenses for college already you know eighteen years away or whatever
 Gosh
 I guess
 that's fantastic 
 Yeah 
 Well I enjoyed talking to you too 
 good luck 
 and don't spend any money this weekend 
 boy
 Bye
