 Well I have used several techniques depending on what 
 for undergraduate you know my criteria were much different than like for graduate school 
 when I wanted to go to an undergraduate institution I was looking for something that was you know rather small and easy to get around you know And what I thought would be easy to get through

 I got to where I wanted to graduate you know with a name behind me rather than 
 yeah
