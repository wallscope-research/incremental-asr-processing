 Okay
 So what do you think about it 
 Should 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 it's funny 
 because I know people that are in all three and people that work you know 
 I know someone that works in all three different stages like you said
 And I have known you know people close to me that have been in all three 
 and I have seen them like go from where they're in an apartment building 
 we call it 
 well we have high rises 
 and it's just for elderly people you know 
 or one of their spouses has already passed away
 And it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through
 And it's really nice to go and see them you know where they can still get around and everything 
 and they still you know do their own thing 
 but it's really nice to see them because 
 I mean sometimes 
 like I had a great aunt 
 she lived with us for three months because she's starting to get Alzheimer's disease 
 And I know I have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters 
 and I know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to actually sit down because she doesn't like doing things that the younger kids like doing
 And to actually sit 
 so it's really nice to see that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'm in college 
 and I'm only twenty-one 
 but I had a speech class last semester 
 and there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly
 And I was so surprised to hear how many people 
 like whenever they're in you know the older people they're like fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because you know they wander the halls And they get the wrong medicine just because you know the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine
 And so many of them you know are 
 Yes 
 And it was awful to hear you know what some of these people really went through 
 And I forget the percentage of people you know that she had said 
 and I mean she did research on it and everything
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I know 
 and sometimes they share a room 
 and it's just a little cubbyhole
 and they share it with another person 
 and they're still paying that much
 [ it + [ it just sometimes it just seems ] ] ridiculous
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I've been lucky 
 well my mom's parents they're both in their eighties 
 and I was just home for spring break 
 and my grandma she goes well maybe we'll just sell the house 
 She said it's getting too big for us to take care of 
 And I was like no 
 no 
 no
 stay in the house as long as you can
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 It sounds like an apartment or som- 
 Oh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 really
 See now we've run into a lot of problems where our relatives were 
 well I've lived here for thirty years
 and this is our home 
 and we have nothing else to show for our lives 
 and we don't want to leave
 we've run into a lot of that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 That's what like 
 well now I know we have an ol- 
 we call it an old folks home 
 but it's basically a nursing home too 
 but everyone has basically their own room
 And you know th- 
 none of them have cars because they can't drive
 But if someone would come to get them you know they're allowed to leave with them 
 and there's a staff there that makes supper for them 
 and each person has a chore 
 like maybe Wednesday night it's George's turn to set all the tables
 And it's really nice because that keeps them going too rather than just sitting around
 And I know our youth group goes over 
 and we play bingo with them and you know like stuff like that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 just to keep them going 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 But I think before i- 
 like you 
 + I don't think it's right to just put someone in it 
 I think they would have to agree to go in it
 Well yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
