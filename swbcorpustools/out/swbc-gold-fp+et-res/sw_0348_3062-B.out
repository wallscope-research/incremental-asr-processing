 Well we've talked a little bit about the Plano school system 
 I really have been pleased with Plano 
 I have a child who 
 my son is learning disabled
 and I thank God every day that I have the resources that we have tapped into
 He's in elementary school
 And he's not severely learning disabled
 I mean you know He's being helped 
 he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math
 and they recently released him from resource which I was thrilled 
 I really was 
 I just thought that was so neat that they got him over that hump 
 And he's in the Herman Method of Reading 
 I don't know if you're familiar with that 
 It is something new 
 and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters
 
 It's wonderful
 Yes 
 and it's wonderful 
 He didn't have a problem with reading 
 As a matter of fact he's reading on level 
 The problem was his spelling 
 And you know in watching the way he has struggled 
 it's interesting because I'm convinced I have the same learning disability or had that was ignored 
 And 
 That's right 
 and so you know it's not an intelligence problem 
 It's just a problem with learning
 Well you know it's funny 
 when he was in first grade he had trouble with spelling
 and I would say to the teacher you know it's amazing 
 He will be able to 
 you'll say to him spell cat 
 and you know he'll say C A T 
 and then he would go to write it 
 and he would write C O T
 And I kept saying to the teacher something is wrong here 
 Something is wrong here
 And the teacher kept saying he has a May birthday 
 He's just immature
 Well second grade it was 
 I will 
 these teachers as far as I'm concerned are absolute saints because in second grade it was about the second week of school I went up there 
 and I requested a conference because all year long they kept telling me I was crazy
 Well I was 
 and I went up there the second week of school 
 and I said you know something is wrong 
 and thank God the head teacher the team leader was a special education major
 it was 
 and She had picked it up 
 yep
 she had already picked it up 
 And she said you know we were going to call you if you hadn't called us 
 We think there's a learning disability 
 and we think he needs to be tested immediately because you know once the first report card comes in they have all these people being tested 
 and she said I think we can get him real fast
 And sure enough they tested him 
 and you know he qualified for the help 
 and it's been great 
 and I thank God I'm here because I know I have a sister who has the other extreme 
 She has a child in Connecticut who is extremely gifted 
 and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her
 and to me that's the same thing 
 it's like having a child who has a learning disability that's being ignored this poor gifted child is being ignored
 That's true
 That's true
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Right
 Right
 Exactly 
 and They don't take them 
 that's right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Really 
 really
 Yeah
 Well when comparing test scores 
 I know recently I was in a discussion 
 and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools
 and that was one of the points that I made is that you're not comparing apples to apples
 You know you can't say you know I know Steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability into a private school which is too bad 
 But on the other hand I can't necessarily blame them you know they are a private school 
 and they can do whatever they want
 And they 
 that's right 
 they have the ability to be selective 
 But you can't say then well public schools are not as good
 Perhaps they are because they're 
 You're right
 really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 well you see that with the foreigners that come here
 I was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they said that you know these children they had to be the best 
 and they put off all social life all everything you know 
 Well is that good 
 Yes 
 the child is very bright 
 but on the other hand I feel like my children who are kind of middle of the road are more rounded you know
 Sure 
 sure 
 I think it's real important to have friends 
 I think it's real important to play sports 
 I think it's real important to be part of a team
 And so that's why I said their childhood is extremely different from mine 
 We didn't do all that you know 
 We certainly didn't carpool and run the way I do 
 No
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
