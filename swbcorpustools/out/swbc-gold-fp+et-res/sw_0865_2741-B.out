 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I probably a little bit older than you are 
 so what I see is 
 the change that I see the most is that women have many more occupations and careers to choose from than when I went to college 
 When I went to college you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or a secretary 
 but there were very few women in business at that time 
 A few 
 but they were the oddity 
 And Yes 
 And now I see 
 and I see for my daughter which is wonderful this 
 she's thirteen 
 and I see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from
 so many different jobs which I think is terrific
 Because I'm a teacher 
 and I mean I love teaching 
 but I think there are a lot of other things I would have liked better
 And not that I would give the career up because it's a safe career plus because I always have a job plus I am a single parent too
 and I need the income
 and I think that's the reason why a lot of women have started to work too is because economically it's just a must
 you just 
 it's very difficult to get along on one income unless the male has an extraordinarily good job
 And especially men who teach school they don't make that much money 
 and most all 
 they always either have 
 they're either moonlighting or else their wife works too
 it's just an economic need now
 definitely
 Uh-huh 
 yes 
 exactly 
 We have quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents 
 and the majority is married couple with children 
 but still there's a lot more than there used to be 
 And see you never picture yourself in a situation like this 
 When I married I thought I'd be married the rest of my life
 but I'm really grateful that I went to college 
 My mother always said you know get an education in case you need one because my father died when we were 
 I have a twin sister 
 and we were eleven when he died 
 and she had a nursing degree
 and she was able to make it 
 But she said you never know what's going to happen 
 and I thank God that I did go to college and got a degree because otherwise I don't know how I would be able to raise my children
 Isn't that something 
 Yes
 Yes 
 yes 
 Yeah 
 I do too 
 But I think it needs to continue to change 
 and I think there's still not equality as far as paychecks for men and women 
 I think that we still have a long way to go
 Uh-huh 
 And I think by the year two thousand it we're going to see a lot more changes hopefully that women are you know able to get the executive jobs and hold positions that men do because they can do it just as well you know 
 if they want to dedicate most of their time to that they can do it
 Uh-uh
 Exactly 
 Exactly 
 And I think that's the way it should be 
 I think it 
 I mean not that I think that I'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that I could never do strength wise and so forth
 but also there's some things women can do like have children that men can't do
 So you know it 
 I don't want to be equal 
 but I want to get what I deserve 
 and I want to be able to be on the same level with them 
 If I can do a job as well as I man I think I should get the same pay you know
 And I'm not a women's libber 
 I really am not 
 But I think that we have just as many rights as they do 
 And I feel like if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then they should get the job with the same pay
 I do too
 I do too 
 Definitely 
 Well it was good to talk to you
 All right
 Bye-bye
