 Yes
 I think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children 
 We have three children who are eleven nine and eight 
 So this is the big issue with us Although I don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about 
 but perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time 
 and 
 Anyway 
 You don't have children
 But you're married
 Oh
 You know I know we're not supposed to do this long distance 
 but actually I'm getting a call 
 I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting 
 Could I ask you to hold one minute
 I'll be right back 
 Excuse me just a moment 
 They're going to get mad 
 Hello
 I'm so sorry
 That was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting
 Well I don't want this to be a unilateral conversation
 but yes 
 we do
 Both my husband and I work 
 and our children are sixth fourth and third grade 
 And the school years are wonderful 
 they're just wonderful
 The kids they are real people 
 and they are interesting 
 and they have all their own activities 
 and I think as parents we really enjoy them in our personal situation
 our children have not yet decided to rebel 
 I'm sure that's coming though 
 But they are wonderful kids
 You had eight boys and one girl
 Are you Mormons
 That's what the Utah and the large family
 Well we're Catholics 
 I came from a family of five 
 I had four brothers
 the only girl
 And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled
 I never felt spoiled
 In fact I always thought my toys were destroyed 
 No 
 Usually busy fighting for survival
 Well I do think with working parents I mean there are some real issues here that I think 
 I don't know 
 It's an interesting problem 
 I happen to 
 I'm a pediatrician
 My husband is a physician 
 so I talk to parents about this a lot 
 But children 
 I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home need very early to come to grips with any guilt that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family
 And I feel when my children were very young I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing 
 And I long ago decided I'm a better mother because I work outside the home
 I really believe that 
 And it has helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that I think are wonderful particularly at this age 
 and I think our kids are real secure And have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot 
 so I know it sounds like a rationalization 
 but I really think it's true for our family
 and I think it has worked very well
 There's no question 
 I think that's really the best 
 if a woman is happy doing that
 I hate to put it quite that way
 I was twenty-nine when I had my first child 
 and I would not have been real fulfilled 
 I really would not have been totally staying home with a young child
 it's wonderful to be a mother 
 but I like the way I did it
 I sort of worked half time 
 I had very flexible hours 
 I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year 
 and you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I preach all the time to mothers
 and I think we choose very carefully the alternative situations that we had them in
 Some baby-sitting groups 
 again I know it sounds like a rationalization 
 but I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children 
 and they learn to share 
 They learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure
 I think that helps
 Well So your wife does she work right now
 She's out 
 You're still trying to dry out
