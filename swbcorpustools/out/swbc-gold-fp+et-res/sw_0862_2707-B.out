 yeah
 Yeah 
 it's very hot 
 in fact I've been cleaning because I live in an apartment
 so I can't do very much gardening other than balcony gardening you know 
 I have the little flower boxes with a lot of different flowers 
 and I do enjoy plants 
 but I don't have a yard or anything that I can do gardening really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Well the Uh-huh
 Yes 
 but 
 Uh-huh 
 so you enjoy gardening
 Uh-huh

 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'm sure it is you know different in the different areas 
 I'm originally from Pennsylvania 
 and I do go home on weekends during the Summer and mow my mother's grass and different things like that
 I would have no idea 
 No idea whatsoever
 Like I said I'm just a balcony kind of gardener with my little flowers and my flower boxes and my herbs on my window sill 
 and 
 Yeah 
 I have to start all over every year
 well except I do have some some day lilies that you know I don't do anything with 
 and they seem to come back year after year 
 and I leave them on my balcony even in in the snow and the Winter you know in the ice everything because here you know not as severe as the snow is in Pennsylvania 
 but here we still do get some snow and ice and things like that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right 
 I agree with that
 Uh-huh

 I'm 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 you don't sound like it 
 Uh-huh 
 I've been called a lot 
 at the times though it's been not very appropriate 
 I guess that I haven't been able to actually participate 
 I've participated probably in about maybe I don't know seven calls
 and you know I've called a couple of times 
 but most of the time I notice that you know it takes forever to get a call through
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah

 No 
 I haven't
 Uh-huh

 Uh-huh
 right now the District 
 Washington
 in Fairfax Virginia 
 It's fifteen miles west of Washington D C
 Yeah 
 there's a few 
 not you know nearly as many as what's actually in the District 
 But they're definitely enjoyable
 Right now I know the azaleas and everything are out are beautiful
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 there is a vast variety here of you know trees 
 like if I look out my window right now I can see you know couple of pine trees some oak trees
 yeah
 no 
 actually I haven't
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 well I guess that I really don't know that much

 but then what about people that 
 I personally work with someone that is deaf and cannot speak 
 She can speak 
 but she can't speak very clearly
 and she in fact is a data entry person 
 I mean she types away all day
