 Uh-huh
 baseball
 Well I've kind of been intrigued with the Rangers more so with their management than anything else 
 I don't follow baseball that closely 
 but you know since I live here so close to Arlington that's the team that I've been kind of following
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well I think that you know with so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's you know I think 
 I'm not real sure about th- 
 do you know anything about Ruben Sierra's 
 Yeah 
 that he was willing to come down a little bit if the Rangers will go up a little bit *[[ I think this should end in a slash B's next turn seems to start with a backchannel of A19 ]] Yeah 
 *[[ I think this should be an independent utt; see note on B18 ]] but a little bit you know from thirty million dollars or thirty-five mil- 
 that's a lot of money
 Yeah 
 they are 
 Uh-huh
 And I really think that they ought to 
 I'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money 
 I think they should pay him what his salary is going to be and let him 
 because he's got one more year before he turns into a free agent
 And then who knows 
 if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway 
 but if he doesn't then his market value will go down 
 and they can pick him up for a lot less than they would if they paid him you know the six million dollars a year this year
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 but you know what he 
 that was a great deal for him
 Yeah 
 it was a great deal for him 
 and he just signed on 
 I think it was like a five year deal with Pittsburgh
 So you know he's real happy there 
 As far as the Rangers are concerned I think they definitely need some pitching
 and so you know I 
 The pitching coach
 Well you know I was just looking at the news tonight 
 and they showed a black guy that was helping out His assistant
 And I think that's a great addition 
 I mean he seemed to know what he was doing 
 and 
 you don't like Howse 
 Tom Grieve
 Yeah 
 I'm not sure that they're ready to get rid of Tom Grieve yet 
 but Howse might be a different situation 
 and I think you're probably right that they need you know some changes in pitching coach maybe 
 and 
 You do 
 That's contrary to popular belief you know 
 I know 
 You know it's too bad that it has to be a forty-two year old guy to lead the Rangers you know
 They need to have some young guys that can take the lead 
 and 
 Yeah
