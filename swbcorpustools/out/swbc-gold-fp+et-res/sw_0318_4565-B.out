 Yes 
 Yeah

 That's what I've heard too 
 Yeah
 Right
 I know it 
 I tell myself sometimes just sit down after work 
 really
 Well good for you 
 Good for you 
 I talk to a lot of people about that 
 and I've thought about it myself 
 and I though about it a lot 
 But I still haven't done it yet 
 Well that's good
 That's true 
 I've noticed that 
 I don't think so either 
 Do you keep your kids active in sports or anything 
 or 
 okay
 Okay
 No 
 Not for kids 
 Yeah 
 Well I try and read to them 
 and I take them to the park and stuff 
 and Yeah

 Well they get to that stage 
 Sleep book 
 no
 We've got quite a few of DOCTOR SEUSS' books
 really
 Well yeah 
 I like to do it 
 and they enjoy reading 
 I've actually I never read ] a lot growing up 
 and I never read until a few years ago 
 I just started picking up books 
 and so I've found that you know it's really important to me to get to read 
 To I like to ] get away in a book you know
 And so I've put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids to try and 
 I probably spend an hour or two
 My wife works at night 
 so she does Tupperware 
 so she's gone a lot at nights 
 and so I spend a lot of time with them 
 They're two and one
 Uh-huh
