 We 
 well my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class
 He's an aerobics instructor And is going to be entering North Texas for a Kinesiology program there
 *[[two utts]] And the 
 how I met him was through the aerobics class that he used to teach
 Yeah 
 so I'm an avid aerobics person and just very very athletic 
 Enjoying you know anything dealing with sports 
 So and how do you feel about it 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well I've 
 my 
 that's the way my mother stands on it 
 She feels like if it's something that you have to do you know if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes a chore
 and she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore 
 So and I feel that way too as far as you know just sitting and you know the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something you know 
 to 
 you're a calcu- you know 
 calculated down 
 and do your calisthenics you know three times a week 
 but I do try and regulate how much exercise I get a week
 Yeah
 And it's got 
 and I've always enjoyed dance
 So it involves you know 
 I can't get out to dance all the time 
 and 
 Yeah 
 and it's more regulated 
 I mean you're using different parts of the body
 So it is like dance 
 and it's structured like that 
 but you have the music and like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me
 And someone else is telling me okay you know let's move this way let's move that way instead of me having to think about it so much
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 But I'm like you 
 I also like to participate in things like 
 well we just went to the Myererson Symphony Run this past weekend 
 and that was a lot of fun 
 and you get to meet different people and just get out you know out and about 
 and it's something you can all 
 like our 
 we did it as a family 
 so it was quite a lot of fun
 and biking 
 and I love to swim 
 so I love it when you know it's swimming weather
 and 
 Oh 
 I didn't realize that
 I'm sorry
 Well I'm in Texas 
 I just assumed that I had 
 this is the first call I've done
 and I didn't realize that they were going to reach out to people from all over the country
 You wouldn't know that 
 I 
 Uh-huh
 Well I think people are more inc- 
 people from California seem to be more health motivated all around I mean as far as the diet and everything the diet and just your health consciousness 
 and I mean it just seems like a lot of those ideas generate out of California 
 Not just exercise but health related ideas 
 And I 
 it's curious I don't know why don't know if it's 
 do you 
 does California have a 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Now do you think that's because they've realized that for whole health that you know you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program
 Do you think the program came first or the 
 Yeah 
 the more money they put into it
 I can see that 
 And cause I 
 knowing 
 from institutes of learning like that I know that they've got to get their money somewhere 
 and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Or they're older 
 Well don't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar- 
 I sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city
 I live in a rural area 
 so *[[needs slash]] you know I see that 
 *[[sd]] like it's frantic you know to achieve something that a person in a rural area almost doesn't worry about it to such a degree but stays you know almost healthier you know
 *[[slash error; one utt with 116]] as a fit person 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well don't you think a lot of that is diet too
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and as we can see 
 Well I'm a practicing vegetarian 
 so I've read a lot of information knowing that to be true 
 What's that
 are you also 
 Well that's good as far as the cal- 
 is that pretty predominant as far as California do- doe- 
 In the urban areas 
 Uh-huh 
 that's wonderful
 Yeah
 That's great 
 I mean we 
 it's such a trouble here 
 I mean you just have to eat at home basically
 Well of course in the cities 
 yeah 
 well in the cities 
 we live close to Dallas
 so which you know 
 you get an influx of a lot of people from all over the country 
 so you're going to have more choices 
 but in urban areas it's you know steak places 
 and it's not a you know 
 it's definitely 
 it's changing to a degree 
 but it's very frustrating *[[slash error]] And even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or organic you know materials and foods and things 
 You don't really have that 
 I mean you would think
