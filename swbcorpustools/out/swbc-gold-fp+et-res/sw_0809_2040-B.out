 I was a resident although very young of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state 
 so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico 
 I know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive 
 and I have a suspicion that I believe that the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or let it go one or the other 
 What is your situation
 that's very interesting
 Your concern on the economy was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on Puerto Rico or pressures on the U S in terms of aid
 or 
 Uh-huh
 I guess we're assuming that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than say Mississippi 
 or 
 Okay 
 that's something that I guess I have not much of an image of other than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a in a carefree sense I guess 
 Although I'm aware of the political problems and unrest and also difficulties they have I don't know whether statehood would improve their economy 
 I don't know that the act of being a state would have any impact on them
 I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now 
 But of course if their economy is weak there is not much of a base on which to tax 
 I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being since they aren't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be 
 How do you feel though about 
 well I guess it's to their advantage to be a territory 
 but I wonder how having been in a territory but only as a young student 
 and my parents were in the military at the time 
 so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in Alaska at the time since they voted absentee
 I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a feeling of second class citizenry to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote
 The District of Columbia people for instance are quite frustrated I think at times in their not having a Senate representative
 Uh-huh
 I see what you mean 
 so that 
 Yeah 
 taxes would undoubtedly be occurring 
 there 
 I don't know I don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation 
 frequently the laws in a territory are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states
 I 
 and I'm thinking in terms of education 
 But then again each state sets its own 
 and I don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico 
 it's interesting because I haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to economy I had thought of it more in terms of political realization 
 and I guess I had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the U S than an independent country 
 so 
 Uh-huh 
 well that's interesting too 
 Well it sounds as though you are in favor of status quo
 And I think having listened to you relative to the economy thing I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these 
 So [ I'm ul- I guess I'm ultimately ] in favor of status quo also at this point leaning towards the statehood
 I think I would be troubled 
 I believe that any of our states 
 and I 
 constitutionally I don't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something 
 I don't think there is any prohibitions 
 I would be bothered by that 
 I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America's strengths 
 and that's the melting pot
 I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines 
 but I'm troubled by too close a clinging to the past 
 and I'm also realizing that a common language I think is the ultimate bond of a country
 And Canada I guess comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever 
 that I think that would be a negative step to make 
 and I think that that they would need to reassess that 
 I'm troubled even in by bilingualism in so far that it gets in the way of the melting pot aspect
 
 Yeah 
 but I'm rather in favor of people being bilingual
 and I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language
 But I'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level
 I'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess
 Well I think we have gone to time 
 and I appreciate your having called
 Good-bye
