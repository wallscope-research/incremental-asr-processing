 Okay well 
 I was thinking about it for a long time 
 and I like basically almost every form of music and type of music 
 I don't have a whole lot of dislikes 
 I like jazz especially the blues 
 and I like a lot of of course the classics everything back from Bach and Beethoven and Chopin and just in general everything
 I enjoy a lot of the modern forms 
 Right 
 right
 well that gets 
 some of the punk when I was in high school that was one of the big things was punk music 
 and or some of it has a lot to say the lyrics do 
 but the actual 
 well it really expresses some of the opinions of the people who enjoy the music
 but as far as a musical art form I just don't see a whole lot of art to it 
 
 some of it 
 it depends 
 the two types of rap or I enjoy to listen to and one is the rap that is just funny 
 and they usually do a lot of satire
 
 Right
 Right 
 the monotonous 
 no 
 that's not 
 I don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about well I'm better than you and blah blah blah 
 I don't like that 
 I like the funny satire 
 and then some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in urban society 
 It really does 
 It talks about race relations and police relations 
 and that 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's about my opinion of that 
 it's okay 
 The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it
 one country and western song sounds like every other country and western
 and so the musicians don't get to really get into their music 
 They just play a certain number of chords
 the drummer plays a certain beat 
 and you have a country and western song
 and 
 Right
 Yeah 
 And I can't say that I like a lot of the very modern rock and roll 
 but I really enjoy the fifties the sixties and some of the seventies rock and roll
 and I really enjoy especially the sixties
