 Okay 
 do you participate in family reunions
 Uh-huh
 Did you 
 were they far away 
 were they close
 Uh-huh
 how neat
 Uh-huh
 that would be fun
 Yeah 
 well we have a family reunion on my mother's side of the family that's 
 it started probably about forty years ago because I remember going as a teenager before I was ever married 
 and then my husband and I went while we were still dating 
 and it's still going on 
 and it used to be held at Lake Brownwood down at Brownwood Texas 
 but now we hold it at Lake Texoma so that the Oklahoma group doesn't have to drive as far
 And we have had as many on a Saturday night 
 it starts on Friday and goes through Sunday 
 and we've had as many on a Saturday night as about two hundred and fifty
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 and we took 
 our family all brought in food and everything
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Well I know on Sundays we all elect now to chip in 
 and we go get Kentucky Fried Chicken and bring out 
 but we kind of take our food for three days 
 and now our grandchildren are participating in it 
 and just love that they have all this little batch of cousins that they get to see about once a year 
 enthused and with it 
 and our children you know thoroughly enjoy it
 So it's been kind of nice 
 It started out when I was a youngster and watching my mother 
 Now I'm to the mother was 
 and I am now the older generation and doing more of the cooking and watching my daughter you know more and everything 
 and 
 my word
 uh-huh
 are they
 Get together any more
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 I do think now we have noticed a waning of interest
 and as parents get older and start dying off I think sometimes it is hard to keep the interest going
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 you probably do good just to get your immediate family together
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 they're a lot of fun 
 Well my si- 
 I have a sister 
 and then we have a son and a daughter 
 and we have three grandchildren
 and our son and daughter are both married 
 and our son's not as interested in it as our daughter 
 but our daughter is really interested 
 And 
 I beg you pardon
 a little bit 
 I wish that our son was you know 
 but the cousins are closer to our daughter's age than to our son's and just totally different interest group 
 and plus 
 and he's newly married and doesn't have children
 and you know I'm hoping that as they you know are married a little bit longer and have children that they may be more inclined to want to go you know to it 
 I know that
 Well talk to them about it and you know tell them some of the things we're doing 
 Now when he was a preteen you know when he was like ten or twelve he loved going 
 he had another cousin he was close to and went 
 but that cousin kind of quit going 
 and as he got to be a teenager he wasn't quite as interested 
 He was more interested in rock and roll 
 and this is more country western group
 and just lack of interest
