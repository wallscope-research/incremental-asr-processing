 Okay 
 I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement You know not to get like in a dead end job
 And plus for me it's I mean like medical and you know benefits and dental
 They're also important
 
 
 Are they like pretty much train for a specific job 
 and that what I hired for and then just very little variation from that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well you know that's interesting though 
 Because I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore 
 I use to think that you know after you work 
 you mean job security 
 that use to be I think a couple of years ago 
 but I don't know if it is so much anymore 
 In fact we just had a lay off in what November I guess
 But it wasn't necessarily 
 I mean you know some people had been there a long time
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 No doubt 
 yeah
 Expedient 
 yeah 
 that's exactly it 
 Yeah 
 where you know it cuts back the most
 Oh 
 Oh 
 See yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that's one of the things too 
 You get too many management people you know
 Yeah 
 and it's very easy for them to say this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know
 And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time 
 Well those people aren't there anymore
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 but 
 so what else do you think is important
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I think probably in a small 
 yeah 
 I was going to say it's more personal for one thing 
 You probably have a better team cooperation or team playing atmosphere
 Probably where as in a bigger corporation I think you're just a number you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 whereas yeah in a smaller 
 I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished you know
 Uh-huh
