 What do you think about the Peace Corps or public service commitment
 Well I think it was thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft 
 and people said well young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country 
 but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from some sort of public service like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or various other things of that sort 
 And it seems to me that it's not a totally bad idea 
 but I don't quite see how they'd make it work
 How would they decide who goes into building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who goes to Saudi Arabia
 Yeah 
 the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary
 And the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be like a draft
 And some people would get military service 
 and some people would get civilian service like working in hospitals 
 This 
 I assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the Army 
 they were allowed to do hospital service or things like that 
 and if they re- 
 or farm work in World War One I remember reading about 
 and I suppose that there is justification for taking everybody if you take anybody
 But I just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them sorting them out assigning them training them would be insurmountable
 Yeah 
 well it's a possibility
 Well I think that in the cases like that they had to be pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war 
 It was something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life
 yeah
 Sure 
 and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something for their room and board 
 and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend even if it's like the Peace Corps where they don't get most of it until they come home you have to pay them something
 yeah
 Yeah
 Now I had a lot of friends who went to the Peace Corps back in the mid sixties
 and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization 
 but on the other hand I'm not sure what the permanent value of it was 
 I don't know what we got for all the money 
 We had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to what was then East Pakistan is now Bangladesh and to Algeria and to Southeast Asia and lots of out-of-the-way places 
 But I don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 And it was definitely voluntary too 
 They were not drafting you and sending you against your will
 Yeah 
 Well what about a voluntary program 
 Do you think that would be a good idea
 I don't either
 Yeah 
 out here in California there's a program like that for juvenile delinquents the ones that are not dangerous 
 and they don't have to be locked up go to these camps 
 And they do forestry work 
 They maintain trails 
 and they put up signs 
 and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort
 And that I know is run by the State 
 but there may be other things 
 I'm not so sure what kind of training that is for the future for those kids
 It's probably a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble 
 but whether it's something that they can put to economic use later on is a different subject
 That's true 
 Good point 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I'm sorry 
 I'm going to have to go 
 but my other line is blinking
 But it was good to talk to you
