 in the Houston area
 that's great
 we are too 
 Our community is just starting to get organized about it 
 They just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our things and dump them off ourselves
 And it 
 Uh-huh
 I think that's great 
 There's a few places in Houston where they're trying that out 
 I don't know if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded bags and bins
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 that's great
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 we're all for it 
 Our 
 we've got several bins in our garage where we you know sort things out and take it to the appropriate places
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 it does 
 It does 
 But I'm sure that they can find some sort of use for them if you know you know there 
 I've seen talk about using garbage for energy
 And so you know you could also apply the magazines toward that
 Yes
 I know it
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh
 that's great
 Right 
 well that's a great idea 
 I wish we were that involved in or that our city was that involved in recycling like that 
 because you know I've talked to many people 
 and we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it 
 Yeah 
 yeah You know 
 and I don't mind you know 
 at first it was the little extra money that you got you know returning the cans in and stuff like that
 But now you know I don't mind as long as things are getting recycled you know that we don't get reimbursed
 Uh-huh
 I know it
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yes 
 plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also
 We have 
 I know the one that we use has recycling for the bags
 and they're promoting the cloth bags You know the reusable cloth bags
 that's great
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 I understand 
 my husband about once a weekend he'll go to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out
 And he'll go pick them up because he just can't stand that 
 he 
 And it's so you know 
 we have all our piles of recyclables also
 I remember at Christmas the only thing that I'm 
 when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did that was they provided a place for us to take our Christmas trees for them to mulch for city use
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well that sounds like you all really have a great system worked out there
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Well see that's one 
 Well the 
 but something does need to be done about the Styrofoam that 
 yeah 
 I mean they don't 
 No
 Right 
 And I've seen where some places have taken a plastic and they're recycling them into other plastics And the Styrofoam also into insulation and things like that 
 and I think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I was thinking about you know like the Styrofoam used at the fast-food restaurants that if everybody 
 and so 
 yeah 
 I know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of Styrofoam 
 but 
 
 Well that's good 
 That's a 
 they should last awhile 
 I believe we are 
 I have to believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening
 And so it will be good in the long run 
 Well I enjoyed it
