 Okay 
 so do you have any favorite teams
 I was going to say you played pro ball
 right
 Not quite 
 Oh
 Yes 
 I'm actually a Met 
 I'm one of these people who's actually a die hard Mets fan and an avid Yankee hater
 Yeah 
 it's 
 I find it very strange 
 more people 
 you know real Met fans don't like the Yankees
 and real Yankee fans don't like the Mets for some reason
 I never quite found a New York fan
 I always found a fan you know of either one or the other 
 and so that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox by default because I went to college also in Boston
 Oh
 Yeah 
 so that's sort of close enough
 so you were pretty close 
 Well I don't know there's a part of me that says that you know I'm sort of glad Strawberry went away
 You know when he sort of went away I started thinking yeah well he was performing fairly well 
 but he really wasn't worth the baggage you know
 I think they're okay 
 I think they're 
 you know I think they have enough people who are still in their prime you know
 I mean certainly if you look at them compared to let's say you know eight years ago or something you know they're sort of in good standing whereas you know <> I certainly don't think they're the eighty-six team any more
 Yeah 
 I 
 Right 
 they beat Houston in extra innings 
 and then they actually won the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route against Boston when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner 
 I felt real bad about that 
 but hey what can you do
 That's right 
 well actually he was supposedly 
 there was something wrong with him at the time 
 and I 
 Right 
 and I understand that 
 and I say Hey if the guy can't play you don't blame that 
 hit it to him 
 you blame the team you know for putting him in
 That's right 
 so 
 So I was in school at Boston at the time
 So I 
 it was actually wonderful because where I was they were half Met fans and half Sox fans
 Oh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well I guess they must have been scared after the 
 Well that's good 
 well they're Brooklyn boys I guess
 You don't expect them to be much of anything but thugs 
 I know I was born there 
 Yeah 
 I was also born in Brooklyn
 so I can call myself a Brooklyn thug although I'm really not
 Yeah
 Well that's 
 actually I think I make something because I think 
 and in as much as sort of fan support helps
 You know it's good to have 
 Yes 
 it is kind of small
 Right
 that's great 
 So 
 Yeah 
 that'll be nice 
 I mean that I think tends to keep 
 I think stadiums work tend to keep people happy
 Yeah 
 exactly
 I haven't been to any Toronto games yet 
 But 
 Of stadiums yeah 
 well I mean to get up there 
 I mean the best I've been up here so far you know in up state New York is is Rochester Red Wings game
 Cornell is in Ithaca
 yeah 
 so Cornell is about somewhere about two and a half hours south and east of us
 So if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of 
 Yeah 
 we're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario
 Actually whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn't be a port city
 but they 
 really I hadn't actually known that
 Well but we have our own triple A team here
 the Redwings they're a farm team for the Orioles
 So everybody hopes that they go all the way around here 
 There's the 
 they're the big team in Rochester
 yeah 
 I 
 actually we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they're fun
 Lots of really big 
 you know lots of local fans you know small stadium you know 
 and they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes you know
 especially 
 you know I'll make a day game or something 
 But they really seem to 
 people really get into it 
 I mean [ again I can't make any predictions about them 
 but I suspect they'll go they'll go fly Yeah 
 I think those are more fun than major league games sometimes
 Yes 
 it's true
 One of the advantages of not having pitchers who are 
 you know I guess when you start pitching real well well move them up Bam 
 Yeah 
 but 
 Well the way I see it is 
 I mean you know I can use a Met analogy here
 If you'll think back a few years to when the Mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren't very sort of well trained
 you know back to you know maybe eighty eighty-four or eighty-three or eighty-five you know when they weren't quite the eighty-six team that they were
 I 
 that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year [ I think + if I think + the young talent really just has to build itself up
 Right 
 but 
 that must be nice
 Well that isn't too bad Just a couple of hours
 Yeah 
 well it takes me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium
 So I don't know
 Yeah 
 well actually I can take a highway the whole way down 
 but it's almost four hundred hou- 
 I mean I mean it's almost four hundred 
 you know barring traffic it's four hundred hours 
 I mean four hundred mil- 
 four hundred hours 
 right 
 four hundred miles barring traffic 
 so you know it's a heck of a drive 
 We are substantially north of New York enough that we don't get to go play too often
 Toronto
 Toronto's only about two hours 
 yeah
 Toronto I mean I want to go see
 I can 
 actually I've driven 
 but I've heard about the ferry as well
 Haven't taken it yet though 
 Have you taken it
 Yeah 
 I really love 
 I think that's one of the most enjoyable things about being up here 
 I'm only up here for school
 no 
 probably south maybe Texas 
 Some place south and warm 
 I don't 
 I'm not a big cold fan
 right now we're actually having 
 it's getting nice 
 I mean it was in the high fifties today 
 but three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm 
 that's great 
 You know about that same time branches were falling off everywhere 
 and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks
 Because it didn't make the national news too much which I find really weird
 but we were I mean 
 you know all schools were closed for a week
 There were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive
 Yeah 
 because they had so many power lines down
 and so many things like that 
 so they were
