 Well we really like the Mexican food you know here in Texas
 so we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying them out 
 and so Tia's is probably our favorite restaurant there 
 and I think they have one of the best services that we really like it
 No 
 Where's that at
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Really
 that 
 no 
 we haven't explored you know too many places 
 you know lot of the big name brand I guess chains
 yeah 
 but we've tried places you know down by the Collin Creek Mall 
 the you know Alvarez 
 and we tried what was across the street El Paso's El Chico's or something 
 yeah 
 something like that 
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 yes
 Yes
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 I know 
 I tell you what 
 they're excellent food 
 I wish I could make them here at home
 Just can't make those flour tortillas 
 But 
 Well I love seafood
 and I notice they have like you know The Louisiana Purchase 
 Razzoo's has opened up down you know close to six thirty-five
 Yes 
 I have eaten there 
 Now the only problem 
 *[[note the setup for a negative comment]] I love the food 
 It's a lot of cajun food and good seafood 
 but the service has always been so strange every time I've been in there 
 Mostly it's been at lunch time
 but I hear at night though they have you know the outdoor bar 
 and that's it's really you know kind of lively
 So it's really good All their blackened grill stuff
 Uh-huh
 well that sounds great
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 well I have children and work 
 and so we can eat a lot of fast food 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I know
 I know 
 I'm so sick of McDonalds
 and we used to eat there all the time 
 And so now we branch out at this Wendy's or some other fast food joint
 and cheap too
 Yeah 
 but the kids they've got those expensive tastes 
 so they like Tia's 
 so they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff
 Yeah 
 I know 
 they're just spoiled rotten 
 but no 
 we love to eat out 
 of course it's just so much easier and simpler
 yeah 
 So we usually eat out generally two or three times a week
 Yeah 
 yeah
 me too 
 me too 
 So I know that you know I just work 
 and I'm just tired when I get home 
 and I just don't feel like cooking
 And you know on the weekends there's always things to do 
 so we like to go out to lunch on Saturdays especially
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 now we've been there twice and both times the food just didn't quite settle with me
 and I don't know what it was
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yes 
 and I love 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 family restaurant
 Uh-huh
 Now I haven't been there befo- 
 I went to one I think in Ohio or somewhere up there 
 but I've never been to that one here 
 I know it's just down the street
 So Now have you been to Applebee's
 Yes
 Yes 
 I really like that too 
 so that was 
 Oh
 I've been there twice 
 uh-huh 
 yeah 
 so 
 Salad bar 
 yes
