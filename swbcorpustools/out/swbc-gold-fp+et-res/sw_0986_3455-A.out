 Okay 
 I guess our topic is about movies
 and what is coincidence 
 we got a baby-sitter 
 and we went to the movies that past weekend
 And we saw CAPE FEAR
 It is
 It's really good
 how was that
 I heard that's a movie that you really can't take children 
 Is that true 
 Oh
 Oh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 because the little boy dies
 Yeah
 Oh
 Oh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 I want to see that one
 Well CAPE FEAR was more suspenseful
 It was really suspenseful 
 So that's a real good movie to see
 no 
 and it was kind of 
 I don't know 
 it's kind of both I guess 
 but it's not as bad as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
 But it's just as suspenseful I think
 And it was a real good movie 
 And then we saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST Because we have two kids And FIEVEL GOES WEST 
 But those were okay 
 And then boy it's been so long since we've been to the movies 
 but we've rented some videos
 And I think the last one I rented was MORTAL THOUGHTS with Demi Moore
 And that's okay 
 That's pretty good
 and WHAT ABOUT BOB
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we rented that one
 And I guess that's about it 
 Have you rented any movies lately
 yeah 
 that was good 
 We rented that one too
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 So do you go to the movies often 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well we have two little kids 
 so it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies 
 We have to dig up a baby-sitter 
 And that's only the only time we can go out 
 so our time is scarce
 But we're big movie people 
 and we try and do 
 and I don't know about the last movie I've seen on T V that was real good 
 yeah 
 Bertinelli or what's her name
 I can't 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 that was real good 
 I saw that two part series 
 and I heard it was a true story
 Yeah 
 I think that was probably the last movie I've seen too
 and then I saw that other movie about MOTHER WIFE MURDERER 
 Did you see that one
 Yeah
 Did you see that one 
 that was really good 
 That was supposed to be a true story too
 Yeah
 Guess a couple weeks ago or something like that
 Boy we see all the same movies
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I know
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well We sure do have a lot in common
 If you're ever in town we'll go see a movie 
 and we don't really 
 do you all still have drive-ins up there 
 or 
 well we may have just a couple over here
