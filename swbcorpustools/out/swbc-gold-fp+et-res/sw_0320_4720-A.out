 I think actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have working for a large corporation 
 And for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit 
 I think it's health care 
 It's what 
 I think everybody would say that
 Right 
 belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you 
 the 
 sometimes I think it's more important than salary
 Yes 
 And I don't know if I would rank that second 
 but since I have three boys it can turn out to be important 
 Yeah 
 you know 
 in a given year dental expenses can really kill you
 Right
 Right 
 It's 
 Right 
 and then if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodony will
 I guess that would be up there 
 I'm not sure how I would rank that say compared to retirement 
 or pretax savings was another thing that I think is a great benefit 
 And I think it's really something that the government ought to encourage more because there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in Germany and Japan 
 Right 
 when you have the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has you can offer some incentive 
 and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up the savings that you wouldn't otherwise do 
 and 
 Leave
 You know I don't think so yet 
 They may have just plain parental leave which either one can take
 I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short 
 I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks
 Right 
 and 
 There 
 There ought to be some compromise where the person would be guaranteed a career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position in exchange for a longer period of time
 it's so important to families then 
 and yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up
 
 That 
 Yeah 
 you're right 
 I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I would most like to see changed the parental leave
 Right 
 Right 
 They do it by shortchanging their kids 
 There's no other way I mean unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely 
 people moving as much 
 And it's just a terrible choice 
 you shouldn't have to make it
 you're right
 And 
 right 
 Boy 
 would I like to have that 
 Yeah
 listen I have friends in a lot of different cities 
 If you just fly me there 
 I'll take care of that 
 Right 
 and I guess the
