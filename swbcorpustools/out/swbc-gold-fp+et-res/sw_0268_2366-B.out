 When you say that you grew up in the sixties I take it that was the teenage type years 
 or 
 Okay 
 we're very similarly aged 
 so we probably have an interesting perspective on the music on the times 
 so I'm just a couple years older than you
 essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that for one reason or another I didn't pay much attention to music 
 but as I look back now I realize it was very formative for me 
 my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel whom I saw perform when I was in college 
 and I became attached to that style of urban country if there is such a thing
 I think in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend to have a dramatic or story approach to their music usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it 
 over time I became very interested in baroque classical 
 and I think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found it very relaxing for me 
 My tastes now run I guess to a upbeat Simon 
 it's something that interests me combined with the classical tastes I had mentioned 
 And my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds early eighteen hundred music 
 I'm not a music 
 I'm not particularly schooled in it 
 I know what I like to listen to as far as classical music 
 And I spent a good deal of time listening also to people from the late seventies really Neil Diamond for instance people of that particular time
 I listen to some country and western 
 but I'm not schooled in it 
 and I've enjoyed the times when I have listened to it 
 I played a little bit of piano 
 I continue to do that 
 I want to do it 
 and I never have the discipline to stay with it 
 but when I do play and begin to reacquire skills I inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a new piano player
 Right
 Right
 I find it very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy I particularly like the music 
 I don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation 
 a good example would be 
 I have connections but not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations
 and I found that I really like CHINA BEACH 
 and I particularly like TOUR OF DUTY 
 and both of them I had as much fascination of the background music I think going on as I did to the theme of the shows
 and I I've THIRTY SOMETHING I'm particularly interested 
 but it's the music almost that I find myself listening to 
 That could well be 
 I spent my and sophomore and junior year in college when I 
 a song by the 
 I think the title of it was just Downtown
 and if you recall how it goes downtown ta da da da 
 all I have to do is hear that song and I get strongly evoked memories of difficult times in school being behind on work
 and my family now knows if they come into my study and I happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe I'm trying to get a project done at school and I'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away
 They can hear the unconscious music signal behind it
 that's right
 probably about first grade
 and I have returned about every four or five years to thinking that I would like to do something about it 
 I usually get to the point where I can play some of my favorite themes 
 and then inevitably I am swept away by the pressure of other types of things
 
 It is 
 In order to continue to grow and 
 I always think that I'll be able to do it 
 and then I inevitably discover that I have no innate music talent relative to composition and that I struggle and really can't quite understand what is that other people take for granted in composition themes 
 and I 
 keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang on them 
 I have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved
 but in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude 
 and I keep thinking gee I thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand 
 but it doesn't for me
 Uh-huh
 
 So we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance 
 That's the most fascinating thing 
 And you sir
 take care
 Okay 
 Good-bye
