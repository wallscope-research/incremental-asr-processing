 What's the topic
 Okay
 You bet
 I'll let you lead out
 I'll let you lead out
 I think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that they seem to be economically driven also
 So if you look at Russia and what's happened over there I think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing 
 And of course I look at the economic problems in the United States right now 
 One of the things you wonder is what that's going to do to us
 I think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things I mean I think it's great to even have three or four different careers in your life 
 I think it must have been terribly boring to go through your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years
 Some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that aspects changing
 And the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good 
 but the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs 
 I think it's great
 yeah
 I think one of the problems with education as it relates to this though is that I don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes
 It just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which I think is going to be a hard thing for people to face
 Yeah
 There probably needs to be some training on how to adjust to these changes as they come about 
 I mean if you look at the high unemployment rate right now 
 and you look at people who are in those situations I don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them even ideas of how to make those changes now 
 So it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them
 Uh-huh
