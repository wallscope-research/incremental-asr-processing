 Well 
 well my favorite well 
 I don't really have a favorite 
 I like everything basically 
 I guess if I had to pick it would be like pop I would think 
 but I like everything 
 So it's kind of hard to choose sometimes
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 I grew up next door to the Richardson Symphony Orchestra leader 
 so 
 Yeah
 So we used to go and listen to them all the time 
 and my parents still do
 So I grew up with a lot of his music and what not 
 Plus my parents are well 
 especially my dad likes a lot of classical music 
 and he introduced my brother and I both to a lot of it 
 So 
 Yeah
 Sure did
 Yeah 
 We all went to high school together 
 and we're still in contact with each other
 We all go back to parents' houses on the weekends and what not 
 so 
 really
 It is a small world isn't it
 Yeah 
 he's a pretty nice guy
 Yeah 
 well I had to work for him 
 and I never would want to work for him 
 So 
 Yeah 
 he sure is 
 he just became a grandfather
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 they just had the baby's christening 
 so 
 It was really nice so <>
 He's a little boy 
 I can't 
 it's a 
 gosh 
 it's like Elijah or something like that
 I keep forgetting what she named him
 His middle name is Chris or Christopher for her daddy 
 but I think it's Elijah 
 It starts with an E
 I can't remember 
 Yes
 Yeah 
 we've heard them and liked it real well of course 
 actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord
 I really like those 
 in fact I had a harpsichord played at my wedding
 Yeah
 Which was real nice 
 I got married during the Christmas season 
 and we played old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not 
 and it was real nice 
 I liked that a lot
 I liked the sound of the harpsichord
 No 
 somebody played it 
 No 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 Just by itself 
 just by itself
 It was real nice
 Yeah 
 It went well 
 it was a change you know from your traditional normal you know stuff since it was Christmas time and we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias and you know stuff like that 
 and so we did the harpsichord with old-time traditional Christmas carols 
 not you know the bouncy you know sing along kind but some of the older ones that 
 some I don't even I recognize the melodies and whatnot 
 but I didn't recognize the name
 So it was real nice
 
 Uh-huh
 It does 
 It really does 
 and it has such a different sound to it anyway 
 It's almost 
 I don't know the way it vibrates 
 it's kind of haunting you know on some of the notes 
 it's 
 I like it
 I don't know how else to explain 
 But we've got friends that are in the music business that go around Dallas 
 they're called Odessa 
 It's a husband and wife team that we've known for years 
 and we try to make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff too 
 so we've had a lot of stuff you know friends and things to do with music that constant 
 plus my husband's real big into music too 
 so He doesn't play anything 
 but he just likes to listen 
 And my dad and 
 my kids are now well 
 my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast 
 and 
 Yeah 
 well my oldest is only nine
 So he hasn't really gotten into that yet 
 They have choir that they go to you know music class that they go to 
 but he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet
 So 
 I think that starts in sixth grade
 So 
 but I don't know 
 the only thing he's shown interest in wanting to play is the drums 
 cause my brother plays 
 and I don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not you know 
 it's just one of those things I'm just going to wait and see if he's interested in something you know
 Yeah 
 just a little bit 
 
 Really
 Yeah
 I don't know if any of mine will be interested in it 
 or
