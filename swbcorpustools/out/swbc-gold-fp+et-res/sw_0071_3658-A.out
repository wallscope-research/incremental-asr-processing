 Okay
 That's right
 What would we like to say 
 I think 
 Uh-huh
 I think that's what the subject is about
 In the MORNING TIMES 
 I guess I did not
 Well it's been interesting that we 
 Yes 
 So we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them on polls will say that they think that everyone has a right to health care
 And yet I don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it
 Which is why people are talking about 
 we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair
 You have health insurance
 Through your company
 my goodness
 That's must have been hard 
 How was your care at Parkland
 But yet Parkland is not free either
 Is it affordable
 So you did have a good experience
 Is your wife better I hope
 I'm real sorry
 Sure
 *[[listen; is this a question]] It does happen 
 but it's very sad
 Well so am I
 Actually I'm a pediatrician
 and I feel very strongly about children and developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year Where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most 
 So I'm really quite active in trying to be proactive at least for children's issues 
 It's very complicated 
 but I strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization glasses hearing aids basic health benefits
 
 Well and so much has gone up so much 
 The cost of immunizations for example and just the legal benefits 
 that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily et cetera
 So well I don't know 
 it is interesting 
 in case you didn't know Texas leads the nation in uninsured children 
 Thirty-one percent of all Texas children do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid 
 So one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care 
 And I work in the children's Parkland system 
 and it's pretty overwhelming to me
 But it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county
