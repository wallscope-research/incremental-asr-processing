 Okay 
 I don't 
 do you have an opinion on that on the U S R
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 <> Uh-huh 
 Sure
 Sure
 Sure 
 that happens
 Uh-huh
 Sure 
 I guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot go into a war 
 they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together 
 but I could not foresee them severing what they have with the U S because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation 
 from what I've been hearing is the U S S R has been almost bankrupt for years
 and it's people are desperate 
 and there might be a revolution within the people 
 But I don't think the U S would get involved with it because there's too close of ties to where I think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change and that we cannot run them like we run the U S and that they have to make their own independent decision 
 So I guess I really have no fear at all of the U S S R verses 
 you get these small little places like Iraq and all of that that might be something that I'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons verses or as big country of U S S R 
 I have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them you know it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time
 So I mean sure 
 they have weapons to kill us over and over and over 
 but to them that would be a suicide 
 and they 
 and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people 
 But if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of you know doing whatever for their country they'll do it 
 Sure
 Sure Uh-huh 
 sure 
 I have a daughter that's frustrated 
 She's on a stool that she can get up on 
 but i- 
 if she can't get down on it it's like get me down right now 
 But anyway it was really good talking to you 
 and you have a good weekend
 Uh-huh 
 Thank you 
 Bye now
