 I guess we're recorded 
 What 
 do you have any hobbies that you like to do
 
 All right 
 that's an interesting assortment
 My husband is into cycling 
 In fact he's out there right now before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the time
 do you do any handicraft type things I think was the question
 Yeah 
 whittling or 
 Nothing like that
 I do some things 
 I've gotten into 
 I like to decorate things 
 and I do sweatshirts and T-shirts 
 and I've gotten to where I have started selling them at craft shows and things
 and I have done fairly well at them 
 I've had 
 a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed 
 but most of them have worked out pretty good 
 Oh
 Yeah 
 what does a computer club do 
 I didn't know there were such things
 Uh-huh
 you're not into hacking or whatever 
 Uh-huh
 Well that's kind of interesting hobby 
 What else did you 
 you said you did cycling
 What was the other thing
 Backpacking 
 We 
 Uh-huh
 Well we have done that 
 our two older boys were in Boy Scouts 
 and my daughter was in Girl Scouts until just about a year ago
 so we've done a fair amount of that in our spare time also 
 But it 
 I 
 that's a great thing to do you know really 
 Have you been backpacking anyplace exciting
 
 Uh-huh

 Okay 
 To the 
 by Fort Sill there
 Uh-huh
 Have you gone like to Fillmont with the Boy Scouts
 I've always thought that would be a real fun thing to do
 Uh-huh

 like know for a vacation you'd go backpacking
 okay 
 [ You just 
 and you volunteer for the Boy Scouts 
 Uh-huh 
 Well sometimes 
 Sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea 
 Have

 do you ever you know just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I 
 probably 
 probably 
 That's 
 well my other things that I like to do in my spare time I like swimming
 Which is in now 
 I've done that 
 and I also 
 when I like something I usually try to figure out how to make money off of it
