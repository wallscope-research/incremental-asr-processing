 Okay 
 let's talk about schooling
 Okay 
 well I have a boy 
 and he just went into middle school 
 and I have a girl 
 and she's in grade school 
 and then I have a little boy who goes to 
 they have something just before kindergarten 
 and it's called Early Childhood 
 and I have a young boy in that
 So I have a lot of children in the school system down here
 And I think we have excellent teachers here 
 I am really 
 like the way the teachers work with the students 
 I've not been so happy with the schools themselves I guess 
 Like last year my son and daughter were in the same grade school before he moved up to middle school 
 and it was just packed 
 I mean it was a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents
 And it was just a real problem 
 so we had to do a bond issue and vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that's what the prefer to do or to work for another school to be built which is a good idea 
 but in the meantime the school still has lots and lots of kids in it
 So I think one thing is that would 
 maybe we don't have enough schools 
 and secondly when we have enough schools sometimes we can't get the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 great
 We see through out the country
 Uh-huh
 I think that's right
 Yeah 
 The home 
 yeah
 I think that's right
 It is so hard with a family system either divorced or just one parent or just li- 
 and then if both of them have to work even that is a hard situation for the children to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them
 and I think it's real important that the parents work with the school 
 I think what you said is really a pinpoint though that the student and the family life really adds or detracts what's happening in the school
 so what about your wife 
 is she happy at school 
 or 
 I bet she does
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
