 are you working right now
 
 what kind of work do you do
 <> Uh-huh
 Oh
 Wh- 
 is that how you heard about this thing 
 
 Uh-huh 
 Me too 
 I work at the Georgia Tech Research Institute
 I'm a co-op student 
 so I work and go to school about halftime 
 And I really don't have any job benefits to speak of 
 We're kind of 
 I don't know 
 they just kind of forget us on that end 
 We don't really have any vacation or you know sick days or health care or anything really 
 so 
 Exactly 
 Exactly
 What about you
 
 Yeah 
 they do that I think if you're research here 
 then I know of some of the people that have gotten their masters 
 and I think that they might you know pay for that Pay for the classes and stuff 
 but I know they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage 
 You know they'll let you work halftime if you want to finish
 you want to 
 Yeah 
 They'll let you work decrease your number of hours by any percentage just about so if you want to get your masters 
 and then I think of course with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due 
 so that will probably help out 
 But Do you get any kind of health care type stuff
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I think I mean that's a pretty important part of it there because that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems 
 I think my 
 I'm still covered with my dad's health plan where he works 
 but it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own
 Uh-huh
 They have
 Well I guess the only real benefit I guess you could say working here besides I mean 
 I'm learning and stuff because I'm you know in school 
 But there's some weird law where student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax
 Though that's about five percent right there 
 so 
 That's about the only real bonus
 so I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid real you know because if I was working somewhere else I'd have to you know pay an extra five percent or so 
 
 Yeah
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 help a lot
 Yeah 
 See around here it's like 
 we pretty much work from project to project well you know with different sponsors
 there is not a whole lot of you know funded research from
