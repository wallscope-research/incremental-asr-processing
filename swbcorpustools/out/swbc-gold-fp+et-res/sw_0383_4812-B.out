 I don't see any problem with testing for random drugs
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well I'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon 
 And I just came from Saint Paul interviewing with Three M
 And they have a policy for testing 
 if they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start
 And I guess the only drawback I can see to drug testing is in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem 
 But i- 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Right
 electrical engineering
 wow 
 They test you before you start or before you even interview 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 what happens if you were to fail 
 Then do they give you like one more chance or two more chances 
 Uh-huh
 no
 I'm just about to finish my Master's in May and just interviewing with companies right now
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 do they test you right now at work too
 Okay 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Wow 
 Is it formal policy that they said they might test
