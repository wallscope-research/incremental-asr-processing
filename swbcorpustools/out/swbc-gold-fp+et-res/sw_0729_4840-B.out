 Well let's see 
 I haven't got mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at home in the Bay area
 So I'm not sure how much I'm getting back 
 but I'm pretty sure I should get back a little bit since student 
 so 
 It's not too much
 Not too bad though 
 Yeah 
 it's one of those necessities of life that we all have to you know pay taxes although it is kind of a pain sometimes though
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and like as time goes on you know things get more expensive 
 and because we were increasingly complex society that day by day things get more expensive as well as more complex
 And you know taxes are one of the ways to help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society
 I mean everything you know from medicare to social security to you know feeding the homeless to maintaining prisons to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that 
 And it's 
 now there's more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing 
 And you know it's becoming a larger responsibility 
 but someone has to pay for it 
 and that's us
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 and even today it's like the amount of taxes that you know we're paying for 
 But you'd think that we're still in that 
 this deficit state that 
 *[[ Bad parsing Seems to be part of previous utterance ]] we're still not able to pay off things just because the budget's not big enough as it is
 And makes you wonder when there's you know countries out there that have you know tax rates of like close to fifty percent or higher
 You know it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you even get it
 And that's kind of a scary thought 
 I hope it doesn't come down to that
 But on the other hand while those countries that have high taxes also have things like socialized medicine things like that too which are nice fringe benefits of it 
 So everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors That sort of thing
 And it's good 
 but it's the price they pay 
 I mean it can be argued one way or another whether economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those countries tend to have a much slower cash flow and don't generate a large amount of revenue because there's so little currency flow through out the economic system 
 Well just keeping up with the times that's all 
 as it turns out you know it's one of those interests you know I kind of like to keep up on 
 Because well it's nice to know that when you know I do start working that I like to know where my tax dollars are going too
 work hard to get you know 
 I like to know where it's going to
 Uh-huh
 I think in a way it's good in a way it's not 
 but I think in general it's probably good 
 I mean a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that in the past have been not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against the taxes for them Sponsored by the alcohol and tobacco companies 
 And things like tobacco they're a proven health hazard to smokers as well as nonsmokers 
 And it's 
 as far as the safety thing in San Luis Obispo for example there's an ordnance which states that there's no smoking in any public areas 
 *[[typo ordinance]] And so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere
