 Very good 
 discussion on child care 
 they're all grown up
 well you know all about it then
 It's been quite a few years 
 I have grandchildren but haven't really been into selecting child care for them
 so 
 And it's been quite a few years since I've had to think about that
 No 
 my daughter that has three stays home with her children 
 and one of my daughters has one 
 but an aunt keeps the baby
 But I would not really know how to go about selecting one nowadays 
 but I would imagine it's very hard
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 well that's good
 I've always thought you know it would be really tough 
 What if you had a fire or something with babies
 You would have to be able to have enough 
 you know you'd have to be able to get them all out
 Uh-huh
 well that's a 
 I hadn't thought about that 
 But I was thinking my gosh if they had very many babies they couldn't possibly get them all out
 But you could put them in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out I guess
 
 well that's neat
 Well do most of your day-care workers really care about the children 
 or is it just a job for them
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 how old are the children go with this center where you work
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 You've got the little bitty ones
 Those are the probably the best group to have
 And they're fun
 Babies are fun 
 and they're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Do you think there's very many really good day-care centers around your area
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sometimes it's a have to
 I hear a lot of the girls I work with constantly 
 I wish I could find someplace I really felt good about You know
 Most of them don't really feel that it's a great place to leave their kids
 And it's really bad you know 
 One of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place 
 and then they called her one afternoon and said well we thought we'd better call and tell you before you got over here 
 Lacy fell asleep on the bus after our field trip today 
 and we just now found her
 They had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon
 And so immediately she says well I can't have any confidence in them anymore 
 if they'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them and realize they're one short
 But one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus
 And this was four hours later you know
 so {D you know i- 
 what do you do
 So she has switched to a different center now 
 and
