 Okay do you have young children
 *[[two utts]] well then you are familiar with it
 Okay 
 I have grandchildren 
 and I know well two of them have gone to preschool
 And I know what the experience my daughter has faced with that 
 Why don't you tell me what you have found
 Okay 
 so *[[need slash]] Okay 
 so it was in home child care 
 You took them to someone's home
 Well both times
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh
 I know that in raising my children I was fortunate 
 I didn't have to work 
 we didn't necessarily have a lot of things 
 and I know my daughter 
 because she has three 
 and to have three in day care you know even though one of them's in school full time one of them's you know in kindergarten *[[need a slash should be sd ]] That is a lot of money 
 *[[slash err should be sv]] I mean it's so expensive
 You have to really make a lot of money
 And I'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life
 bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas programs in the middle of the day or something
 You know and I know that one of the day cares and it's a well-known chain she was not at all happy with 
 there was too many children per person 
 They were just kind of left to play 
 there was no structure to 
 and the middle grandson went there as like a preschool thing
 She was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of learning and training and stuff 
 Not just there you know 
 so like I think he went well five mornings a week if I remember correctly
 you know and it was supposed to be a base 
 you know starting to learn the colors and learning to associate with children so that when he went to you know school and stuff 
 and she was most unhappy with it
 There was no structure 
 there was nothing to it 
 You know and she pulled him out of that one and put him in a another one that was excellent 
 it was like a little kindergarten
 And they had hot lunches 
 and they had classes that you know one class they'd do art 
 They even familiarized the children with computers
 it was really a very excellent one
 He's now five and a half 
 He's in kindergarten
 This was last year
 so you know it helped him and the first one he went to a church preschool that was very good
 The Methodist Church in Richardson
 The big one 
 and it was a excellent 
 they 
 very good
 does he
 Yeah 
 the church ones seem to be very well run
 really
 I just assumed that most churches going by you know experience there you know that they were good 
 I didn't know that you know 
 I'm not that familiar 
 I just know that you know First United Methodist of Richardson was just a great program
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's a pretty good size church too isn't it
 Uh-huh
 So Well are you enjoying staying home
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children And have enthusiasm
