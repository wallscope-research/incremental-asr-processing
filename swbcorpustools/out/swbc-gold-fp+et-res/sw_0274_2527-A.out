 Okay
 Well there are quite a few I guess state parks 
 and there's a couple of national parks I guess that you can camp at
 most of them have pretty good facilities 
 I don't know if the camping that I've done is really roughing it without a whole lot of stuff
 done a little bit of that mainly just like camping out at the state parks 
 I've been to a couple in Texas 
 and there's some real nice ones in Arkansas
 I think Arkansas has one of the best parks departments around
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 part of them are
 Yeah 
 they've got real nice lake system around their parks 
 One of them the gray I think that's one of the ones we've been to it's real nice there a bunch of lakes around it 
 there's a golf course and just a whole bunch of camping sites
 What about you

 we've talked about planning a trip up through 
 I have a sister-in-law that lives up through New Mexico and into Colorado and the Grand Canyon area 
 <> I don't know when I'm going to get a chance to do that 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 I'll bet 
 That one thing you said about the stars is really true 
 it's 
 when you're close to a big city like Dallas the lights kind of wash off the star 
 so it's nice to get away 
 It's just amazing how much you miss
 <> Uh-huh
 Well I guess we've talked as much as we need to on the subject
 Yeah 
 it was good talking to you Robert
