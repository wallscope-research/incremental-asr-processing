 No 
 I'm not that old either 
 I'm only twenty-nine
 So social changes aren't that much for me either
 Well yeah 
 that 
 I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be
 Uh-huh 
 relaxed and laid back and stuff 
 and 
 I think so
 I think so 
 and a lot 
 I think people are used to now saying what's on their minds more up front than they used to be
 Right
 Yeah 
 I think so 
 I think women have come out more too on like child abuse and the wife beatings 
 and like you said pro-choice and whatnot
 I think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something
 No 
 huh-uh
 Right
 Well I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom you know and all that stuff 
 and you know we didn't have to talk about 
 well basically her thing was just don't do it you know
 but I'm not naive to think that my children are not going to not do it
 It wasn't that long that I was that young
 And I've got a ten year old 
 and you know he thought he knows about condoms 
 and he knows about AIDS 
 and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I think that's stupidity on parents' part 
 I mean sex is rampant 
 and it always will be 
 and I think too noticing the kids that the fourth and fifth graders which is what my son is and stuff they're very open
 I mean the boys are very open because that's all I have is boys so that's all I'm around basically is boys 
 but they talk about things that my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know 
 and they sit down 
 and they look at you right in the face 
 and they expect a truthful answer
 You can't give them the you know Cabbage Patch answers and stuff 
 they 
 that just does not go
 And they can tell me basically some things that I don't know 
 But it's interesting listening to them 
 I think the social changes in them I think I see it more with that generation than I do with like our generation
 Yeah 
 I do too
 I know 
 well my son my fourth grader he is
