 Okay 
 Well I can go ahead and start and tell you mine 
 and 
 We're from San Antonio 
 and that's where I grew up
 So I was used to the heat out here right now
 it gets to about high seventies 
 and it gets very cold at night
 And Monterey it's right on the coast 
 And I don't know if your familiar with California coastline 
 *[[your> you're]] but we're about a two hour drive south of San Francisco
 And it's really nice 
 It's a big area for people to come from the different countries mostly like Japan Germany and England 
 And they usually go to Carmel and vacation on the beaches 
 so it's pretty nice year round 
 But always cool in the evenings And warm in the Summer 
 but it's stays pretty cold even during the Winter for as nice as it is
 And we usually get a fog right I guess about four o'clock 
 and it kind of rolls in over the coast 
 And then it usually breaks back off again the next morning 
 And if you go just a little bit ways in I'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards Salinas the weather completely changes 
 and it gets very hot and dry 
 and the fog never makes it that far
 But along here it's very different from the Texas type weather
 What's it like down there
 really 
 well at least you've got some 
 Uh-huh
 well that's good
 Uh-huh
 Have y'all been having any heat waves or like the ninety degree 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Women that's good For this time of year
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 So do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff this year
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I miss that 
 well that's real nice because I can remember two years ago that in about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just continued 
 At least y'all are getting some rain up in Dallas 
 I'm glad to hear that 
 Uh-huh
 Y'all weren't getting any of the strings of the tornadoes and stuff were you
 Uh-huh
 gosh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I really don't miss all the heat there
 I'm getting acclimated to have the cool evenings 
 so we get a bit of a relief
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Is that what Dallas is 
 okay 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come 
 it's a complete mess everything floods all the under passes
 I didn't realize that Dallas had that same problem
 Uh-huh 
 Well we could use some rain up here 
 We're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought up here 
 and they had a pretty good early Spring 
 and we got quite a bit of rain 
 but it wasn't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years
 so they're still talking water rationing this Summer 
 so it would seem strange because in San Antonio 
 we had lived out west of San Antonio in Castroville
 And the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing 
 and I thought gee I'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the California Pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers 
 and there's no problem with water 
 And then I came here and found out they were in the you know four year draught 
 So I said well this is pretty much like Texas 
 And it pretty much is in the middle of Summer 
 They have rolling hills around here 
 but they turn to golden dead grass for the majority of the Summer just because there is no water to keep them green
 But it's a really nice area 
 it's just such a change from Texas because I had grown up with the heat
 and used to essentially 
 like you said you have the cold Winter 
 and then you have the hot Summer Spring 
 And to come here it's kind of the temperate weather all year round 
 It's kind of like Spring I guess year round 
 and then in the Winter 
 and then it seems sort of like a San Antonio early Winter or Fall year-round 
 So it seems like we only have two Springs or two seasons 
 and that would be Spring and Fall
 We never really get any of the other ones
 But it's a really nice change of pace
 Yeah 
 To the heat 
 I really don't miss the heat
 we do a lot of you know 
 when you do a lot of outside like running and stuff it's just so much easier up here 
 and you don't have to worry about the high humidity
 Does Dallas get high humidity 
 Or is it pretty dry
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It seems like San Antonio is increasing in humidity over the years 
 because I had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years
 and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid And here well it's right by the ocean 
 but it's not the same as Corpus 
 Corpus you get that humid salty feeling in the air
 But here well the water is extremely cold up here 
 you can lay on the beach all you want 
 but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit And a thick wet suit at that because it's just extremely cold 
 and I 
 for some reason because of the cold ocean water the air is always cool 
 It's never humid or sticky or salty feeling 
 so I really like that about this area 
 And we just hadn't expected it 
 we were used to what gulf coast weather was like when we came here to Pacific coast weather 
 It's just completely different 
 and it's much nicer
 Uh-huh 
 It does 
 and the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region 
 But you 
 but we like it 
 so it's a nice change 
 So we'll be here a couple of years 
 and we thought well we'll take advantage of it and see what all the Pacific coast is like
 So it's been good
 I imagine 
 Virginia I imagine gets real humid doesn't it
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Not like Texas where everything comes to a stand still
 Uh-huh 
 I'll have to try that out because I had heard that North Carolina was sort of like that
 And I've just never really been in that region of the country 
 and I guess I'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like 
 Because a lot of people that are from that North Carolina region really like it 
 And they get the snow 
 but they said it doesn't really get messy 
 and it doesn't really hang around that long
 So the people I know that are from there they always miss it 
 and they want to go back 
 Nothing seems quite as good 
 But anyway Well 
 gee-whiz 
 gosh 
 Well I hope it moves up this way 
 but I'm sure it won't 
 Yeah 
 Because we could sure use it 
 Well you think that takes care of the time and 
 Okay 
 Well I sure appreciate hearing how things are going in Texas and 
 Yeah 
 Good luck to you
 Okay 
 We'll see you
 Bye
