 Well I guess it depends on what age 
 I am in the thirty something 
 so I know 
 I mean I lived through it 
 are you old enough to know about the war
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Well yeah 
 you are old enough
 But it was on the fringe
 It ended when I was in college when I turned nineteen in nineteen seventy 
 I cannot even remember at this point 
 when I turned nineteen it was the year that the draft was still going on 
 If I had been a male or in Israel I would have been number two
 Yeah 
 So I learned a lesson in gender 
 in terms of the war I do not know 
 actually I do not really know that much about it 
 I just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media you know 
 I guess I think it was not that great that we were in there in terms of for how long it lasted
 You know
 What do you think
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 The devastation 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 And in full faction 
 yeah
 Yeah
 it just kind of dragged on 
 I do not know how you were historically 
 But I was a little bit older before I realized just how long it had been going on since L B J and 
 I mean I pa- 
 Yeah
 It really well 
 yeah 
 in fact because in terms of when your 
 there is at least ten years between us 
 so in terms of when you were in school I am sure that it was you know the majority of your high school and junior high years
 one of the things I did not like was I can't even say it the weaponry systems that they used
 it just did not seem that I do not know technically we knew what we were doing either
 And then you heard about the things like agent orange et cetera 
 and you would think you know just how could the government or the Pentagon or whomever is in charge there been so careless
 
 Conscious 
 yeah
 Nutrisweet
 yeah 
 and all these other things 
 That is true 
 monetarily too I just do not think we have done enough for the Vietnamese people as a whole in South Vietnam in general in helping them restore themselves
 You know and I don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there 
 Yeah 
 I mean I do not think they do 
 But I just think it is kind of a shame that you still hear things about the children that are orphans there 
 and 
 so on a whole I do not know war is not good 
 And that one I probably 
 my main opinion would be we should not have done it
 Well that is what I know about the Vietnam War 
 Unless you 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Vietnam
 Jeez 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 And that 
 Uh-huh
 In terms of the personal 
 Yeah 
 The bitterness is more on a personal level than on a 
 Uh-huh
 The money is 
 after 
 yeah
 I mean I think it started actually like like in the late fifties I mean like in fifty-eight fifty-nine
 So it really 
 I mean because I know in nineteen sixty-three I mean I was nine years old when Kennedy was shot
 So I mean I remember right around then that's when I first started hearing about Vietnam 
 But then as I got older and studied in school I realized it was even going on before that
 You know and you think to yourself my goodness Eisenhower 
 That sounds ancient 
 yeah 
 And I know you know a lot of the Vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties guys that I know that they are just kind of bitter you know 
 they you know 
 I hate to quo- that movie BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY 
 but it is that kind of idea
 You know they just do not feel that socially they were given 
 like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome
 Yeah 
 They were not given the 
 Yeah 
 So well I won't keep you any more
 That is probably about as much as we both know 
 But thanks for talking to me
 yes 
 is that where you are at
 I know where that is 
 That is beautiful where you are at
 D C 
 yeah 
 Are you a native of there
 Yeah 
 Dallas it is ninety-two degrees here today 
 but at least the humidity is below forty percent which makes it kind of like Phoenix
 Really
 Well you 
 Yeah 
 well you are not missing too much then 
 Really 
 Well take it easy
 Okay 
 Bye-bye
