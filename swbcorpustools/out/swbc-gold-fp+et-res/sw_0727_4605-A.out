 Okay 
 Do you work with a company that gives drug testing 
 they do
 Uh-huh 
 What 
 did they do that before you went in or what
 they will huh
 Oh 
 Okay 
 Well I've 
 I worked 
 I don't work right now because my company I worked for P I E went bankrupt
 but they was getting a program set up that for all new hires they was going drug give them drug tests 
 But they didn't hire very many new hires because all the people that usually work there you know just stayed there because they had been there for a long long time
 But actually I think they should do it
 You know I don't think anybody needs anybody to be working for them that's on drugs of any kind you know
 But I don't know whether I believe that they should just randomly do it 
 I think they should kind of warn them like you know well we're going to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired you know that this is what is going to happen 
 And then if you don't like it why then you know you'll have to go look for a job someplace else
 Well I suppose you are right there too you know
 personally I 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I suppose they fire you and everything right then huh 
 Or what do they do with you guys if that you guys get 
 I see
 Yeah 
 well I don't either 
 I wouldn't even think about it 
 I think anybody that does them are dumb you know 
 Yeah 
 really 
 You're so stupid God 
 and you just watch it on T V and see how it just burns your brain completely up you know 
 You don't 
 Yeah 
 really dumb huh
 But Let's see what else was I going to say here
 Yeah 
 I think so 
 I think they all should test really you know 
 it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore that I don't know what's wrong with the people 
 but I think that the government should do something about stopping it completely 
 About it coming into our country 
 You know they just slap somebody's little hand 
 and you know well don't do that again 
 and then you know they'll get out 
 and they're right back at it again
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 But other than that why I don't know 
 Like I say maybe one of these days I'll get a job because I am looking still for a part-time job you know since my company went bankrupt 
 and I'll see what they do you know 
 But like I say I wouldn't care because I don't even smoke 
 so they can test me all I want 
 I wonder if you take medicine if that would effect it
 Yeah 
 see now that would be really unfair then huh
 You know
 Yeah 
 Find out you know if you have been taking some kind of medication and you know if that would effect it and everything
 But well I guess that's about all we can talk about 
 I think our five minutes is about up anyhow
 Okay Lewis 
 and maybe I'll talk to you again
 Alrighty
 Bye-bye 
 Bye
