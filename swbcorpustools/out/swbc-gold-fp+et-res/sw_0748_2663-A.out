 I just pressed my 
 I got one that's interesting not too controversial 
 I 
 you know not 
 doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican 
 I do get somewhat of a kick out of 
 because Schwartzkopf or the other generals who I admire how everyone wants to make get them in politics 
 I think that's kind of an interesting recent thing that I could think of recently that 
 I was wondering what you thought about that getting a general into politics
 Right 
 Well I've been thinking about it 
 and I kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero 
 those 
 we're looking for a hero 
 Well TIME magazine was saying that in essence the general's staff was comparing to corporate presidents 
 and they said in general generals are more familiar with training that they believe in training more
 They are much more educated than the average corporate president 
 and so they really were very positive on a general's staff person having a very much better education than the average corporate president 
 So I thought well maybe
 Well that too 
 that too 
 And you know they talk about the Army 
 and because of the war 
 and why did we win and all that 
 and they talked about how the training was so important 
 And that's so important in industry 
 so you know they're liable to be right That generals in the service 
 and Schwartzkopf you know might make a good politician whether it be Governor or whatever you know
 Yeah 
 it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs you know
 everyone has a boss of course
 Yeah
 No 
 that's true 
 that's true
 you pick one
 I just thought of that one when they brought up about politics 
 That was pretty easy
 you don't have to pick Democratic or Republican 
 you can pick anything you want 
 go ahead
 Well I have an easy answer for that I wish they would do it is that limit it you know to eight or ten years max
 You know whether that's two five year terms or whatever
 you know you're not
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I don't know 
 I do like the limitation of the President 
 and I think there is a needed change 
 I think the same thing should happen for Congress 
 I'd lik- you know 
 that would be my answer of an easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years 
 My God it's ridiculous you know
 We had 
 I think I had one of the subject about voting and voting apathy or something like that 
 and I think that the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time 
 I can't believe that a country our big votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning til seven o'clock at night you know
 Of course they have absentee which is getting to be a lot easier
 and I vote as often on absentee as I can because it's so easy now 
 But I think gee whiz you could make it a couple days 
 It's just if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them a couple of days
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Are you in Dallas
 Boy I live in Arlington 
 I am so happy not to be part of Dallas when I see those folks there
 I mean I don't know if you like the mayor/
 but I think your mayor 
 the city council 
 the 
 what is the woman's name whose not the mayor but the 
 *[[typo should be who's]] Yeah 
 the city manager 
 All of them need to be thrown out 
 I mean they're just awful just awful
 Uh-huh 
 I know
 It's so awful that politicians always spent consulting money That we put them in office and then they go out and spend a couple hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy consultants 
 and then they don't even do that recommendation you know
 I mean it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in
 Well you're right there
 You're right there 
 people are 
 politics 
 the voting is still not as much as you think in all kinds of issues really
 Yeah 
 it is 
 hopefully people will get more involved
 yeah 
 but those are the ones that are complaining I think a lot 
 I see it here at T I 
 The guys that don't take any interest in and constantly on the negative of everything
 And Is that right 
 Right 
 you're right 
 you're right 
 <> I think they could do more about voting
 What are the issues 
 I'm a Democrat 
 I want to just say that I'm so sad that there isn't a strong Democrat 
 I don't even know 
 I could go out and debate George Bush better than I see any Democrat doing it
 You know I mean at least I'd like to see compe- 
 because I like competition you know
 I think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead 
 I'm so disgusted with the Democratic party 
 I can not believe it you know
 *[[typo cannot]] Yeah
 Yeah 
 but I still think in the last ten years 
 you know of course that's not a recent event 
 that's only my opinion 
 I guess I really shouldn't talk about that 
 But I don't know whether they're recent events 
 I guess on this speech thing they want us to use a variety of words
 How many times have you called by the way
 really I 
 Yeah 
 I've already got twelve cards 
 You get any cards in the mail
 I don't know 
 I'm amazed by 
 of course we're not talking about politics 
 but I am amazed by 
 people say they got thirty 
 Well I wonder why you need thirty renditions of the persons voice 
 but I'm not in voice synthesis
 But I'd sure like to see a summary of it 
 We'll get to politics I'm sorry 
 Yeah 
 right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 bye-bye
