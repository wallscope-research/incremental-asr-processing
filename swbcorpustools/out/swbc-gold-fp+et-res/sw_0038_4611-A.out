 Hi 
 I should say something
 That I'm the least informed 
 this is totally accidental that I have to talk about this topic 
 But I'm the least informed person in the whole United States
 This has not been determined yet 
 but I've never read a newspaper in my entire life 
 and I never watch T V news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off 
 But 
 Well no 
 I've explored that with lots of people 
 they've tried to lock me up and things like that 
 But I'm basically not interested 
 and I also find everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and off the 
 what am I trying to say 
 I do learn about things Largely from friends 
 and I occasionally will read something like the NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS 
 You know someone will write a book about something 
 and then I'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier
 But it 
 and somehow 
 and anything I participated in or know about when I read about it in the paper is always covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that I don't have much confidence in it 
 But I mean I don't think it's just that I'm lazy 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 Doesn't want 
 Let me ask by the way just for the record 
 I totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them 
 So I mean I'm not being elitist in that sense I hope 
 Yeah 
 What 
 Yeah 
 By the way when you say most people think it is 
 I think it's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine think it is percent 
 you don't 
 Right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I did on the Supreme Court hearings for the whole business of 
 see I actually have a 
 Yeah 
 the Thomas and Anita Hill business
 I mean that's the closest thing 
 I deeply cared about that
 and I sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine 
 and when I arrived at her house she was engrossed in that 
 We ended up watching it for a couple of hours Zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and watching it some more 
 And I thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on 
 But even then I didn't end up doing it on my own 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 right 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Do you ever read
