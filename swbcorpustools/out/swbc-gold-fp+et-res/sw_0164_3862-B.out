 Hello
 Hi 
 my name is Pat Johnson 
 and I live in Texas too
 No
 No 
 I live in Dallas 
 I work for the Dallas school system
 We might as well
 I understand we are doing care of the elderly right
 And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I would find it very difficult to place my father or my step-mother in a place like that Particularly since I know how they feel about it
 Yes
 Yes
 I do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for you know if you are faced with placing someone In a place like that you know aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that is offered and such 
 but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference 
 And I have a a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and has no family who you know could care for her 
 And I know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about her situation
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 I think it would matter too kinds of disabilities that the nursing home accepts Because there are some who poor things you know don't have any real grasp on reality any longer
 And they may be ambulatory 
 but they tend to behave like small children 
 and that would be very difficult I think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to to have to deal with on a daily basis
 
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh

 Yes 
 Alzheimer
