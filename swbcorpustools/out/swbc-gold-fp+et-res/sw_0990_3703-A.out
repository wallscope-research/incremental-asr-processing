 Okay
 we have small children two and four
 and so our dining is very limited 
 we're past that now 
 We're a little sick of that 
 No 
 we're more 
 like you know like Wyatt's Cafeteria
 Yeah 
 that way 
 And the kids just love everything that's there 
 so we're pretty fortunate 
 Kind of buffet style 
 so you can go in and go out 
 and the food's already served 
 and you don't have to wait 
 and it's already in front of them when you sit down 
 and things like Souper Salads you know 
 again it's buffet 
 and it's already prepared 
 and any eating area that you just don't have to wait an extreme amount of time
 We 
 No 
 We tried a Bennigan's one time 
 and it was terrible 
 Course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyway 
 we waited almost forty-five minutes before everything was brought out 
 and we were ready to go home
 Yeah
 No 
 We fought with them for forty-five minutes
 So we rarely go eat in those kind of eating situations any more 
 But we do love to eat out 
 and we do it as often as we can 
 and times that we do have baby-sitters we try and catch some things that we normally wouldn't do you know
 let me see for New Year's we went to eat at Uncle Julio's
 It's on Walnut and Greenville
 It's called Uncle Julio's
 basically Mexican food
 And it's supposed to be very similar to 
 what is that restaurant off of Central 
 it's a Mexican restaurant off of Central 
 No 
 but I've heard about it
 Really
 Really 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 We like seafood also 
 and 
 Vincent's 
 No 
 we haven't
 Really
 Really
 No
 Uh-huh
 okay 
 I've seen it
 Yeah
 Yeah
 We've been to Chefalia's 
 It's basically the same thing seafood Cajun style
 That's in Addison off of Belt Line
 Midway 
 Like or or it's right at Midway 
 And excellent food
 So 
 what is that
 really
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Really 
 And where is that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 well my birthday's coming up 
 so 
 I need an excuse 
 Uh-huh
