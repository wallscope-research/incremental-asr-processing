 I'm ready 
 Okay 
 well I don't have an elderly person that I could send to a nursing home or anything 
 both of my parents are dead 
 but I did have a friend that was in a convalescent home like a nursing home 
 and I went there very often to visit her and made me feel really sad 
 If I did have a mother living I don't think I could do that
 I think they would be better off being at home with their family you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I can believe that 
 Yes 
 because most elderly people can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that 
 In a situation like that maybe it would be better
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 see now that's really a sad situation
 Yeah 
 really you know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 right 
 right
 Yeah 
 in a case like that you know you more or less think it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 but the cost of these nursing homes are so You know 
 a lot of people can't afford that
 You know so you really have no choice that way you know if you're not rich you know 
 I know this lady you know that was a friend of mine 
 now her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there you know 
 and it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 then bring her back home at night
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 you know just come home for dinner 
 and then usually they want to go to bed fairly early anyhow
 You know so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that 
 but 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 if they don't know anybody and they don't know what's going on around them and everything like that well I can see maybe a nursing home would be better you know
 But if they have their wits about them and everything why it's kind of hard 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Well my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that 
 and luckily I mean she lived by herself 
 and then you know one day she had a heart attack 
 and she was gone 
 so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that 
 but there's so many of us kids there was like seven of us that we wouldn't have probably allowed that to happen anyhow
 You know she could have taken turns living with each one of us you know for a period of time because we all don't live in the same city anyhow nor the same state 
 so 
 I have a couple more that live out here in California 
 but then I have a broth-
