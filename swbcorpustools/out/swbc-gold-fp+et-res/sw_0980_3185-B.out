 Basically about the same as what you've probably had
 Uh-huh
 you like the rain do you
 Uh-huh
 are you 
 I don't care for that as much
 No
 I'm a summer person
 I like the heat
 Yeah 
 and I'm from Utah 
 so I like the four seasons
 I just don't like the cold
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 the other thing is I don't like the rain either
 Well we have several children that are in sports 
 and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on on and on
 I like it better I think
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 The thing about when it gets hot here is I don't like the humidity 
 that part I don't care about
 really
 is that right
 Well another reason 
 well I guess I can't say that I don't like the rain completely 
 We have a little garden that we have 
 it really helps our garden 
 and you know I don't know if that's because plants are just that way 
 and they like rain 
 or it seems they thrive when it rains 
 they just really 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well 
 Well I like seventies okay
 I don't like nineties
 You can give me seventies
 and you can give me eighties
 and I'm okay 
 But when it gets too hot then I don't like that
 I stay in the house because It's just too hot
 Yeah 
 yeah
 That's okay 
 I've thought about that too 
 and when we take our vacations we do take them in August sometimes so that we can be away from here 
 It just really gets way 
 when it gets way too hot 
 and we've been here for several years 
 and we've been here years when it's been hundreds 
 and 
 Years 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 he always did such a good job I thought
 A good weather man
 Yeah 
 Anyway I guess it's 
 That's okay 
 they say when you're done you're done 
 so Yeah
 you don't have to wait for them to cut off your time 
 You just say Have a good day or whatever
 You too
 You too
