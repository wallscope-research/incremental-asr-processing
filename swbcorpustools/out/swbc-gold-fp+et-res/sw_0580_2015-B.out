 Yes 
 yes 
 is that one that you're talking about 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's true 
 or the ones that are generated by a computer 
 It's just a computer voice that comes on the line 
 Those are the ones that I really really hate too
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 sometimes I get them on my answering machine at home 
 and I hate that when I've got a whole bunch of messages 
 and I go through them 
 and most of them aren't from anybody at all
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yes 
 see I have an unlisted telephone number 
 but I still get all of those calls 
 and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I don't even understand 
 So yeah 
 I do 
 I really feel that's an invasion of my privacy 
 I agree with you on that particular subject there 
 Let me see
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 Living in an apartment complex though you know you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations 
 but they still come up to the front door and you know walk around 
 So usually what I do is I'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey there's people coming around you know 
 and they're trying to sell something 
 or they're from a religious organization 
 and I really hate that 
 I really really do 
 I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago 
 and gosh it was about nine o'clock at night too 
 It wasn't even what I would consider you know family hours 
 time to you know start going to bed 
 and it was somebody from oh what was it the Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints 
 and I've read a lot about that particular sect 
 and I don't particularly care for it 
 so I especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 no 
 I agree with you there 
 If they want to choose that particular religion that's fine with me too you know as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in 
 and I don't like the way that they do it either 
 and it's their mission that they do it 
 They go door to door 
 and they go out into the public 
 and they actually have the teenagers serving two years you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work 
 and I don't know 
 I just don't particularly care for that at all 
 And that's one thing that I feel really strongly about though is you know people coming up to my door and especially religious organizations and wanting you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion 
 because I have my own
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's true 
 yeah 
 No 
 I didn't go that far 
 but yeah 
 I probably could do the same thing you know 
 I don't have a storm door 
 but I'm sure I could rig up something 
 But you know I don't think that that would stop people 
 it's like they see that word 
 and it says go instead of stop 
 goodness
 gosh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 that's true 
 that's true 
 Well what else
 I know 
 but I remember you talked about something 
 you started off and said 
 well let me think 
 you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door 
 You said something else 
 I can't remember what it was 
 and I thought yeah 
 that kind of touched a nerve right there 
 but we got to talking about the people coming to you at the front door
 goodness 
 okay 
 is our five minutes up
 Pretty close
 Well it was nice talking to you too Jim
 Okay 
 thanks 
 bye
