 Would you then go hiking 
 I mean would the camping be part of a long hike
 
 Were you up in Wisconsin 
 or would you go into Can- 
 where would you camp 
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 That's beautiful 
 Right 
 yeah 
 Well most of my camping 
 I haven't done much since I was a kid
 but we'd basically take the tent up in the Sierras and usually just camp near some stream or some lake
 And just 
 it wasn't even a full tent 
 It would be more a tarp strung up between trees 
 and my dad would take four kids My brother and myself and two cousins
 and we just thought it was absolute heaven
 there was certainly nothing like a bathroom a shower or anything near by 
 It was dig your own hole 
 and and I'm not sure I'd do that anymore 
 but it 
 actually some friends of mine and I are planning to camp this summer for four days 
 Also going fishing 
 and I have a idea it's going to be a lot more equipment and a lot more stuff than before 
 Yeah 
 But 
 Yeah
 my 
 Uh-huh
