 Okay 
 now the term personal computer 
 I don't happen to have one at home 
 but I do have a personal computer on my desk here
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to shall we say bypass the formal procurement process 
 And it works just fine 
 It says it's a monochrome monitor Panasonic printer no big deal 
 it does the things I need for it to do
 No 
 it's not even that
 I think that's about where it is
 yeah 
 I do that 
 I do some Lotus on it do some Samna some P F M nothing extremely complex
 Uh-huh
 Yep
 yeah 
 I bet that's a pretty nice setup
 Yep
 Wow
 Yep
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Right
 Well I seem to always be in the next to the last generation of word processing software 
 When everyone was in Samna I was still in P F M 
 and now that I finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect 
 So I can never quite stay current with that
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 
 I can believe that
 No 
 not really 
 I'm not that up be on that sort of thing
 okay
 okay 
 Okay 
 well it sounds like you're pretty much into computers
 I can believe that 
 Well it's been interesting
 Yeah 
 of course needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing
 I wo- 
 is that the newest thing now the four eighty-six
 that must be a fairly recent release
 Okay 
 okay 
 Because I had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes 
 but I didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Sure
 Yeah
 I did too 
 and you have a good day
 Bye-bye
