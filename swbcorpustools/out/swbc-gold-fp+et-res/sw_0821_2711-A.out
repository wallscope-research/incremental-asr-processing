 So the topic is vacations
 I think so 
 I enjoy them
 the last was back down to Lubbock to visit parents 
 It was 
 The last one was back down to Lubbock Texas to visit family
 But that's not the tradition for us
 we enjoyed Yellow Stone real well last year
 Yeah
 Rocky Mountain National Park
 it's just like any of the other national parks 
 It 
 you know there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching 
 and 
 it's 
 Yeah 
 we usually try and drive up there once every year or two
 Sure
 To the top the of the peak 
 sure
 it's not bad at all 
 it's a beautiful drive
 Now I admit up there the altitude is kind of <> interesting
 You know you get a little lightheaded and giddy 
 but it's fun You know take along a picnic lunch 
 and 
 we love it
 no 
 they're only I mean to the west of us Here in the Springs 
 you know it's right there at the very foot of the Rockies 
 You know and once a week we drive up into the mountains you know usually once a week once every other week
 Yeah 
 well I enjoy hills in Texas too 
 I've been in Sherman
 No 
 I haven't 
 you
 once to Mexico City 
 but just a little day thing on business
 that's nice
 Did you enjoy it
 Did you enjoy it
 Uh-huh
 got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture 
 and 
 Oh 
 Huh
 So the place that we've gone on vacation that I think I enjoyed the most was Seattle
 Well we 
 was two years ago we went during the drought
 I'm sorry three years ago 
 It had been dry for a whole week
 It didn't rain for a whole week
 Yeah 
 somehow we picked the right time and walked down on the wharf 
 and I think we ate seafood every meal for well not quite every meal but most meals for a week
 it was wonderful 
 the Pacific Science Museum the little girl really enjoyed 
 It's <> very interesting
 Yeah
 Yes 
 it was super 
 and went to the Seattle Aquarium
 And it's right there on the ocean and <> down there on the wharf by the piers and all 
 and you walk down in a dome a glass dome
 and the bay is circulating over your head 
 and you can watch the fish swim by and sharks 
 and it's 
 Yeah 
 and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises and it's amazing
 absolutely
 Without a doubt 
 Seattle is beautiful 
 and the mountains to the east of Seattle are just incredible
 I rode a ferry for the first time in my life
 You know up there <> you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry Instead of by bridge 
 And you drive your car on 
 You park your car 
 you set your brake 
 You walk upstairs 
 and you have a beer or coffee or whatever depending on the time of day
 It's amazing
 Yes
 Yes
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 And there are people literally that everyday take the ferry you know and drive on to it 
 yeah 
 live on an island off shore from Seattle
 And you 
 everyday they drive on the ferry 
 They go upstairs and have their morning coffee
 Take for the twenty to hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and you know depending on where it is
 Well you know in some areas you know depends on how far they are commuting
 it's strict 
 I'm a West Texan
 Out there in the land of no water And to think that people live on the water daily is kind of odd to me 
 You know it's a different life style than we are used to
 Galveston
 Yes 
 I liked Galveston real well 
 <> there's 
 one of the areas down there close to Galveston is 
 I forget the name of the island
 but it's a bird sanctuary with all kinds of wild birds Whooping and sand hill cranes and ducks and pelicans 
 and it's very pretty 
 I like the Rio Grande Valley Real well 
 Of course you haven't lived until you have been to San Antone to the Alamo
 Yeah 
 the river walk 
 it's 
 And you need to go in the Spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there 
 it's just simply beautiful
 And of course always when I lived in West Texas had to annually go down to San Antone just 
 Yeah 
 and go to Lone Star 
 and you know make my annual pilgrimage to the Lone Star Brewery 
 and *[[should be slash unit]] El Paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way 
 *[[should be slash unit]] You know go across the border and all 
 the Davis Mountains are interesting out there in West Texas
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter because <> there's a beauty to the desert that it can best be appreciated when you are not burning up
 You know whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at It's most enjoyable you know to get warm
 That's nice 
 down there in the lower Rio Grande Valley closer to where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf that's interesting 
 I love the Texas Hill Country
 And Austin is neat for an occasional visit
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it's a fun few days 
 U T is real pretty
 there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area Marble Falls and all 
 That's real pretty 
 I would say definitely go see that part 
 and I'd say go to Midland once just for the heck of it
 I don't know why exactly
 But you know find out when they are holding <> the petroleum fair
