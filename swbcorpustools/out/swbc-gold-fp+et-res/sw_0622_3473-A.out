 Okay 
 go ahead
 Yeah
 Don't do it 
 Well I tell you I firmly believe in exercising 
 I think it's a 
 I do it every day on a regular basis 
 I 
 Well I just got back from biking twelve and a half miles 
 but this time of year you can't get much biking in 
 but every morning I use this President's council of physical fitness 
 and it's worth doing 
 and you can do it anywhere 
 I travel quite a bit in my business 
 and you can do it you know wherever you're at 
 and if you do it 
 I do it every morning usually after breakfast before I take a shower and get you know dressed you know to go to work 
 And now what I do 
 I mean I've done this for you know like fifteen years 
 so you don't start at this kind of regiment you know
 I 
 so what I'm telling you isn't something you go out and do 
 and you'll hurt yourself 
 every 
 it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because I do it all the time 
 but I do twenty-five where you have your arms above your head and your body twisters touch you know left and right toe 
 and I do ten right and left trunk twisters
 And I do about sixty bicycle leg thrust type things
 And I do twenty leg lifters on each side You know when you're laying on the floor
 And then I do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups 
 and then I do about 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 And then thirty 
 now if you did football like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you 
 you know prone type things where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing 
 and that takes maybe about thirteen minutes in the morning
 Well 
 Years ago I used to referee football
 and to stay in condition I did that just as a normal basis 
 and I tell you just by doing it 
 well example this summer I was about fifteen pounds heavier than I wanted to be 
 so I increased 
 I do three hundred sit ups a day now but not in the morning 
 I do a hundred then 
 and then I do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before I go to bed
 I lost fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles
 and you know you can eat anything you want drink anything you want 
 but you don't you know 
 within reason you know you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being
 and I just you know 
 you're ready to go at a 
 I think it's really important
 Good
 Well that's why Chuck I think if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like 
 well I like biking 
 and during the summer I'll do you know at least seventy-five miles a week and when I really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty 
 but you can't you know 
 there's excuses weather
 or you don't have time or something like that 
 But if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth you're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour And you get up a half hour earlier 
 and once you start getting into that you just feel good
 and you look a whole lot better
 Unfortunately not 
 and there's no way I can get her to
 like it's something you either just really want to do it 
 or you can't talk anyone into it 
 If you don't like to exercise you know it isn't going to happen
 I sure wish she would 
 She's you know unfortunately overweight 
 but she's a wonderful woman 
 and you know no sense getting in arguments with anybody about it
 Well 
 No problem at all
 And if you get one of these mats You know go to a store they normally have these exercise things these A B Cs of physical fitness on them 
 One of my kids got me one of those for Christmas one year 
 and 
 it's just an exercise mat that rolls up 
 so you can put it up you know just in the corner
 Well yeah 
 you can do that 
 but it doesn't 
 Yeah 
 it's a foam thing 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 and it's just about six feet long rolls up
 and I don't take it on trips with me 
 you could 
 but I don't mind you know 
 if I do like sit ups I'll throw a towel down or something You know 
 so you don't have the abrasive
