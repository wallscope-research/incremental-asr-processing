 I don't know 
 I'm not a real great football follower 
 I guess there are two basic teams that I seem to follow every year 
 One is the Dallas Cowboys 
 and the other is the Oklahoma Sooners
 being a native Okie I like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing 
 No
 No 
 it's funny 
 I got out and got my bachelor's degree in seventy-three and never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since
 But I always enjoyed watching them 
 I just 
 growing up in Oklahoma there it was always the home team kind of like Dallas is around here
 And there's always been an interest there
 Yeah
 I guess you keep those things you grew up with 
 I worked in Missouri for a while 
 and I was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on T V when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals 
 and I was rooting for the Cowboys
 But they were kind of closer to home when I struck up with them 
 I really don't know what's going to take place with the Cowboys this year 
 Everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction they're going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year 
 In a way that happened this past season 
 and I think that's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's a chance that maybe these guys are right maybe they will come through and do something this year 
 I look for it to be a pretty good year
 They did 
 they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't familiar with 
 Some of them turned out to be pretty good players 
 some of them didn't 
 and you know maybe the stuff that Jerry Jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off 
 At least we hope it will
 Yeah 
 but they have always been a really strong team
 Once the pressure gets turned on they seem to loose it
 See that's the typical trait of the Dallas Cowboys And the Oklahoma Sooners 
 It's funny over the years
 It's been a rough road to hoe ever since he left 
 I don't know why it's so hard to find a good quarterback these days
 Well yeah
 You know he was one of the few who come through in history that can really perform 
 we hope 
 every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through 
 In a way Aikman has done some of that 
 But the guy winds up getting hurt every other game
 Yeah 
 they did 
 They put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside 
 it's funny watching them play 
 he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks 
 when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best
 And I haven't quite figured that out 
 if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing They say hey we got to do something now And then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes
 So I don't know 
 I'm looking for a good year 
 I guess we're always looking for a good year
 no 
 I don't think the Cowboys have got a chance 
 I think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year 
 and they'll get close to it 
 They'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end
 that's a good question 
 I'm figuring either the Eagles or possibly San Francisco 
 I'm not real sure
 They did 
 So I don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team sometimes it brings in new motivation 
 and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come
 Well that's true
 They are tough 
 and they're big 
 they're mean 
 and they are going to come right through you if you don't do something
 yeah 
 yeah
 No 
 no
 And it's funny 
 you know You like to pull for the underdog 
 and for a long time I was pulling for Denver
 Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes because of some of the stupid stuff he does 
 but he's a good quarterback 
 He's got a good arm 
 sometimes it's too good because he throws too hard
 I mean L A 
 sorry
 yeah
 Has it been snowing up there
 Wow
 Well that will make the skiers happy
 you bet 
 yeah 
 up around the Keystone and Copper Mountain those guys will love that 
 Well good to talk to you
 You guys have a good time keep those printers coming
 All right 
 bye
