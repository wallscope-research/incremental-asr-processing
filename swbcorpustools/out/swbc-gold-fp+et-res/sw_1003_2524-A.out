 Okay
 Uh-huh
 I like to do like physical things like sports
 I really enjoy softball 
 and my favorite is volleyball
 but I'm at school 
 I'm in you know 
 I live up at the college So sometimes it's hard for me to do that 
 so I just like sometimes 
 I like just to get away 
 I go to my room and I like walk in turn the radio on or you know just kind of like veg out or something

 I like to do that stuff but like when I'm at school I don't have time to do it or even time to learn how to do it
 Yeah

 Like I come from a family of twelve children
 and when I'm up here I really miss my younger brothers and sisters 
 so you know that's a change because there's nine of them that are younger than me
 like when I know my mom and dad aren't home I'll call home just to talk to my little brothers and sisters
