ing seems to be a topic that's going to probably take about a generation to catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two 
 And we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up 
 it does seem to be a lot of habits to break 
 I wasn't raised as a kid on it 
 but my kids are 
 and so they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do 
 and we were doing all right there until the price dropped out 
 and they weren't worth anything anymore
 And we 
 it took us almost a year to get a garbage sack full 
 We just don't drink that many 
 So as far as at home use we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of Doctor Pepper or something 
 and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in 
 at the time it was still about forty or fifty cents a pound 
 and we came out with about a dollar 
 it just really wasn't worth it
 Yeah
 So they realized you know 
 well of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old 
 that was a big deal 
 but we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it 
 and then T I started keeping up with cans there 
 so occasionally I'll bring whatever I've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there 
 Least it gets back into the system 
 but as far as a habit at the house I haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up 
 Have you all got the individual containers yet
 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 it seemed like 
 if I recall it's been a long time 
 They're way behind schedule on that particular part of it 
 They were fine on the big green containers 
 but seems like they said they were just going to have a bin 
 and all different types would go in there 
 and then that they would sort it as needed 
 it seemed that there was 
 at the time anyway the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting 
 But when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses 
 the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor 
 so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than having a household try it 
 But I don't know 
 that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Right
 That's true
 Right
 Yeah
 They don't do that 
 We live next to a set of railroad tracks 
 and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to you know break them 
 but they weren't that successful 
 so there were a lot of bottles to be returned 
 and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day 
 and 
 Yeah 
 just a little bit of begging will 
 Right 
 Well I wonder
 Yeah
 Right 
 yeah 
 Where do you take your cans
