 All right 
 I guess we're in the process of a home repair right at this point 
 because we're painting the outside of our house 
 I don't know 
 I guess you would consider that a home repair
 Certainly 
 and interesting enough this time we're changing the color which makes it an addition 
 What is your most recent 
 You did that recently too uh
 Does it make a big difference
 Huh-uh 
 That's neat isn't it
 I was really really tired of the color 
 it's helping 
 We're not quite through 
 but it really is looking good 
 we went through a process of home repairs on a rental house we had 
 probably the most extensive and the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do 
 we didn't have very much money 
 and so we had to do it ourselves in kind of a slow process 
 but we learned how to retile bathtubs and just all kinds of things that are unusual
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 It's nice to not have a drip through from the roof isn't it 
 That's awful 
 Howard and I were talking about home repair the other night in connection with scouting 
 We've got a scout coming up 
 and I think it's neat for young people to learn how to take care of a household you know like fixing dripping faucets and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that
 Huh-uh
 How does the paneling 
 it looks lots better than 
 do you like it better
 Yeah
 Huh-uh 
 That's nice
 Nice to have it come out positive and look good
 Well we have a lot that needs be done 
 We have carpeting 
 and we did have a new floor put in our kitchen 
 And I have my mother living with us 
 and so she was in a room with a carpet 
 and of course she's quite aged 
 she's ninety-three now 
 so that meant she had problems now and then 
 and it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a linoleum down 
 So it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was 
 and so that was a really positive 
 it was fairly expensive though 
 I was impressed 
 I think that 
 we had somebody do it 
 and it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet
 Kind of depends on the quality of carpet I suppose
 but in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and fix the floor 
 so it's 
 I don't know 
 what ever 
 but they have to put stuff on the floor 
 and it's kind of a process 
 Well it sounds like you have some pretty good experiences with home repair
 Yeah 
 All right 
 Happy home repairing
 Bye-Bye
