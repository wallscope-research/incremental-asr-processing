 I'm in Rome New York
 Rome New York 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I 
 New York does not
 but they're trying to reinstate it 
 and the governor's opposed to it being the Democrat that he is and Mario Cuomo
 but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it
 I would agree with that even more 
 I don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically 
 but I'm really offended by the thought that I have to support just the existence of you know murder rapist you know right that + after they've gone and done horrible things molested children and kill them whatever that society has to pay upwards thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them
 Right 
 I don't know
 it's a hard question 
 you look at the United States 
 we have the largest murder rate of any developed 
 or 
 Here in New York it's a lot harder than that 
 it takes almost six months to get handgun permit in this state 
 Now the 
 and that's with 
 you have to have a police investigation 
 you have to have references 
 and I know because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference 
 and I know it 
 it's very easy to get you know 
 there's no restrictions whatsoever on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that which I don't consider to be the kind of crime weapon you know 
 so 
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well and the thing with Bundy was though he escaped 
 and then 
 yeah
 and did it again 
 and 
 No 
 Uh-huh
 God
 Great
 Surely there's and end to the situation
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Rome New York 
 it's up state 
 it's near Syracuse 
 it's about 
 well I actually live in a Village of Sylvan Beach 
 I work in Rome 
 It's more rural 
 it use to have a lot of heavy industry
 but it's kind of 
 all the industry has gone south
 and now the Air Force is the largest employer in the area 
 so it's Not too bad 
 you know you still have more drug problems and typical small city type problems
 but I don't know that there's a real 
 no 
 there isn't the harsh crime and all
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 I think Pennsylvania may have just reenacted it 
 because I'm from Pennsylvania also just outside of Philadelphia 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 The west part of the state is 
 and then the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases 
 so 
 Right 
 Right 
 Sure 
 Yeah 
 if your friends or family had that happen to them I think everyone would 
 they'd probably pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face as they did it
 Yeah 
 Right 
 Right
 Right
 Well [ I + yeah 
 I ] don't know 
 I think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless 
 because I guess it's a pretty rough thing to be electrocuted
 yeah 
 an injection 
 yeah 
 that would be even 
 yeah 
 I didn't even think about that
 I think 
 yeah 
 there's more that don't have it 
 but amazingly it's like Massachusetts went back and reinstated capital punishment maybe six or seven years ago
 I don't know if they've used it since they've reinstated it 
 but it's on the books
 Right
