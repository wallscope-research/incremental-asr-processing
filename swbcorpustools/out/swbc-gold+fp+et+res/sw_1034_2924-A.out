 So what do you think of our trial system 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I have noticed that that that kind of stuff does seem to happen quite a bit um 
 yeah 
 I don't I don't I don't even know what to do about that sort of thing
 Yeah 
 I think trial by jury is very good 
 I actually 
 they said I think the tape said something about changing uh changing it such that the 
 or leaving sentencing up to the judge only 
 I think that's actually good idea
 We- just just sentencing not the trial itself
 Um because I think that th- that that judges are probably more informed as to what is how serious the nature of the crime is and stuff like that 
 an 
 Right
 Right 
 so he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence in some cases there
 Oh yeah 
 the the 
 they give that as as an example of something that that might happen ye- 
 Oh yes
 Right
 Or just you know 
 there are two people who say well he just looks guilty um
 That's actually that's a wonderful way to get off jury duty you know 
 Someone says to you you know 
 when they ask you if you uh if you want to be on you know 
 when you're called for duty say oh yeah I want to be on jury duty because I can spot a guilty person a mile a way
 They quickly let you off jury duty I hear um
 Oh yeah 
 that that that that that's that's the way it works there um 
 Anyway I think that probably for for having it 
 what about you know about being unanimous 
 I mean that's sort of a strange case because I wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someone's guilty and one person doesn't 
 one person thinks that that they're not guilty 
 and they can't decide for hours unless they convince that one person you know
 I believe it does have to be unanimous actually
 Yeah 
 I think they either have a retrial eventually or or they call it a mistrial or something
 I haven't been to law school
 So I don't know much about that
 I just know that um 
 I wonder 
 'cause sometimes I think about it actually 
 I think well what if I were that one person and I was completely convinced that that that that this person wasn't guilty you know
 Right uh 
 but I mean what if eleven other people are saying one thing you know and you're you're the one person saying the other thing 
 You know would you give in
 Yeah 
 saying 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 I wonder about those things you know or even if it's you know 
 I I guess if they were to say well it doesn't have to be unanimous 
 what's the cut off number seven five you know six six
 you know how do you decide 
 Is it you know 
 how do you decide what number of people have to say that 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I've never quite understood that Um
 Okay
 Right 
 and they can't do anything about it
 Yeah 
 I often wonder about that 
 I wonder if if maybe you know 
 I I I don't I don't I don't know the law on that 
 but if they have new evidence can they can they retry 
 or can they you know bring you back
 Oh actually that's true 
 I've seen the same thing on L A LAW as well
 Yeah 
 W- 
 so I wond- and then I wonder why that you know 
 there there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that 
 yo- you know something like something like well you can't be tried for the same trial because that would bias the the the the jury or something 
 or you know 
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 In in of the defense 
 Yeah 
 well well there's also the issue of for instance you can't um you can't very often you can't um 
 when someone is is on trial for something you can't bring up prior convictions
 Which 
 Right 
 that's completely beyond me 
 I mean that's jus- 
 I wonder 
 Yeah 
 I mean if this man is is accused of raping someone then I think that something like sex you know the fact that he se- sexually assaulted someone is a crucial bit of evidence that adds to the fact 
 and I I I I I often 
 I never understand you know 
 havin- again having 
 I'm sure there are some deep seated reasons you know to 
 I mean often times I wonder about rules like this 
 and I'm sure that that that there are some reasons for good
 Right
 Then right 
 then then 
 Then they should be 
 yeah 
 I mean that's what I think 
 but I don't um but I don't quite understand
 Do I vote
 Oh yeah 
 I vote 
 yes
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Well that's that's that that's very true 
 but then again oft- often times they don't as well
 Often times they don't uh
 they just go you know 
 they're 
 you've got people like who are who are you know lame lame ducks 
 and they sort of don't care about anything and just want to go ahead an 
 That's true 
 that's true
 I often 
 I mean that that 
 like you say that's another discussion 
 but I have had that discussion before as well 
 Where you weren't 
 I I wonder about the po- politics of it all 
 so 
 Yeah
 Well even in the courts yo- well well they're all appointed 
 I mean that's even another issue you know 
 should should should judges be appointed you know 
 and or or um often times I look at friends 
 we had uh a serial killer around here who killed eleven women
 Ch- oh and and choking them 
 yeah 
 uh his name is Arthur 
 I'm not sure if they had one yet 
 but I'm sure they will 
 Um because he was he was on some sort of news special though 
 he was he was uh he killed 
 'cause he was just on trial like maybe a year ago
 Um he was strangling some of them
 Oh no 
 usually they were prostitutes actually
 Because he was he was 
 actually this is a very sad case 
 The man was let out 
 he was in prison for um sexually assaulting two children
 Right 
 he he 
 they let him out 
 and then and then he wa- he wasn't allowed back in the town where he had done this 
 so he came to our he came to Rochester instead 
 and they they they realized later he he had killed about between eleven and twelve women at least 
 and 
 Oh really
 way up north here huh 
 Oh okay 
 Still way up north sort of um
 Yeah
 Won't get out exactly 
 yeah 
 this this this man was sentenced to I think like three life times 
 But he was you know it was just horrible 
 because um his his his trial was you know was it wa- it was televised and this and that 
 and what they were pleading was um they were pleading insanity
 I mean it's clear to me the man is insane
 And and he should be just locked up for life 
 Right 
 I mean I don't know what you do with them at that point if you're that crazy 
 but what what struck me is you know they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours 
 and by the end I realized that maybe it would have been better if they had it wouldn't have been a jury of his peers but if they had a jury of psychiatrists instead to sort look at it you know
 I mean I don't think it's feasible 
 but it would be an interesting thought if you're 
 No 
 or right 
 right 
 exactly 
 but give them a bunch of psychotics but at least have a have a have a bunch of psychiatrists you know just to look at him and decide from then 
 I mean they would 
 What's th- 
 yeah 
 they did
 They had a regular trial by jury for him 
 and and
