 Okay 
 Um I guess if I had to rate it from one to ten I guess I would rate it a five in the aspect that I wouldn't want everybody to have guns 
 and I think there should be limitations of like semiautomatics 
 Uh things like that should not be just given out to anybody 
 In fact you know I can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose 
 Uh so I guess you know being that I come from a hunting family I'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles uh things that people would use for sporting type of uh a activity 
 Those would be fine 
 but when you get into a a lot of the more complex weapons I would say yes 
 we need to put restrictions on them 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Exactly 
 for self-protection 
 sure
 I can't imagine that 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 To do massive amounts of killing uh
 Yeah 
 The only thing that I can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is uh uh you know going to kill a massive amount of people or uh somebody that's escaping that's uh very dangerous
 semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and and uh get him down
 But uh you know I I think of my family 
 Uh they're very much into sporting and uh you know as far as hunting and also like uh clay pigeons things like that
 So they have may have some shotguns 
 They may have other type of uh hunting type things 
 but I figured if the if the criminals had to take a hunting gun out to kill somebody more than likely somebody would see it you know what I'm saying versus a you know a small handgun uh that can be you know put right in your coat pocket 
 and nobody would see it
 but yet you can't stop people from having you know a handgun in their home
 Even if there are small children around there's you know you can't say people with small children can't have guns 
 and people without small children that may have grandchildren you know still have these guns 
 but uh I guess I I was always taught number one a gun isn't a toy
 Uh you know and I don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you you know and don't ever play with it
 Uh so I don't know if that makes a difference or what 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 The criminals would get them I mean even if they had to go across border to get them 
 Uh-huh
 How to use you know to make sure the guns are put up as something as uh not a toy 
 Yeah 
 Because we had guns all over our house when we were kids
 and not that they were laying on the uh couch or anything like that
 but uh I never had an interest in them being in the fact that I knew that guns could kill
 and I had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns
 and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy
 and of course we were quite young 
 and we went through uh the National Rifle uh Club 
 and so we were taught you know kind of at a a good age ten and eleven and twelve to sit down with a kid and say okay 
 if you're going to learn how to shoot a gun you're going to learn how to do it correctly 
 and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and and know how to protect yourself 
 but yet have this training so that kids aren't you know 
 they have to have a certain respect for it
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Sure 
 yeah
 Yes
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think so 
 an- and I don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what
