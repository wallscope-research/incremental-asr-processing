 Uh national health insurance I think is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive
 Yeah 
 because uh the articles that I've read regarding national health service in Canada and England has indicated that uh 
 what i- 
 stay stay in line for uh four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor
 Um I see
 Yeah 
 Well I I think that uh again having gone through a period when I was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own if you don't have a company supporting you in the uh picking up the major portion of your health insurance the cost is p- almost prohibitive 
 Yeah 
 Uh we're currently where I'm working now under Blue Cross
 I don't know what the total cost of the program is 
 but for dependent coverage I'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a a month or something like that
 So I assume that probably the total cove- cost is probably three fifty to four hundred 
 They're probably picking up about half of it
 And that's a pretty good policy 
 but if you had something like one of these uh health maintenance programs
 or one of whatever the type name is H M O uh where the uh where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest If you tried to buy something like that I'm prob- it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something
 <> Yeah
 <> Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's right
 Oh goodness
 Delivery room and everything
 Yeah
 <> Yeah
 <> Yeah
 Yeah
 As to a company's benefit to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job 
 Because they don't have to worry about going in and and paying uh seventy-five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes
 <> That's a 
 Yeah 
 But here again the the doctor's practices in hospitals have gon- become fairly sizable businesses under themselves now
 Uh you take a hospital uh the physical plant itself 
 you have to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building uh when the e- rooms are empty
 So they spread the costs out over uh all the patient costs 
 and uh that's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that The horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and uh it being a four thousand dollar bill
 Right
 <> Yeah
 <> Yeah
 Yeah 
 My daughter and son-in-law had a baby here about uh what 
 he- he'll be three in August
 And uh their insurance plan that they're under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital
 And like she went in 
 she had the baby 
 and she was out in two days time
 And it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital
 the the deductibles didn't apply
 And so that's one way one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by uh 
 okay 
 if you'll shorten your stay then we will uh waive the deductible
