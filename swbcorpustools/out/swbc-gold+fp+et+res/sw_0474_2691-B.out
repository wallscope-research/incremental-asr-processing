 I live in Dallas
 uh right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state And a uh it goes east and west and a north south tollway
 It's 
 no 
 it's called Six Thirty-Five's the highway
 It's the looper that goes around the city
 and then uh the tollway is called the Dallas North Tollway
 Just moved here about uh oh uh one about a month ago after twenty-one years two miles to the east
 So it's a very different house from the typical Dallas uh house 
 It's about eight years old
 it's uh it's a duplex type thing Uh very modern and uh very open and airy light 
 So it's different than the than the long Texas ramblers
 Uh-huh
 What's your house like
 Oh great 
 yeah
 So it's got a lot of o- openness and light also
 Oh it doesn't 
 Well that's what my wife really wanted 
 and so uh 
 Yeah 
 that's 
 Uh our our last house wasn't too bad 
 but it was just too traditional
 and so if uh 
 the n- the next time uh probably a year and a half from now we're going to try to build
 So make one really uh contemporary and and very modern and very open and very light
 No 
 I have three in college
 They they usually get back for the at least two of them for the summer 
 so But 
 Still need a little bit of space 
 We we have a lot less than we had uh recently
 Already cut back
 How big is your place
 Oh that's good size
 Yeah 
 We we had 
 Yeah 
 we had four bedrooms two and a half baths uh in the place we just left
 So down now we're down to two and two
 Uh-huh 
 So it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home 
 but it won't be that long because we not for sure you know how long they're going to stay or whatever
 So 
 Oh yes
 Yes 
 and if you get in the if if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal 
 Uh we we really didn't go that route and didn't look 
 Uh but uh the planning of them 
 and the the housing market probably still going to even go lower 
 There are many many houses ju- for sale just by the regular route
 So uh 
 Yeah 
 And we just decided uh uh sell 
 And we got we got a pretty good price uh for for what we had 
 Uh not as good as it would have been say three or four years ago 
 But that uh that was just the timing
 Uh-huh 
 Oh
 Yeah 
 they're not moving very well
 For sure
 And that's a good uh example of it
 Oh yeah 
 I know where that is 
 I've been we've been here for twenty-five years
 I'm from Missouri 
 and my wife's from Kansas 
 so I te- I teach at a college here 
 So it's uh it's sort of home now
 So 
 I'm at uh one of the Brook- uh it's called Brookhaven College 
 It's one of the community colleges
 And it's just about two miles to the west of where I'm living 
 So it's very nice very convenient 
 Yeah 
 Now Richland College is out it serves Richardson and uh Garland
 And that's about nine miles to the east of here 
 So uh anyway well it's good to hear from you
 And I hope we hope we did them some good uh on their little computer dealy 
 And uh have a good life the rest of it
 Bye-bye
