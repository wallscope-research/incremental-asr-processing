 Okay 
 and I'm up in Wisconsin
 uh my name is Terry
 and uh in the small town we don't 
 but uh we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollution
 Okay 
 I'll go ahead and start recording that
 Okay um 
 just in particular here in the Twin Cities we have a lot of big corporations 
 and um I'm sure there's a lot of pollution 
 We uh 
 before moving to Wisconsin lived across from where they were um gravel pits and also where they were making tar 
 and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar 
 and it would uh 
 smell the continuous 
 you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs 
 so and it was like miles away 
 but just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution 
 and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that 
 but also um where we also lived too it was very close to a highway 
 so got a lot of fumes from uh trucks and cars 
 and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture 
 I mean it was on your tables 
 you would dust every day 
 and it was dirty um type of dust 
 I mean it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country um
 for 
 I live in a small um town now quite a ways from the Twin Cities about an hour away 
 and I may dust once a week 
 and that's all it needs versus every day when I lived in the city
 so 
 Oh yeah 
 it it comes right on through through the screens 
 the only way that you could actually live in the in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house
 and so it was quite a dirty city 
 Um if you were well protected by trees which catch a lot of the pollution then you're fine 
 but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution 
 and it's just going for miles and miles and miles 
 and it's landing somewhere with the wind 
 but 
 Sure
 Sure
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh sure 
 sure 
 yeah 
 It's 
 I mean our air quality um in the Twin Cities is a lot better than what we've heard about California and maybe in the other areas 
 but um they were always talking about the air quality of today is this you know the ozone or whatever 
 and it's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted
 and many people are too busy getting to work not thinking about Okay I could have carpooled with a friend 
 even my husband was uh talking to some of the guys at work 
 now he's uh fifteen miles away from work 
 but he was talking wouldn't it be nice to carpool 
 and the guy says Well it's too close 
 it wouldn't pay
 and so 
 Yeah 
 and 
 ex- exactly and so my husband says Well that's fine you know 
 it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and you know the gas 
 and no 
 everybody has their preference to drive by themselves 
 or if they do they they drive with one little buddy uh 
 at least it's with one person
 but most of the time people are saying forget it 
 I don't want to carpool 
 it's too much of a hassle 
 it's too much involvement
 but yet 
 Yes 
 we are 
 and I think of my daughter 
 and I'm sure you think of your children 
 and you kind of say to yourself what kind of future will they have when they think back and say well my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference
 and maybe people are trying 
 but they have to change attitudes
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Sure
 Sure
 Well they
