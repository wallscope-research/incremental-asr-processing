 Okay 
 so what kind of cars are you looking at
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah <>
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh okay
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 That's a real good deal 
 In fact my dad recently got a um a Pontiac uh believe six thousand
 and he got a demo
 And it's been a real good car
 and it's it's like new
 and it only had had very very low mileage on it
 And so I think he got a real good deal 
 Of course they're fully loaded usually
 So it's I think it's a pretty good option
 Are the uh Oldsmobiles that you're looking at are they the demos 
 or they used 
 are they new 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh <> 
 And then the Cadillac is is definitely a used car 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Oh no 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 That's what I'm thinking about on my next car is do I want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new
 or do I look for a used car that's maybe two three years old that but that's you know low mileage and in good shape 
 But I just I kind of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it 
 Is it a lemon 
 or or is something wrong with it 
 but I guess that's a risk you have to take
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 About how much do they charge to do something like that 
 do you know
 Yeah 
 that's not bad
 It'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car to find out
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Well it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because I just got mine paid off about a month ago 
 and I 
 Yes 
 I don't want to think about buying a car for a while 
 I just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and uh you know hang on to the one I've got for a few years because it's it's it's almost four years old 
 but it's still in great shape 
 I have a Mazda R X seven
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I just about could really because I think my car 
 if I continue taking good care of it it's going to hold a pretty good resale value
 and uh if I consider going the used car route and save up some money I shouldn't have too much trouble at all
 Could you hold on for just a moment
 <> Okay 
 I'm on a cordless phone 
 and I was picking up uh some background noise 
 so I just switched the channel up on it 
 I didn't want to interfere with whatever they're trying to record
 Anyway <> 
 But uh I really I really enjoy the car I have now 
 and I do want to hold onto it and and you know enjoy it while it's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever
 in fact it never has
 and uh it's been kind of nice 
 and I surprisingly enough after four years I'm not tired of the car at all 
 and I want to hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while I'm not tired of it and while I'm single and can handle a two seater for now and get that out of my system
 Because one of these days I'll be getting a six seater probably too
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh my gosh 
 Oh no
 Yeah
 Right 
 What kind of car is it
 Uh-huh 
 Are you going to trade it in on this new one 
 or 
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So she's going to sell it rather than trade it in
 That's probably the best thing
 Or maybe more than that as I've learned
 Yeah 
 When I bought my R X seven I uh best offer I got for my other car was twenty-five hundred 
 Well I turned around and sold it myself for forty-two hundred 
 So 
 You can do much better 
 I'm glad you're you're taking care of it yourself 
 I I think trading it in they just use that as additional 
 they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you're buying 
 but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in
 What I think 
 So 
 But strangely enough the best off- I mean the best bargaining I had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place I got the best price trade in 
 but it's a place in Arlington 
 and I think maybe as you get outside the Dallas area 
 I kind of 
 I bet you it's kind of what I decided 
 Well maybe because it's outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better prices 
 plus I was going through that T I fleet discount program
 Well it's before they had that
 I had gone over to Texins 
 and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the in the fleet program
 and what you could expect they said you know a five percent over cost and then options at cost and everything
 So I figured out a price based on that
 But I I guess I got a pretty good deal because I went back to the Town North Mazda right off Central and offered them the same price as what I knew I was going to be able to get it for in Arlington
 and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the cruise control
 He said You're going to get a car that's got flood damage or hail damage 
 And they just laughed at me 
 And I went the next morning to Arlington 
 and they gave it to me for that price 
 And what's so funny 
 they took the car they I knew they were going to pull it from Town North because that's where the white one was
 And they had already told me We located one at Town North 
 So it was that same car
 Yeah 
 well unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage I got the car off your lot for that price 
 Oh I did 
 And I laughed real hard when I took it in for the two thousand mile checkup
 and uh that they required you to do 
 And I took it to Town North 
 and sure enough I saw that guy 
 and he recognized me
 He said Oh hi Dana 
 and he kind of looked down and saw that car 
 and I'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day
 of course when the place in Arlington went and took the car because I told him there's a place in Arlington that's going to give it to me for that price 
 He said No they're not
 And the next day they pulled the white car and took it to Arlington 
 So I'm sure he knew 
 So I loved it 
 I sat there 
 and I just had the biggest grin on my face
 It was kind of nice
 Yeah 
 Good talking to you too Don
 Okay 
 good luck in your car hunting
 Uh-huh 
 Bye-bye
