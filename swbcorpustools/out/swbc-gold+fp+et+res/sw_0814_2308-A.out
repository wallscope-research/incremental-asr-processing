 So um well I'll tell you my situation is uh I have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home 
 And um her son which is my father is also elderly 
 and this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years 
 Now my father's almost eighty 
 My grandmother's almost ninety-seven
 So um it's strange because it it so hit so close to home that um my father's an only child
 and really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother 
 She had many sisters 
 and a couple of them took care of her 
 And then one her last sister died 
 and it was probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home Because I was pretty much giving up my life my sister was and plus she was driving my father crazy 
 She went through three housekeepers live-in housekeepers 
 So she's kind of cranky to get along with 
 There's nothing physically wrong with her except she's very very old 
 but her personality is is very grating 
 I mean I hope I don't get like that when I get old 
 So 
 Yeah 
 you don't know if their complaints are legitimate
 Um we don't have that problem up here 
 We might maybe in a rural uh 
 maybe there's a bad uh a bad home in a rural area 
 but it would be a very small one 
 Um the one my grandmother's in is very um hospital like 
 There were some really nice ones here 
 All the 
 a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations 
 Um this one is more or less for someone who's poor and can't go there 
 and my father's is he's no by no means wealthy 
 but he's quite well off
 And he could easily have put her into a nicer um home 
 but up here there's waiting lists 
 And that was the first one that opened 
 And I suggested to him Why don't you change/
 Um he said Well these people here are they are very nice to her 
 And he was saying his excuses if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice 
 So the the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it's a really trying job 
 I mean I go up twice a week to see my grandmother 
 and I know the staff very well 
 So they couldn't they can't hide anything on you or anything like that
 But I have heard of really awful conditions especially down the southern part of the st- the country which is 
 Oh that's terrible
 Well that's good 
 So is your grandmother um impaired 
 Is she of Alzheimer's or something like that
 Oh
 Oh that does happen 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 You know my neighbors across the street their mother was sick at times 
 and they they couldn't handle her 
 So they put her in a home 
 and then uh the old Frenchman he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids Oh you still need your mother 
 I guess I'll look after here 
 *[[here = her ]] And that happens a lot when people are sick or they just real manic-depressants they end up being put in homes
 and it's like oh well 
 But that's 
 it's it's 
 I'm really glad that I come from an area where um that there's good people in the homes 
 But it's just as 
 it doesn't matter if it is like you say the best place they still don't want to go to these homes 
 And my grandmother's real there 
 I mean she cries every day 
 This has been over a year 
 and she tries to make me feel really guilty 
 But I have to you know I have to put my foot down where where my life begins 
 I mean if that was my mother I would really feel a lot more responsible 
 I would probably take care of my mother 
 I don't really um 
 when my father when something 
 if anything happens to him I don't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact I don't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home 
 And hopefully that he can uh get along with uh in-house help 
 So he's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day because I think that's the best situation is when you're you get that old and you've been independent your whole life you don't want to go into a home because like I say my father's eighty
 and he's really active 
 He still has his driver's license here 
 I mean you wouldn't believe what he does 
 He actually tows cars 
 And as the years go on the tow trucks got better more easier 
 and he went out and bought himself a flat bed one 
 so he won't have to do very much work
 So someone like that they I really don't want to see them go in a home 
 He's got two dogs that are his constant companions
 and he always replaces them 
 You know I've had like over the past thirty years I've had you know about seven or eight different dogs all the time 
 And it's like 
 you know it's oops 
 Dad's got these two 
 and the old dies 
 and the young one goes for a while 
 and he gets another one 
 So I can't see him with- without his animals 
 Even though it's very expensive to stay at home mentally it's just the best thing for you
 I mean when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have 
 and I'm thinking when I get older I I I think if brought all my precious belongings with me I think I could live in a home 
 I don't want to be a selfish you know a burden on anyone 
 That's what I think because I see what my grandmother puts me through 
 and I'm saying that when I get older I could probably make the best of this place I mean 
 And of course it's institutional food 
 and everybody hates it 
 and it's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight
 It's really it's a bad thing 
 but when they go into the homes they lose weight and lik- because of the institutional food you know 
 I think it's fine 
 but you know my taste buds are pretty uh flexible 
 and here they are they're always used to these old fashioned foods 
 They're very set in their ways and used to have what they could get at home 
 and now they're feeding them um quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat
 Just 
 they don't feed them the old people food the chicken and biscuits and things like that 
 That's that's the thing my grandmother really misses I mean really growls about
 Oh
 Yeah 
 I know if if if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the in-law apartment and have it on you know one floor and really easy access 
 Well that's what I'm telling my father now 
 He needs a new floor in his bathroom 
 and I says Now is the time Redo your whole bathroom 
 so you can get in and out
