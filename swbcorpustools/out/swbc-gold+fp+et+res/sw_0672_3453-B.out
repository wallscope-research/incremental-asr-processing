 Uh no 
 somebody else answered the phone and put my number in
 Uh what is the topic
 Okay 
 Uh my next car to buy probably would be a Cadillac
 I've had uh 
 well I'm on my third one 
 And I'm not real sure that I'd be in the market for a car for quite a while
 Uh-huh
 My 
 My dad has been a a uh Lincoln man for a lot of years 
 but I've always been a G M man 
 I'm in the auto parts business myself
 And uh the last Cadillac I bought was an Allante
 And I just love it to death 
 I'm not sure I'd ever get rid of it
 I used to do that quite a bit myself
 Yeah
 Really
 They seem to put They seem to be put together a little bit better
 And you know the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products 
 and I think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from uh imports is they put so much you know gadgetry on the dash 
 and and the the buttons are so small to push 
 and G M doesn't seem to do that 
 I kind of like that feature 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I've uh I had an Eldorado was my first one was an eighty
 and uh I think at about sixty thousand miles I finally had it lined up
 And I had them do all four wheels
 That's true 
 yeah 
 But what is big today
 You know Lincoln is still as big as it always has been 
 but 
 You know a car I ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental
 Well the Town Car I noticed uh 
 or with the with the Continental uh I was rented one one time uh we could uh put golf clubs in them
 You know straight across 
 I mean 
 Front to back
 Not going from side to side
 And we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage
 I see
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I don't know if you've ever looked at a Continental
 Uh it's not as peppy as a as a Town Car
 because it's a V Six 
 but it uh 
 I too- I drove it from here to Memphis 
 and I really enjoyed driving that car 
 If I was going to buy a Ford product that's what I would buy
 You might take a look at them
 They they had a a lot more trunk space 
 As a matter of fact they had more trunk space than my uh Sedan De Ville had
 Uh all three of mine have had leather interiors 
 yeah
 Uh I had a eighty Eldorado which was leather 
 and uh then my eighty-six was a touring sedan
 And uh it had the gray leather package in it 
 and my Allante has uh I guess saddle saddle colored type thing
