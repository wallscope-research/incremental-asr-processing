 Yeah
 Well uh it's funny when I tried to make the call the other days 
 I thought 
 I hadn't seen anything since DANCES WITH WOLVES 
 but today I went to see REGARDING WITH HENRY
 It was really good 
 We 
 uh Jeff Wariner just got out of the hospital
 and uh Jeff and Deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood 
 and uh we all liked it 
 We had both moms and uh fifteen year olds and a twelve year old 
 and everyone enjoyed it 
 And uh 
 Yeah
 Well my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another A lot of the ones I had wanted to see 
 and so since he had this friend up from Houston uh and his friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this and I thought well I want to see this one too 
 So we uh I 
 finally it's my first summer movie 
 Yeah
 Oh was that good 
 Cause 
 Yeah 
 Well I want to see that and CITY SLICKERS both 
 I love comedies 
 But that's what I was 
 Oh was it
 Oh <>
 Oh well good 
 I'm I'm glad to hear that because they 
 Uh-huh <>
 Well I don't I don't know if you got to see WEEKEND um AT BERNIE'S that was out a couple of year's ago 
 They had a free showing at the Berkeley um United Artist
 And I don't know who was here or whether Jay called a friend 
 and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in 
 but we thought we'd try it you know free movie
 It was so funny and it sounds like uh what you were just describing SOAPDISH too 
 I mean we just we hurt by the time we came out 
 And the whole theater was hysterical 
 and it's just it's just goofy 
 I mean it's uh 
 if you have a chance to rent it at least 
 or it should be out on T V I would think 
 Um cause it's it's just a fun summer light comedy 
 make your cheeks hurt laughing 
 Especially in the theater it was contagious you know
 I I imagine the way SOAPDISH was but with everyone laughing 
 Well I'm glad you did that before your surgery 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Oh gosh
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah <>
 Yeah <>
 No 
 that was one uh Jay got to see with a friend 
 and so I 
 and to try and uh try and find time it's hard uh with Jim's schedule too just to get a time that we can both go 
 And uh I'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because uh we had friends that went to see that and said you know it's just perfect for our age group 
 and because I think he he needs a comedy too 
 Uh and that's what he would have liked to have seen REGARDING HENRY too 
 but knew that uh 
 we've we've got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful 
 We're really enjoying it 
 but some of the different things we're doing uh there's just not a time enough time to do it all 
 and he said well realistically You know he knew he couldn't get them all in 
 But uh Jay really liked ROBIN HOOD 
 Um when the choir group went to see BACKDRAFT and they thought that was uh it was funny cause he sounded like the critics 
 He said you know the plot line and the characters uh you know aren't real big 
 but the the fire scenes and the dra- you know that action part is fantastic 
 But he thought ROBIN HOOD was great 
 It was real different then you'd expect 
 but h- but he enjoyed it 
 and so 
 Yeah 
 me too 
 And yeah 
 I really uh like him a lot Which is why DANCES WITH WOLVES was the last movie we had seen for several months 
 but 
 It was 
 I uh 
 in fact uh a friend from Germany was visiting in March 
 and we wanted we didn't ran out of time we wanted to take him to see it 
 We were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it too 
 Uh I just thought that was terrific 
 And I really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons I wanted to see 
 And he's very good in REGARDING HENRY 
 That's not an easy part to play I I don't think <>
 Yeah 
 That's at that one won't your sides 
 Um it 
 was this the first time you got to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS 
 Or 
 Uh-huh
