 What kind of woodworking do you do
 Uh-huh
 Uh well I like to think of it as a hobby but I I guess also partly out of necessity Just repairing things around the house
 Uh a few years ago uh we needed uh they needed some book shelves 
 and I kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves 
 and uh it actually worked pretty well 
 and over the years I've I've refined those plans 
 I got myself a router 
 and I'm I'm very good at making book shelves
 It's it's also a way of relieving stress 
 My wife kind of laughs at me that anytime I get stressed out I just go out in the garage and we've got more book shelves
 Uh well yeah 
 I mean little by little I I started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things
 Uh gotten a a good belt sander 
 and and the router uh helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router
 The latest project that I've been working on {A and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months } is a a cabinet to to put a T V in
 Right
 And it that's works well because you can design it to to suit whatever equipment you have 
 so I designed a space just the right size for the T V and then the the V C R and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment
 And uh that's worked pretty well 
 Uh with uh with the router you can make nice uh 
 I guess dado joints is what it's called
 Uh And it's uh 
 That's right
 That's right
 So 
 But what I need next is a good table saw
 And I I debate whether it's better to get a uh just a straight table saw or to get one of these uh rotary arm saws
 Radial arm saw is I guess what they're called
 Uh it t- seems to me the radial arm saw is is better 
 well it it takes up less room
 I mean you you set the wood down 
 and you move the saw
 Whereas if you're ripping wood you're probably better off with a a table saw
 Yeah
 Uh that that's partly my problem now 
 I don't have room for this 
 I uh I 
 where uh where we lived before up north uh basements were were common 
 and I used to put all the stuff in my basement 
 but not so here in Texas
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Have you ever used a lathe
