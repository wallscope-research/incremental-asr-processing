 All righty 
 So uh do you think Russia's still a threat
 There you go 
 Well I think 
 h- have you ever read the book NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR
 Okay 
 you know like how uh these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other right 
 and you could picture it as being Russia versus the U S d- during the whole time 
 and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them because the people there could realize that they were the same as as themselves you know 
 the prisoners of wars were were the same as the people living in that country
 And you didn't want that to happen 
 And to me it had always been that way 
 I mean what happens is you have a government right 
 and this government controls everything right
 and then you have the people inhabiting the country 
 and these people have nothing to do with the government itself
 And these people are the same as you are
 And what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country supposedly U S or Russia attacks a country it's not going to be within the borders of the U S or Russia itself 
 Like I was telling people I'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on 
 In Lith- in Lithuania they they were announced to be a separate country 
 But yet the the government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people 
 and the U S didn't go in there and try to save those people
 You know It's like you're not going to go in there and say no 
 listen 
 there's a separate country 
 Why 
 because you're going into the border
 Right 
 Once you get into the border then there's a threat 
 But what happens is you don't mess with us we won't mess with you 
 but let's mess with the neutral countries
 You know and now it's like you know they're saying other people were were I guess other leaders were still crazier about it you know 
 like other people you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there 
 but Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere
 And the U S has 
 You know it's like they it seems like they can their their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering
 You know but I think I think the thing is is that there the thing 
 like they were saying they go you know 
 like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button But not the U S S R
 The U S S R wouldn't do it Because they got too much at stake
 Yeah
 Well My my point of view to that is is that it would have had so much I mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had 
 I mean the first you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used
 that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within you know three hours of when the weapon was shot
 Right
 And what happens is what happens is 
 suppose they get Saddam Hussein which they eventually will 
 he's got one less thing to go against him
 I mean if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because he's going to be captured and you know 
 But the U S also makes a lot of uh you know treaties with other people like saying okay 
 if you give up then you can come live in our country 
 and we'll take care of you like Marcos right
 We'll overthrow you 
 but yet you can still come live here you know
 Uh no
 No
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 And uh you know there's there's just you know 
 like people will go like they like the U S goes and goes into Panama 
 and what 
 see I don't believe in war 
 That's my thing 
 I don't believe that anybody should die you know 
 and so then you know you have 
 because what happens is 
 suppose I'm I go to war 
 and I'm holding a gun 
 and I'm just looking at myself holding a gun 
 and whoever shoots first survives you know 
 But that same person also has a family 
 and you know his parents are going to cry 
 and you know life ends there 
 and to me that's ridiculous 
 You know I mean I just don't believe it 
 I think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't 
 but it's pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down 
 and it's legal in a situation like that
 You know
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I mean I mean Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous 
 and he all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so and keep his power 
 but well 
 No 
 I I don't think so 
 I think uh they're getting they're especially getting their life back together now 
 because a lot of things that you saw on TV 
 a lot of uh inhabitants of Russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to
 A lot of like dancers and stuff like that
 They said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete 
 So it must be a beautiful country
 It's just that you know they won't let you get out 
 and when you want to get out of the country that's what you want to do
 So oh well 
 I got to go to class now
 Nice talking to you
 Bye-bye
