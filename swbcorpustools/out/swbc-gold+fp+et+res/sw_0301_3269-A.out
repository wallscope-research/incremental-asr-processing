 Real excited when I heard this 
 So far I've been trying to call all day because I keep getting these subjects like capital punishment 
 so football I love this 
 This is great 
 Well we're from Colorado 
 so we're Bronco fans 
 And um we just moved here two years ago 
 and they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here 
 and they lost again 
 That was pretty pitiful 
 but they seem to be doing pretty good this year
 Oh
 Yeah
 Well they haven't they haven't have they just lost one game this year
 Two
 Yeah 
 But they're not doing bad 
 People are pretty surprised that they I mean they beat the Giants
 I bet 
 Oh boy I bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it 
 Yep
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 well I am I'm a big football fan 
 I never wou- 
 my father was a football fan my whole life 
 and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff 
 and I just hated it 
 And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays
 And uh so when I met my husband he was watching football 
 and I figured out that I couldn't see him all weekend 
 I couldn't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL if I didn't like football 
 So 
 Yep
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well I do 
 I just I love it 
 It's such I just think it's such a fun sport 
 And uh I'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet 
 We're not convinced that we're going to be Cowboy fans yet 
 But uh 
 Well I guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here 
 That's even harder 
 But 
 No 
 we're just 
 this is only the second place we've lived 
 We've only been married for five and a half years 
 And uh we have two small children 
 and he had a uh just got transferred here to E-Systems 
 so 
 Oh
 Well I tell you this 
 the weather here and there's no mountains or anything you know 
 and when you go to a football game in Colorado that's you know there's snow 
 and it's an adventure 
 And here yeah you've just got to drive down to the to the stadium 
 and uh 
 Yes
 Well he's from here
 So Yeah 
 That's what I hear
 Which is rare
 Which is good 
 Yeah 
 But uh I 
 you know it's funny 
 in in Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three times in the last I don't know five or six years whatever it's been Um they have these songs on the radio 
 They take moder- popular songs and and change them to fit uh the Broncos and stuff
 And they had 
 I was just thinking about one the other day 
 Uh if I saw a picture of John Elway in the in the cafeteria at school um 
 but they did the Johnny Angel 
 They did Johnny Elway to that
 And and I was trying to get my son to sing that 
 My husband was just having a fit <> don't have him sing that song 
 But they they do a lot of fun things 
 I think football is football is kind of a a sport that I think you kind of it's hard not to like it 
 Because you know there's just 
 It's exciting
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 they probabl- 
 I I wish I would have bought the tape when I was in uh Te- in Colorado 
 Because uh I I think about that a lot 
 But you know when I first moved here was when they well no I guess it was about a year ago they did this 
 This interstate seventy-five song Or whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety-five and everything 
 That was kind of a funny song 
 but they sure do 
 it seems to me like they really love their Cowboys here 
 Even when they were losing pitifully you know people still support them 
 We drive by some houses everyday that have big signs 
 we love the Cowbo-
