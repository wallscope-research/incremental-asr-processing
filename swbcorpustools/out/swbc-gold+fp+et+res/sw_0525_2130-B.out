 Yeah 
 it we I I read an interesting article in the paper that discussed uh that uh 
 seemed that every other time a President tried to get support for an action like uh uh President Carter and his thing with the the hostage crisis and he always did it through rhetoric
 And this time President Bush did it through action 
 and he he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support
 or uh I mean he left almost no alternative
 And and it was very interesting how he did it 
 and uh I mean I'm I'm an Air Force Officer 
 so it uh it was interesting for me uh you know 
 I'd certainly uh 
 I I mean I think it's great that all the support 
 I have uh friends of mine from the Air 
 I'm I'm an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory
 but other engi- guys here on base 
 this is a B fifty-two base where I work 
 so we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there 
 and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it
 Yes 
 it was
 Yeah 
 I'm I don't know the exact figure 
 but I I would imagine that because of the how close the the vote was I'm uh I mean almost certainly would have to be 
 Just based on the sheer numbers of uh the disparity of excuse me Democrats and Republicans in Congress he'd think that it would have to have been um
 And uh I I 
 gosh this uh this whole thing now with all the uh all the political cartoons on the Democrats and how they're uh uh they're in in a sad way for ninety-two now in terms of the presidential election anyway
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Right 
 right 
 I think that was 
 all those factors played a part in you know uh the 
 everyone was discussing whether we should uh wait longer 
 but I I I know that there's a lot of reasons to wait longer 
 but I think we were genuinely concerned about how their military capability 
 and we uh I think we over estimated it 
 but still we were really highly concerned about it 
 and that we were worried that they were getting dug in 
 and uh 
 Yeah
 Right 
 they couldn't yeah they couldn't 
 yeah 
 it's true 
 they 
 Saddam thought he had the whole thing uh figured out to to which way we were coming and which what what our doctrine was that uh
 That's right 
 that's true 
 That's interesting 
 I think uh this political situation over there now is uh uh 
 it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the this opposition will uh uh 
 today the Turks uh agreed to support the Kurds which is something they've never done before 
 [ and + uh *[[needs slash]] And ] uh this 
 *[[%]] and the Israelis uh and not the Israelis but the Arabs all of a sudden are uh are cheering for Baker on his drive for to reconcile relations with the Israelis 
 so it's like 
 Yeah 
 I 
 No uh 
 I I think I did hear that at one time a long time ago
 because I used to live in uh Massachusetts 
 but uh 
 Yeah 
 New Hampshire
 Oh my gosh
 Uh
 Well I don't 
 yeah 
 I'd certainly uh support Israel in in their their policy that in defending themselves and in uh in their handling of their foreign policy 
 I think I think the stand they have or or the way the command respect I I support that 
 I think that is a a positive thing for them after um uh thousands of years 
 they have to uh they ha- 
 I think they in 
 when they be- became a country they more than or more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore 
 and uh 
 Yeah 
 exactly exactly 
 and uh um so gee 
 I lost my train of thought here 
 But uh um so okay 
 so I can't say whether that that I'm pro Israel or anti Israel 
 I mean I'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region 
 and looks uh that the joining of forces for this uh uh Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing
 Right
 Yeah 
 somebody's going to 
 and I think that's the problem the P L O has is that when they whenever one group of them decides that they're going to negotiate or they're going to do something they're going to try to make some peace but uh the end result is that they there so many factions of them and uh some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or they split 
 they end up being becoming divisive themselves
 Uh I 
 it's interesting
 I I'm I'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months 
 but uh that's 
 Yeah 
 I know 
 that that is almost I mean that's absolutely unprecedented 
 that was an an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the President and the State Department
 And that I mean that's never happened before
 and I don't know if it will ever happen again 
 but 
 Yeah 
 okay uh 
 I guess uh well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time
 All right
 Bye bye
