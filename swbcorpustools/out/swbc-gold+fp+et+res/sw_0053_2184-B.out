 Whoa
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Where do you work
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Do they do it like you know within hours of the <> accident 
 or is it 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that's probably true too 
 That's that's that's sort of scary
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 really 
 really
 Yeah 
 that's that's a bad situation 
 I think that probably I think most companies now as far as entry you know exams require that
 I think they should
 I'm a T I employee 
 and and and uh I'm I'm really gung ho for it 
 In fact I you know 
 some of the places now um like I B M don't allow them smoking you know in in the plant
 We we have designated smoking areas
 But um I work in sort of a building that's that's not really well 
 it's on the campus of the T I facility 
 but it's a little bit you know separated 
 We lease the building 
 And it's it's a factory environment
 And uh they they have designated smoking 
 but it's just wide open 
 it's not ventilated properly
 and I think that's bad 
 But as far as the drugs you know being in the factory kind of environment that way I think it's a it's a definite I think it's essential 
 Yeah
 In fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years 
 and uh I I was giving my boss a hard time because I kept waiting for my name to came come up you know
 they never they never called me 
 they never you know 
 and finally the day we declared war was my time 
 No 
 And so and and my boss has has gone for about like three times I think 
 And I told him he's obviously in a high risk group 
 Right 
 right 
 and of course you know they did <> specifically single them out when we started you know that they were going to do all them first
 Uh-huh
 Which I thought was interesting 
 Oh man 
 yeah
 Ooh yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh what kind of drugs did you use if you don't mind 
 Wow
 Really 
 Well it's really lucky that you got away from that
 Cause that's really downward spiral
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that's that's it
 Yeah 
 Just life in general
 Yeah 
 well well I'm definitely for it
 Plus you know you you want to think that that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share but that are not endangering your life 
 in some cases 
 like uh my husband uh several years back worked for Motorola
 And they had you know 
 I mean it was a chemical handling type
 Yeah 
 I mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know 
 like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing
 And they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals
 And that's really that's really frightening
 So I think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know on on a on a greater frequency than maybe just you know paper pushers like like I am 
 Well well you'd think so 
 but uh 
 I don't know if they do it till yet
 Because when he was at 
 course now it's been years now because it was before it was even before they had the the designated smoking type stuff you know at T I 
 I forgot what 
 I guess it was like eighty-four eighty-five something like that 
 And they at that time they had no testing whatsoever
 So that's scary 
 Oh Lord 
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 should we move 
 Ooh
 That's awful
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 peer group is the other way now instead of 
 Uh-huh 
 that's 
 Yeah 
 that it really is
 Okay
 Well I enjoyed talking to you Cathy
