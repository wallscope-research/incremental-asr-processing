 A type of work station
 Is it a two eighty-six or three eighty-six base machine
 It's eighty eighty-eight
 Okay 
 Uh <> what type of uh utilizations do you make of it 
 Word processing obviously
 Okay 
 Uh I use them both here at work and at home
 And I have I B M clones in both cases
 Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eighty-six base mach- machine 
 Yes 
 it is 
 Uh unfortunately I need all of it
 Uh for example I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size
 And that I know that uh brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to it's knees because I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it 
 and he had a two eighty-six machine
 and it brought it to it's knees Just in the ability to handle 
 And then I have uh a three eighty-six F X a sixteen bit machine at home 
 And I'm really pleased with it
 It manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and uh databases database searches
 Uh what I've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them 
 Have you 
 To try to make them more effective and useful
 Have you been uh struggling along those lines
 Well I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it 
 It's uh 
 I used it on uh some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it 
 It was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it
 The 
 at least the version I had tended to keep copies of that Of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of all of a sudden you got a disc full error Not a fun thing to try to recover from
 Very frustrating
 Uh but again I've been dealing with large files both data and and otherwise 
 Uh that was a engineering spec on B two 
 You come here with the B level of specs
 Well it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build Uh to one level down from assistant description
 Well I sure need them 
 Uh there's no way that I could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that I need to to try to do my job without them
 Yes uh 
 maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things 
 I think that's when you you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have 
 When you start seeing what all they can do for you
 Well I understand that you know 
 if needs and wants were the same I'd have a four eighty-six machine at home 
 Right
 Uh that's 
 came out around the first of the year
 It does a few more things uh than had been available before
 But I'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement Uh you know 
 once you get passed thirty-three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation Because you no longer can think that fast anyway
 Well okay 
 I enjoyed our discussion
 You do the same
 Bye
