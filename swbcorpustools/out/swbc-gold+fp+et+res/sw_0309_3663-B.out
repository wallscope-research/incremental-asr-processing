 Okay 
 Well considering you moved here from California I guess the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have down there
 Especially the last few years
 It's kind of it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it uh
 Yet 
 Generally if we're going to get them it's not going to happen uh prior to January one
 You may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in December 
 but usually the bitterest weather if we're going to have any comes in January and February
 Then by March things are getting warm again 
 so we really don't have as long a cold season I guess as people up north
 It's been eighty degrees on Christmas day here before
 Lots of times 
 No 
 it's nice 
 I just came in from outside
 and it's it's really pretty 
 It's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out before it rains again
 I'm a I'm a scoutmaster 
 and so I wind up going out camping with uh a bunch of boys at one time 
 and so it's better for us if it hasn't been this totally wet before we go 
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 we camp year round
 But uh It's uh it's definitely different
 And then I guess you've been through a couple of summers here too right
 Oh it is
 It's not as humid As Houston say or Atlanta 
 but it But more humid than Arizona 
 and California for the most part
 Were you northern California
 Central
 So that was Dry but pretty even climate wasn't it Year round fairly Not wide fluctuations
 But it's a drier 
 Hundred when you have a hundred here everybody's dying 
 Oh
 What types of What type what type of business takes you to those climates 
 or was that just vacation or something
 Oh
 Not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages
 Oh
 That's interesting
 You don't think about that as a career a normal career uh when you're thinking of things that people might be doing
 So you're you're with the home office now 
 Well the uh I think uh all in all there are a lot worse climates than Dallas uh 
 the weather you know does change fast 
 and things do happen severely a few times a year 
 but there's an awful lot of good weather too in between
 Yeah 
 and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too After the last freeze 
 and and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh I like that Particularly if I'm going to be outdoors and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things 
 And that's nicer
 Yeah 
 I do quite a bit of that 
 Think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to the east Texas 
 and it is a little more humid out there than it is here 
 so I guess we'll 
 the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains 
 There's not much between us and the North Pole 
 And then when you get one of those tornado type systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms 
 and then
