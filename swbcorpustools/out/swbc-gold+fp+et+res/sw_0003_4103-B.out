 Yeah 
 I have some friends of mine who use Quicken 
 and uh I've considered using it once myself 
 but I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date
 So I I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken at least for now
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well it's similar problems 
 but uh we just have the one check book 
 and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible 
 and occasionally we will get behind like you say 
 but uh it doesn't really seem to be too too tight if we just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced
 Well how to you handle that the long range or medium range planning on finances
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well that's pretty good if you can do that 
 I know 
 I have a daughter who's ten 
 and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point 
 but uh we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college 
 so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall 
 and then the money that I will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently uh took on a full time job well almost full time
 So it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for uh long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing
 Oh Stockton
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh a colleague of mine at uh work got some information over uh the computer network called INTERNET
 And he just forwarded that on to me 
 and uh it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in 
 so I sent back mail
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well what other long range goals do you have besides college
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
