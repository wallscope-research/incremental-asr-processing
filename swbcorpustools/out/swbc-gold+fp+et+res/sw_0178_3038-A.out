 Huh Interesting story
 I uh I don't even remember seeing that advertised 
 and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly
 Oh That recent
 Oh I see what you mean
 Uh-huh 
 Well uh I guess what I what I saw most recently and luckily I saw it only a week ago so I'd remember remember it well was uh sort of light by comparison
 Uh my husband and I had this great desire to go see a comedy 
 and and uh we ended up going to see GREEN CARD
 GREEN CARD
 And uh he chose it 
 and uh it's got this wonderful French actor who's 
 it was his like his 
 and he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years 
 but he's never made an American film 
 This was his American film debut
 and he speaks very broken English 
 And basically he played uh a Frenchman who married an American girl uh in a marriage of convenience so that he could get his green card which is what an alien needs to work in this country
 And uh because she could claim she was married she could get uh an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in New York that had a garden an an an outside garden which is very unusual there
 So she was a horticulturist 
 and that was sort of her dream
 Of course you know they got married 
 and they never saw each other again
 Except except fate through them together
 *[[through> threw]] and the Immigration and national- Naturalization Service uh started investigating 
 So they had to get back together and get their stories straight
 and and she was a very svelte sophisticated urban New Yorker
 and he was a a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer 
 but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was
 He'd been working in a restaurant when they met
 And uh they had to learn all about each other basically in a in a weekend 
 And uh it was 
 you knew what was going to happen of course That they would fall in love 
 Well they fell into like at any rate 
 and and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever uh they did perfectly 
 and then he said something because his English was so poor on for the most part 
 he he was so proud of himself for giving ex- all the correct answers that that on the last one he said oh I never remember that answer 
 and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers
 So uh
