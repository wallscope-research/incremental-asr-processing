 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 uh let's see 
 when I when I went away to school I'm trying to think my criteria 
 I guess when you're when you're eighteen or so uh it would be important to know if it was a coed college 
 That was a a strict requirement for me 
 Uh again what uh how serious a person is according to uh uh you know what what they want to get out of school and uh I guess they'd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home 
 Uh let's see uh 
 now what was the question 
 what what's the criteria for picking a college
 What advice
 Oh okay uh
 Yes
 Yes 
 and also uh depending on how uh uh adjustable your child would be or or flexible I guess it would be uh 
 if if they chose a college in a different part of the country that maybe the they were unused to their that the way they run things 
 I mean the the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges I think 
 The people are different 
 and uh you have to be more flexible and more willing to uh uh adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things 
 You know you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you're used to Uh
 You think so 
 Uh let's see 
 what else 
 Uh well climate would be 
 you know you'd have to 
 you know is somewhat 
 if uh if it's something different than the one they're used to I guess uh 
 if they're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need to go out and play all the time not be in studying If you're in Florida or California Uh
 I I'd also advise them that uh if mom and dad paid for their college that uh if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year then they'd have to get a loan to continue
 That's right
 There's 
 The the responsibility of that 
 And uh uh uh they could they could work and earn money towards college 
 Also if they stay within their state you get a lot more financial aid 
 or it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school uh 
 and like I said if they was willing to work uh in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third 
 and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is 
 By the time I have an eleven year old is my oldest 
 so it's not too far away 
 but it's 
 Oh okay 
 But it's getting there 
 I mean we still have definitely can put away the money for college now 
 Uh I would advise that that they did not have a car at college 
 They would 
 Yes 
 I'm here
 No
 I think so too 
 I think I think because most kids don't have a car at college the ones that do get taken advantage of 
 and you know there is just I think it's just trouble waiting to happen 
 So I would advise they didn't they didn't take a car 
 and uh they didn't take a television 
 and they didn't take a refrigerator 
 Maybe that 
 No 
 I I 
 Yeah 
 we didn't have
