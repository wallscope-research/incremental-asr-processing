 Go ahead
 Do you work for T I
 Oh 
 Oh okay 
 Oh all right 
 Well see we have the testing already here 
 We've had it for oh about five years
 It used to just be for new employees 
 And now it's for all employees 
 They uh randomly select employee numbers 
 and uh the day that they select you is when you have to go and and be tested
 So we're familiar with it 
 Oh we have a lot of um people upset about it at the beginning Some not all 
 But what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse Um mainly the areas whe- where they were doing a lot of um manufacturing type things 
 and what they ended up doing is uh kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening 
 and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing you know on the premises
 Well yeah 
 it was you know combination of of uh both activities and uh and using too 
 so they developed this uh drug policy so that uh to eliminate 
 there's some parts of the company that we do uh government contracts 
 and I think some of those require the drug testing 
 but now T I thought well we'll just do it for all employees that um not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in 
 and that we shouldn't have um people on drugs within our you know offices and such
 I haven't personally ever been tested 
 but I don't have a problem with it
 No 
 but one thing that to to me was um going on stretching it a little too far was that they also check um if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug 
 You know it happens a lot of times 
 like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever 
 and you know then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the you know doctor and get another prescription 
 Well according to what they do at T I if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name 
 It you know it can't be in your spouse's name 
 so they will look I mean the testing will look for I guess any kind of drugs 
 and you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for
 Right 
 Yes 
 yes 
 When you get tested you are supposed to tell them you know everything that that might be there 
 And then if they ever um question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name
 Well what they wo- be testing for are the ones that would have like you know barbiturates or codeine things like that in them
 Right 
 right 
 I guess that's what i- they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and an- antibiotics and stuff 
 They would be looking for the yeah controlled things barbiturates amphetamines 
 Right 
 right 
 You pretty much you know put down what you remember even if it was just Contact or something like that 
 But afterwards uh maybe if you had a controlled substance Well 
 you you probably put down you know you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it
 No
 I'm just saying you probably pro- put down on the sheet anything you have taken 
 But if they had a controlled substance maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name 
 I know I had one contract employee through Manpower was not a T I person but was a contract person 
 and they test them too even if you are not a real uh T Ier 
 If you are a contract employee here they test you too 
 And he had taken some kind of um oh you know uh 
 just he had some kind of flu or something 
 He got a real bad migraine 
 and he took his mother's
