 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 So you like a a variety
 Sort of easy listening because you like country 
 but then 
 Um
 Oh uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I I like some of his songs though 
 They're they're not so they're not so sad country all the time 
 They're just kind of sweet sometimes
 You know I mean they're not the the typical country where they're just you know my wife left me my dog left me you know 
 Yeah 
 my truck's broken down 
 and my house just burned down you know
 But 
 No
 Uh-huh
 Are d- are you do you play the piano 
 is 
 or you just like it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it must be fun to be able to play it 
 and you know if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be it'd be kind of fun I think
 because I mean I play the flute 
 and not many things you can play that'll you know people will sit there and sing along to 
 and you can't sing along either 
 so but uh I like a lot uh 
 I like classical music just because of the 
 when I I don't play 
 I like jazz music 
 but 
 What's that
 What's that
 Yeah 
 I like a lot like 
 I like uh is it the New Age music like with uh uh the 
 I don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection
 Yeah 
 I love those too 
 They're just so relaxing
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Isn't that nice 
 I mean it's nice when you have a piece that that is so so peaceful that everybody likes you know 
 and uh it it it it you know it has pieces that are uplifting 
 but it it's mostly relaxing 
 and you don't because it doesn't have words you know you don't feel like there's anything you have to remember you know as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean 
 or but uh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh I see what you're saying
 Yeah
 I I can't identify them either 
 I just like them 
 I could I know which ones come next 
 but I don't even know their names 
 Most of them I don't know their names of the song 
 but I I can identify them 
 But I like that 
 and I like uh course I I like classical music
 And uh 
 I was in the band 
 yeah
 and I was in like chamber music groups and stuff 
 so I'm used to pieces 
 and and I played classical flute 
 I didn't play play jazz flute or anything like that 
 so I c- I can relate to it I suppose 
 But uh and I like I'm like you I like the older stuff too 
 because I like Chicago
 and I like I like uh uh let me think who uh 
 I like uh Hebert uh oh 
 *[[listen; two utts]] you don't know Hebert Laws 
 but Hebert Laws a flute player 
 he's a jazz flute player 
 and I like uh uh Chuck Mangione 
 do you know who Chuck Mangione is
 Yeah 
 I like Chuck Mangione 
 Trying to think of all uh oh 
 what's his name plays the trumpet 
 Uh *[[slash error]] Yeah
 Yeah 
 I like Moody Blues 
 I I like mostly the older groups I think 
 Oh c- 
 but we do have 
 I like Simply Red 
 we got Simply Red 
 I figure all our C Ds that we have what I really like 
 And uh I like Breeze 
 I like the group 
 I think just because [ they all sort of sound + they sound l- a lot like r- uh Simply Red 
 If I'm going to listen to that kind of music nowadays that's it's easy listening *[[slash error]] Uh
 No 
 it's it's got people singing 
 but it's it is instrumental 
 But it's it's got people singing 
 but it's got a like a whole bunch of people singing
 You know how many people are in Simply Red Stuart <> <> 
 he can't hear me 
 I I don't remember how many people 
 but it's it's got men and women 
 and it's not it's it's nice 
 I mean it's pleasant you know music 
 It's not where it's it hurts your ears to hear it 
 But it's not as it's not like uh Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it 
 You know it doesn't have like all the brass and everything
 Yeah
 Oh you must live in this area
 We're in Sherman
 Oh okay 
 You're going to Commerce
 For East Texas or something
 Oh okay
 Oh okay 
 Well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas 
 That's why I was just w- 
 Yeah 
 East Texas is recruiting for you know their fall semester 
 and they're they've been doing a lot of that in the area
 No more huh
 Well right now I'm just a homemaker 
 but I'm going to school uh for legal assistant 
 and that's what I know 
 so and uh just nothing basically 
 No 
 no 
 it 
 no 
 I don't go to East Texas 
 I got a degree from T W U 
 but I'm really interested in legal you know in the legal environment 
 but I don't want to be a lawyer 
 so I said well I think I'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant
 Oh uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's how it works
 And this is the man that was in front of you
 Oh well they'll weed him out
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well not necessarily 
 but there's probably something else that might make you 
 Because you could know about you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for j- the jury 
 I mean pretty much a lot of people would know about it you know and and know some of the different things about it 
 but uh they they might weed you out some other way 
 You know if you if you don't believe like if this was a capital crime and and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty you're not going to be picked at all
 So but 
 Yeah 
 so see there there they would have a doubt about you that you know 
 because if that's what if that's what the punishment is in that in that instance then you're always going to say you know not gui- 
 you're you're not going to want to have him have that cri- uh that punishment 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Well especially with something where you have to f- you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt 
 You have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
 and it's like do you really feel that sure about
