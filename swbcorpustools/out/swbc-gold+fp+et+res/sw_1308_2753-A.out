 The Latin American situation in 
 the last development I know of was the military and financial assistance Columbia for the for the drug uh control 
 And I support that fully 
 I'm not sure we have the right solution to it 
 but at least we're we're going to the source of the problem 
 And the source of supply 
 Uh the problem is here 
 but the source of supply is there
 In fact I think a lot of the 
 I've been to uh Peru several times
 I've never been to other parts of South America 
 but uh I have been to Peru 
 and they need some assistance down there 
 and I'm sure that uh as an undeveloped country they look look for it 
 but there is not exactly a lot of uh physical responsibility there
 *[[listen; probably 'fiscal' not 'physical']] Yes 
 right
 And I I think that uh they need guidance and assistance 
 but they need to learn how to stand on their own own two feet also
 Uh-huh
 Oh no the and the poor are extremely poor 
 I know 
 I know uh some of the areas in in Texas seem poor 
 but until you've seen some of those uh native Latin Americans come down from the hills you can't imagine what poor is 
 And uh the worst scene I've ever had I think was uh someone eating out of out of a garbage can on the streets in Lima Peru
 Oh yes 
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Oh the there's a joke 
 the the graft and the uh payoffs down there are are an accepted way 
 and in a way 
 And there's there's a sad joke 
 I guess all jokes are really sad 
 but there's a joke about the uh Ambassador from Latin America that came to visit a Senator in the U S and was taken to his home for dinner 
 and the uh home was palatial 
 They had five or six servants you know and and a lot of expensive uh holdings and all that 
 and the Ambassador said but I know what you make as a U S Senator 
 how can you afford all of this 
 And he said come I'll show you 
 and he walked out in the backyard 
 and the uh Senator said do you see that hospital over there 
 And the Ambassador said yes 
 And he patted his pocket 
 and he said fifteen percent 
 He said you see that school over there 
 And the Ambassador said yes 
 and he pot patted his pocket and said fifteen percent 
 so 
 so the next year the Senator went to Latin America to visit the Ambassador and was treated to dinner in his home 
 and it was twice as large and four times as many servants 
 He said well I know how poor your country is 
 how can you afford this uh in such a poor country 
 and he he said come I'll show you 
 and he walked out the backyard 
 and he said do you see that hospital over there 
 And the Senator looked 
 and he couldn't see anything 
 he said no 
 And the Ambassador potted patted his pocket and said one hundred percent 
 so 
 Yeah 
 that 
 it's a sad story 
 but 
 Yes 
 yes 
 but it uh it is a problem
 Uh-huh
 Um 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Well the oth- the other instance I think of their inability to to handle things the cholera and hepatitis epidemics now in in Latin America 
 And it shows the the unpreparedness for such such a problem
 And yet they're so 
 Yeah
 And they're they're so rich in resources there 
 They're very rich in oil and gas 
 And they're very rich in gold and silver and very rich in in uh natural resources such as the fish and uh timber and and copper and all types of uh resources 
 but they 
 Yes 
 and 
 but they don't have 
 it's sort of like Russia 
 they don't have the ability to develop it
 Right 
 And they they're very 
 You're you're exactly right
 Uh-huh 
 It it's sort of illustrated by the uh World Bank and International Monetary Fund not wanting to continue to do business there 
 because they offer assistance then don't get repaid
 So it's sort of a thumbing of the nose uh approach 
 They need it 
 and they need to live up to certain regulations and expectations 
 but uh then don't 
 Of course it's a very volatile government uh situation too
 Uh-huh
 You know 
 Uh-huh 
 Well the 
 The solution discussed at one time and I think it has real merit on the drug situation is that the g- the U S government could spend less money by buying the crop and destroying it than they are in trying to to beef up the military and to do all other things 
 I think it would be cheaper to buy it and destroy it 
 which would still give the uh the grower in Columbia and elsewhere in Latin America the uh the money that they apparently need and go go to the illegal crop for 
 And it would save the U S money in in the long run in how much they're trying to do
 True
 No 
 no
 And I I think finding an alternate to that would be very good
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Argentine beef 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Well have we come up with a solution yet Salina
 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Well one of these days uh I hope we'll find some some way to substitute the good crops for illegal ones
 I agree
 Yes 
 it has
 Very good 
 All right 
 thank you Salina
 Bye
