 Yeah 
 I guess uh uh it's an easy one for me 
 I think that's uh there's something seriously wrong 
 yeah
 Uh I guess uh I think they've lost their compass 
 and uh I'm not sure they know exactly what uh uh public education supposed to be for anymore 
 But uh I voted with my feet 
 and uh my kids go to parochial school
 So uh 
 Well one hundred percent of the uh customers care 
 That's one thing 
 Everybody cares about the education the kids are getting 
 And uh they uh take an active relatively active part 
 Which uh I mean if you're uh sending two thousand dollars that way every year you uh watch what goes on and you uh uh pay attention and participate 
 and and you can influence the way things are
 Yeah 
 The immediacy just isn't there
 And uh uh I also think that one of the problems 
 and actually I don't think this I think this is a cultural problem 
 The uh problem with public education is really uh really a problem with the culture 
 And I guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school 
 and you can't get a tax levy passed 
 Uh people are uh reluctant to pass uh school tax levies even uh when the money is needed or would be well spent because it's uh they don't have kids in the schools
 I think that's a a loss of civic virtue and a loss of uh uh the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids 
 I think that's uh that's the principal problem is that uh people no longer see it as uh as their problem 
 and there's an immediate problem
 Right 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 You know I I believe that the original idea of public education in the United States which I guess was controversial at the time of the constitution 
 Uh you know it barely made it 
 I think it was added afterwards 
 I think the real the principal was uh education for civic participation
 The idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter 
 and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes
 Well that's exactly what I was going to say 
 Now there seem to be really three reasons for education 
 One is education for civic duty 
 One is education for economic reasons 
 And one is education for civilization 
 I mean and I think that one 
 That's what I used to think education was all about when I was a college professor 
 and then I quit and got disabused of that notion 
 But uh the uh uh now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is uh an economic enterprise to train people for jobs 
 And uh I'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is 
 And I'm really sad to say this 
 I never thought I would have 
 but I really think that uh the educational establishment has become part of the problem 
 And uh that's why I guess I'm sort of reluctantly uh in favor of these uh choice programs
 Right 
 That's what
