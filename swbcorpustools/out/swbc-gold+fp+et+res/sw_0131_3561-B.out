 All right 
 well 
 Right
 Uh are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term
 Yeah 
 I I think that you're absolutely right there 
 The other thing is is that we've got these um these all these bank defaults going on and and savings and loan defaults and and uh uh 
 Right 
 Exactly Um
 Exactly 
 and and uh so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come 
 Um I'm not really uh sure that I even understand why the administration is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if if if they're talking about reducing uh the tax that needs to be paid or the tax that's currently being paid then that can't it seems to me it can't possibly you know help with the the deficit picture
 Yeah 
 exactly
 Yeah 
 exactly
 Yeah 
 it see- seems like it's it's a kind of a Catch Twenty-two 
 I mean it's it's the um 
 my understanding is what they're try- what what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes they'll have more money to spend uh 
 and if they have more money to spend then that will be a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity uh which in turn will generate revenue 
 But it it seems like like uh it's sort of a uh a sp- an unending spiral 
 and it it it uh 
 I'm I'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the uh the idea that that uh that decreasing taxes particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to uh result in substantial amounts of money you know for consumers to spend 
 And uh 
 Yeah 
 it uh it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I think that's been a positive development 
 I think what that's done is it's it's it's help keep inflation from um uh 
 Yeah 
 exactly
 It's a sort of a piece of luck
 Yeah um 
 I don't know 
 what kind of things do you think can be done in in uh in the long term
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I think that I think that that I agree with you certainly in the second situation
 and I think certain entitlements I I'm inclined to agree with you too 
 Education happens to be one place where I think that we would foolish to um uh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh I see I see what you're saying
 And then they and then the people default on the loans 
 Well I would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that uh around uh 
 and I I I can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing 
 but but taking what you're saying at face value then I would have to agree with completely
