 I pay a good deal of taxes I guess because I I make a fair amount of money 
 and uh the taxes that I pay um I guess as a as a general statement I feel I I guess I get my money's worth for
 I'm not sure though whether I feel 
 I guess I am sure that I feel that in general though uh the allocation uh of the taxes in certain areas i- isn't correct
 Well I I 
 lately I guess um uh or at least for the last twenty years or so I've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost uh defense items at least in the last ten years have been uh 
 there's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there 
 and I'm not really sure that that we've gotten our money's worth there uh regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm uh Desert Shield uh situations
 Uh I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi- military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh I've found that you know there's an extraordinary amount of waste 
 I take that as a as a given in any military operation 
 and 
 yeah 
 and I gue- 
 I I should imagine that that that what the what the problem 
 why I I'm I'm a little concerned about today is that this uh rather uh quick and and easy I don't know I shouldn't say easy rather quick victory in the in in the uh Mideast uh uh over the uh Iraqis uh might lead us into uh a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe 
 I'm I I don't know what other foe that would be 
 but uh I I'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area
 Yeah 
 but it it it 
 would that be uh 
 well let's see 
 two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent Uh 
 I I should imagine that that would be to keep it at a level those levels I guess that that were originally appropriated w- was when the Soviet threat I guess was perceived as being a greater one 
 I don't think there's very much of a threat there today 
 I do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in the territories uh in their territory over there and who's controlling them 
 but 
 I I don't know what amount of what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic I guess from doing anything uh that would be irrational
 Right 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh what is the name of that
 Yes 
 yes
 Yeah 
 well uh I'm 
 what I'm 
 uh I guess uh it 
 concerned about 
 talking about the taxes in general and that that was an area that I I perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for uh in the area of defense 
 or perhaps we have paid too much there 
 I don't know 
 it just seems to me that over the years now the 
 and and it's it's a cliche 
 I I 
 but I see it myself 
 I see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways
 I I I don't know uh 
 I kn- I'm familiar with some some upbeat school areas 
 so I don't totally agree with the the great uh uh with the with the great ex- expenditure of effort and time there 
 but I guess overall because I guess I'm not associated with what ghetto schools and and uh and uh rural school systems are like I I should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure
 Uh-huh
 They they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system
 or is it all funded out of local taxes
 Yeah
 Sounds like the way the federal and state system works now
 Yeah 
 Uh do you mean a a complete reversal Because I guess they can't raise that money in those those poorer districts huh
 Yeah
 Yes 
 I see what you're saying 
 Uh I uh I I do I I guess I am a s- uh a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education 
 I mean by that I mean I'm a product myself 
 I have uh a a a a background of uh being uh getting my college education through the G I Bill
 What 
 but uh when I look at it to me uh it doesn't really make any difference 
 It was a marvelous opportunity that I couldn't have done 
 I don't think I would have gone on unless I had that financial uh easement made possible
 And I I don't really care what it takes to qualify whether you're uh an an ex- whether you're a veteran or whether you 
 I don't even know if you have to perform community service 
 or unless uh or or you promise to even do something in the future I think that uh the that that the subsidy itself 
 or I guess the enactment of that form of legislation would give many people who I I think I think I perceive the fact 
 at least what I read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their uh out of their uh budget 
 I know in the state of Florida just today uh the the legislature uh adjourned 
 and uh they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the in the uh state land grant colleges which which isn't I mean 
 to me it doesn't sound like a mo- lot of money 
 but I guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year
 They went from eleven to fifteen hundred
 and uh for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty-five per cent 
 I don't know what that would be
 But that uh I guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to uh was expending so much money on defense uh that that the program now is a uh program now is uh 
 fees that that fund these things I guess that's trickled down to the states 
 and the states now establish uh don't have enough money 
 so they they must charge fees Uh 
 I I'm not too sure of that reasoning
 But I guess to get back to the main topic I don't know whether I pay too much taxes 
 I I I travel extensively in Europe and see enormous uh 
 people p- pay uh a great deal in taxes 
 they tell me when I sit and talk to people 
 there they tell me they they 
 some states they pay uh 
 in Germany or in in England in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to six- fifty-five percent of their gross income in taxes
 But but I'm not too sure when I put my property tax in my car tax my income tax and these myriad of uh 
 now it costs me money to leave the country some sort of a tax to leave the country some sort of an airport departure tax uh uh a tax a sales tax which is getting to uh quite high levels 
 I'm not sure that I'm not up fairly close to that
 You really think so
 But I mean w- what's what's happened here is is is 
 I feel that that in the last ten years uh my taxes have gone up 
 they haven't gone down 
 I pay ex- uh quite a bit more taxes 
 and and and 
 but that's been a Republican government for the last ten years
 Well I 
 Yeah
 Okay uh 
 I guess I just push something here 
 Push one again right
 Just hang up 
 Okay 
 Don good talking with you
 Bye-bye
