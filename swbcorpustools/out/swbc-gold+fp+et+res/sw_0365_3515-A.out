 Uh we do here 
 Uh see what do we recycle 
 We they recycle 
 they have bins
 and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and uh plastic bottles 
 and I think that's all they have
 What about you guys
 Uh-huh
 Really
 For smashed cans
 Uh-huh
 Oh can you can you hold on for just a minute
 I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that I pressed it hard enough because okay just succeed 
 Oh okay 
 well I guess I guess 
 Yeah 
 Okay 
 well anyways you guys only get a penny a can 
 Well when you buy like uh canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit
 Yeah
 Exactly 
 and so it's like they charge you for the deposit 
 so when you turn in the cans unsmashed you're just like reimbursed
 Type of thing
 That's sort of nice though 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 so you guys can actually get ahead 
 But uh they have sort of like uh things that you c- you're not like reimbursed for or paid for 
 Like we can recycle uh clear glass brown glass green glass Uh and milk jugs and uh newspapers you know 
 everyone does newspapers
 But that that kind of stuff
 But they they said they can't be smashed or else uh 
 it doesn't fit in their little containers 
 and they're not reimbursed by the the people who are over them or something
 Yeah 
 Exactly 
 yeah 
 send it to this address 
 no 
 But uh let's see 
 they said that how ways can encourage recycling uh
 Yeah 
 that's 
 Uh-huh
 As likely to do it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 exactly
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's good 
 Uh another thing I thought of I guess to recycle would be like clothes because I mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other 
 And one way that we do it sort of in in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops
 And that way you know you don't get near enough as as much as you bought it for 
 but you you got the use out of it 
 and what you're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for
 And so that's something that I've never 
 I we're we're new to Iowa 
 so that's something that I hadn't you know looked into before 
 But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle I guess
