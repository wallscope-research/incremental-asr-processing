 Uh- well about nursing homes and and older people 
 Uh my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother
 and they're just really close here 
 And his mother has bad health too 
 and so I go over sometimes in the day when he's at work 
 and I um help with her and bathe her and feed her
 And uh and I that's hard to be a caretaker I really believe 
 It's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty-four hours a day
 Uh i- she has Alzheimer's and does not remember uh a lot if anything
 And so she asks the same questions over and over again Which is not un- you know unrealistic 
 Um and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question
 Uh I uh 
 some nights his mother calls me and says can your family 
 and just bring the kids in the family 
 and just come over and and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented
 She's ninety-two
 Oh I think that's wonderful
 Well 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I was just going to say
 Yeah
 Um
 Yes
 Uh I think it's wonderful these these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily 
 but they can go and reside there like little apartments places in between places 
 And I like that idea if they can handle it themselves 
 Um 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 <> Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Nursing homes
 Visit
 Uh-huh
 They don't go and see them 
 That's right
 That's right
 You know um I I think nursing homes are are um some are good
 I have to say that
 But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children
 Um
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 I hope so
 You know it's I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there
 And then if you find out that they are not having good care you know I'm sure that it is just you know you'd pull them out of there so fast
 And uh and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker I don't uh 
 it's a very very hard decision I think
 <> Uh-huh
 I think that's right
 and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment
 Now I know a friend of mine who had a father uh she brought to her home uh to live there 
 but he needed the medical treatment 
 and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to to help him out
 And that might be a partial solution or something 
 But um I personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before I think I'd ever 
 Yeah
 <> Yeah
 Well I I think we kind of are along the same lines
 Good to hear from you
 Have a lovely day
