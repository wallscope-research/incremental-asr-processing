 So what is your opinion on on drug testing
 Well yeah 
 it it it's just not the com- 
 you're talking about company's liability
 If if uh if the company is liable for something that that a employee does while under the influence of of a drug you know then by all means they should have the right to to to <> to to minimize their liability 
 And there's also the case about just uh uh health health and welfare of the uh employees
 If a company has a healthy work force their insurance rates are low
 And not only a- not only low there's all sorts of a of a benefits uh financial benefits associated with having you know having people file fewer claims being sick 
 There there's the whole question that that a that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy 
 I don't think anybody would argue with that
 Right
 Right
 Well wel- 
 the ques- 
 Right 
 The question becomes what do you do about somebody who tests <> who tests positive
 D- 
 that's where the real sticking point comes in
 It's not 
 I don't think there's any problem with testing people
 It's what do you do with the information
 Right 
 Right 
 Well yeah 
 I think clearly the person who is the line own- the line manager 
 the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing 
 That should go to an entirely different uh agency within a corporation
 Uh
