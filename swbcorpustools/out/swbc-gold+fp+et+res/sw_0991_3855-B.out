 Okay
 Oh we use them for paying our gas and for paying uh just about anything because um we don't like to pay for our checks 
 So we use it quite a bit
 but we we pay off every month though 
 so we never have to pay interest 
 and we always we never get the the credit cards if there's a monthly or a yearly charge 
 We always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free 
 So we never have to pay anything extra
 Yeah 
 we just don't think it's worth it 
 So 
 See well you I don't do it either 
 Yeah
 Yes 
 exactly 
 that's how I fe- 
 I mean it's a rare day when I even have seventy-five cents in my purse
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 because it's really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something
 Yeah 
 and I think it's more convenient too in a lot of cases 
 like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our our Visa or our Mastercard or whatever
 And then um you know we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later
 and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it 
 we come out a lit- even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 even if it's five bucks even
 Yeah
 And also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within I think it's twenty-four hours you can report it in 
 and I he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had 
 and if whoever tried to uh you know credit it to the hilt you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it 
 and then you know you can have your card back with pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever
 I know
 Yeah 
 exactly
 Yeah 
 sure 
 I mean it's just a precaution for everybody
 Yeah 
 so 
 Um
 Oh I also use like to use Discover when I can because they give you some money back every year
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Well we just started doing that 
 and you know what 
 it comes in handy for when you're buying things like um tickets for the train or um airplanes because they'll give you some money back you know 
 and it's only a little bit 
 but I mean it's still something 
 We got two fifty last year
 and so it's you know it helps out here and there 
 So 
 Yeah 
 they give you I think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesn't sound like a thing 
 but when you you know when you add up everything you've you've charged up on the Discover card for a year 
 and they give you a half percent of that 
 and that adds up to you know two fifty or something
 And so that's what 
 and I know we're going to get back more this year because they you know we spent a little bit more probably 
 and they do it for how long you've been a member I think too
 and they increase the percentage a little bit
