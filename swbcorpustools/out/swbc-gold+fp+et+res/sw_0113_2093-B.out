 Yeah 
 I have quite a few of those that my uncle made
 As you know I think it's more like the mess you make isn't it 
 You don't have to worry about cleaning it up
 Well when I have time I do like to sew 
 um I had been doing a lot of crocheting 
 I make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them
 My mother was real heavy into crafts 
 and I would help her with whatever she happened to be doing 
 and then she would go to these uh arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework
 So a lot of times I'd help her with that 
 I haven't had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately 
 we've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going
 Oh yeah 
 it's been beautiful this last week 
 but 
 Yeah
 I usually start in the fall
 And my husband says I do it you know make afghans so I can keep my lap warm
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I found one that's real easy 
 it's it's um um um 
 shoot I can't even remember the name of it now 
 but you make it in strips 
 And it's real easy to do 
 and it's just that it doesn't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that 
 but it's 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Mile a Minute 
 That's the name of it
 Mile a Minute
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Usually single crochet would is is always starts it off
 If we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other don't worry about it 
 We have a a very small phone company down here
 And my husband says that's called rinky-dink 
 No 
 no
 We can't have that down here 
 We get disconnected all the time
 Yeah 
 well it gets a little aggravating 
 I've got kids all over the United States 
 and and you know sometimes they get disconnected when I'm talking to them
 Yes 
 We planted um potatoes and onions and bell peppers
 Uh what else did I get in there 
 and jalapeno peppers
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 oh my husband doesn't like them either 
 but I can always give them away
 Besides they're fun to grow 
 Supposedly after the soil warms up
 Uh-huh
 I I doubt if zucchini is in there
 Probably the same time the the other squash is though
 Yeah
 About the same time that you plant okra because it's supposed to be warm
 Yeah
 We decided this year 
 I'm sorry 
 go ahead
 Oh just any time
 All right 
 Well I've enjoyed talking to you 
 Okay 
 Bye
