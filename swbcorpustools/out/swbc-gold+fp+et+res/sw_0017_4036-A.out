 I think that uh one uh advantage of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted
 Um and I think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that 
 I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that uh you uh would have a problem uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted
 Have you ever served on a jury before
 Oh okay
 Uh what sorts of cases were they
 So were they criminal or civil
 Oh okay 
 What uh what was the verdict 
 Did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision
 Yeah
 So did it become 
 Yeah
 Uh
 Uh But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right 
 You just needed a majority
 What was what was the other case 
 That was also civil
 Yeah
 Oh didn't really even count
 Yeah 
 I'm I'm a college student 
 so I haven't been you know a jury eligible age for very long
 um and uh I did get one summons actually at one point 
 but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student because it was uh a very bad time
 Yeah I mean I I really I would like to uh to do at some point um 
 but I I haven't 
 Uh one one thing that I I think is um you know maybe is a problem is uh I I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now 
 but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well 
 Especially sort of 
 How wha- 
 Uh you thought it turned out pretty well
 Yeah
 Oh so it was just kind of a zoo 
 and the jurors just sort of 
 someone had to figure out what was going on
 Um That's interesting 
 Did it did it work out pretty well in the end 
 I mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial 
 or 
 So it work- it did end up working out pretty well
 The one thing I sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh whether especially sort of in uh maybe like pro- product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes 
 you know it's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy 
 and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract 
 it's sort of a matter of um you know sometimes getting into very technical issues 
 and I wonder if uh if there's really um if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion
 In in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind 
 So 
 Yeah
 Uh
 Oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it 
 and he hadn't made the payments
 Yeah
 Uh so they were suing to get it back
 Uh
 Yeah
 Uh
