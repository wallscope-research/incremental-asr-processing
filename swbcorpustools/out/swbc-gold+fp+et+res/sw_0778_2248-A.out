 All right 
 Now we used to be big time campers 
 but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports
 Well when we before we had kids we was in a motorcycle group you know 
 w- we went like twenty or thirty at a time 
 We took uh just our little tents
 and we did it that way 
 Then when we started having children we bought a camper You know 
 and we did it that way
 So we've always enjoyed camping
 Uh-huh
 Ye- yes 
 Now we have friends with a van
 and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van you know
 Like one night 
 and the next night they'll stay at the motel you know or something like that
 And they enjoy it
 Oh
 yeah 
 Oh me either
 I hate to be on all that stuff 
 Oh yeah
 Oh
 Yes 
 yes
 Oh 
 But now I enjoy it every once in a while 
 I mean it's not something I'd want to do real often
 I'm a sissy
 I either want to do it in the fall or spring
 You know
 Yes
 Well not really because usually it's when we go off you know like for a couple weeks or so
 It's usually like that
 Just about
 Just about
 Oh it really is
 It really is
 Also I said we mostly did ours before we started a family
 It's a lot easier then
 Oh uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 I'd like to go anywhere 
 You know I just like to go
 I really do
 No
 not really 
 not that much 
 Um we've been well we've been to Wyoming you know and Kentucky and Montana and you know places like that 
 But usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long
 You know like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on
 But now that we have children and we go every blue moon I'd rather just go to Galveston You know 
 Yes 
 yes
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 It is 
 My children really enjoys it 
 They really do 
 But by the time we really get a chance to it's July you know
 and it's so hot
 And our camper do- doesn't have an air conditioner
 Yeah 
 it's one of those pop-ups 
 I'm sure you could put one in probably
 but we hadn't did that
 Yes
 we all enjoy camping 
 And they're you know they're in like and scouts and stuff like that you know so they get to go camping in those organizations also
 At least their Daddy goes with them 
 I don't when they do that 
 But That really is
 Well how old is your boys your children 
 Uh-huh
 Oh yes
 Yeah 
 Yes
 It really is 
 Mine's eleven and eight
 So they really enjoy it too
 Yeah 
 yes
 Yes
 Oh 
 But I have uh brother-in-law and a sister you know that just really just camp 
 You know they love to go camping
 They could they would all the time they wanted you know wanted to because there's nothing holding them back
 But I'm just not that involved in it
 Yeah
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Me I haven't really as far as entertainment 
 I don't know what you would do every you know 
 But I guess my entertainment's television I guess 
 Uh-huh
 Oh I don't either 
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 But they probably live in a city also 
 don't they
 Well see we're in a real small county area
 and you know that makes a big difference
 Because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles you know 
 That makes a difference
 It was nice talking to you too
 and we'll probably be talking to you again
 Oka- okay 
 bye-bye
