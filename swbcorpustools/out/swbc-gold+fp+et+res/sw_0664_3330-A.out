 Jay um 
 my kids are are both in college um 
 and I'd I played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go 
 On the other hand they really decided themselves
 Um what what kind of experience did you have
 Uh-huh
 Um
 I see 
 well I may maybe I'm wrong 
 but I think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and and and the appropriate support environment and things like that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Did did you play a a strong role in helping them pick schools 
 or did you just sort of say listen to your guidance counselors 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that's a great idea 
 I mean that 
 Right
 It's it seemed expensive at the time you're doing it but but the compared to the the total decision it's nothing
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well back back to this visiting thing 
 I mean I found that my kids had no conception what college was really like and and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand
 and being able to go with them to so- at least some of them gave me a chance to explain things to them and to uh in reference to what we had seen
 Good grief 
 Good grief
 What is twenty-one thousand
 What school is that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Helps to at least set up range of things to look at
