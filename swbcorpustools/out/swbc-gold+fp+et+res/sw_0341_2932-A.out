 Okay 
 I live in Plano in a four bedroom two bath house which is the area's dominantly three bedroom two bath 
 So I'm just a little bit different than typical uh 
 and of course the Plano area is basically with alleyways 
 so everything around here is set up that way Which I think is a little bit different than most areas in the houses the way they're constructed 
 And it's a brick house with uh some wood 
 It's real nice 
 I like it 
 How about you
 Are most of the houses in your area three bedroom two bath
 Yeah 
 to 
 The only thing about mine um I think there's probably about oh when I go down the street I can just pick out houses that are that are identical to mine 
 and usually they are the four bedroom um 
 but they're spaced out oh I'd say maybe three on a two block period 
 Because it's all different builders up here 
 So it's kind of hard at that point to you know classify some of the builders 
 But most of the builders all built three two 
 But the one thing my house is a little bit different 
 and I can pick it out again because it's not typical 
 is I've got the oh what do you call a uh double ceiling double high in one half of the house 
 So like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings
 And uh the kitchen is norm 
 and the bedrooms are norm 
 So it just goes down the dining room the family room and the living room that way 
 And I love the space 
 It just it's uh 
 luckily I came from a house in Colorado which had the cathedral ceiling 
 and I just lucked out and walked into this one 
 and of course I felt the same airy feeling which I liked it real well 
 so it's a nice thing to move into 
 but again it's not typical in this area 
 You can just spot them because the ce- the roof is so hi- much higher 
 But uh 
 Yeah 
 Well it's like when my son goes up into the up into the furnace area over the garage
 He can walk 
 and he's six foot 
 And he says oh come on up mom I'm not going up there 
 I'm not going up there 
 but he says there's plenty of room up there for a room 
 So that means if I knock out the wall in my family room I could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem 
 But um I'm not that ambitious 
 I tol- 
 maybe someday when I feel really ambitious and an- get angry I'll start poking holes up there but until that time 
 But uh I've noticed the houses around here are basically it's one story and they're all basically two uh bath two uh with three bedrooms 
 And we're 
 ninety I would say about oh about ninety-five percent no I guess may- probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick uh with some wood
 But it's it's basically all brick 
 The next subdivision over from me is total brick 
 and the one on the other side of me is about the same as mine 
 But uh the one on opposite the street now they're total brick 
 and they're basically almost all three two 
 They're all three two 
 But of course they have a little river going down their area too which is kind of nice 
 No 
 it's a creek 
 they've put little fountains in and such
 Oh
 Do you have a lot of property I mean a lot of yard around your house now in Denton
 Yeah 
 when you get down closer in to the newer tract homes you find almost like there's no lot line at all 
 They're built practically on top of each other
 I know I was
 Uh-huh 
 Well this subdivision here has got 
 oh there's enough to put oh I'd say uh what twelve feet between each house on each side 
 Well I've got more on one side than I've got on the other 
 but I'm like you 
 I came down from Colorado 
 and there was more land up there around a yard with a big full back yard which here I look out my back yard and I can see the gate 
 I mean the fence is right there 
 I mean just don't run too fast 
 or you'll hit it 
 and I'm not used to that either 
 I mean I could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me 
 but to me you put the swimming pool in your back yard 
 and you've lost your back yard
 I mean uh sure 
 I mean you've got a little place on one side or the other 
 but uh to me their not that big enough for a pool 
 but you know they're going up 
 so But it's uh it's great for mowing 
 But yes 
 I'm used to uh walking out the back yard 
 and you can play catch across the back yard 
 and you've got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball but don't do it around here
 I hadn't thought about it that way
 It ju- 
 well see now with our jobs mainly hitting downtown Dallas we couldn't go too much further 
 but we pra- we went that way 
 It was the schools and the cost of houses 
 so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic time to get into work 
 and that's where we stopped 
 It was the tham- same problem 
 But I think Plano's 
 I got layed off by T I 
 Oh I ye- 
 No 
 I was working at the Dallas site 
 My ex-husband was working downtown
 But I have uh no T I as far as I concerned they've been great as far as layoffs is concerned 
 so I have no problems 
 But as far as the housing I would like personally I would like to move out of a four bedroom house and go with something smaller 
 But prices in Plano there isn't um there isn't a section in Plano you can really move to without getting caught 
 and uh it my price right now for what I pay
