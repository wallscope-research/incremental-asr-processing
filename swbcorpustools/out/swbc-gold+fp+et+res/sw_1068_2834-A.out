 Uh-huh
 Oh uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Around there huh
 Well you're you're just a youngster then 
 I passed the fifty
 So I guess our topic's going to be changes in the women's roles 
 so it should be real interesting
 So you think we're ready
 Okay 
 okay 
 Uh you want to start off
 Uh-huh
 Very much yeah 
 yeah
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 I think all things get started sometimes in that manner
 You know they come in that way
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I hadn't thought much about that 
 but that is true 
 That 
 Uh-huh 
 Some of them
 No 
 No Uh-huh 
 Very much
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Not 
 no 
 they they hurt themselves a little bit in that way
 Uh-huh 
 There you go 
 There's a lot of truth in that
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's right Uh-huh 
 Yes 
 it shouldn't be destroyed
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Well that's kind of makes it exciting You know
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 I think now when both are working they have a more ch- more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way
 Yeah 
 Right 
 Right 
 Yeah
 Because you get set in your ways 
 and it's really hard because to to really to get help Uh d- you know to get the work load shared
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 Our 
 I we have five children 
 they're They're all grown and on their own 
 so 
 They're uh 
 Uh how do you mean that 
 Uh we have uh two girls and three boys 
 and our our baby girl just had a baby girl 
 Last week was her first baby
 So it's been real exciting
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Have you been that way long
 Just eight years
 That's that's a long eight years though
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 That makes a big difference
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yes 
 Well probably your role 
 and and the way you are also has changed though You know compared to what it would have been twenty fifty years ago
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 The best you can yeah
 I 
 yeah 
 that's the only thing I worry about is the the child's love and security 
 That 
 I think that's being damaged uh a lot 
 Uh-huh
 I do too 
 I I think uh 
 now some some women can can do both 
 They're very capable of working 
 and and 
 Uh-huh 
 It it really is yeah
 Uh-huh 
 So many have to work to make a go of it it seems
 or they say they do anyways 
 and but I think ones that don't have to the 
 it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there
 Well that could be
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 You mean it's stronger there
 Much stronger
 Yeah 
 Right 
 Right 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 But they're both 
 Yeah 
 they're both different people too 
 That's That's where the trouble lies
 Some people some people can adjust and have both do both well
 and others can't
 Uh well uh I have one daughter that works full-time 
 She has two little boys
 And they seem to do fine 
 She has been talk- has talked about quitting you know and staying home for a few years 
 But then it's real hard because she's got an excellent job
 Uh
