 All right
 Okay 
 what's your views on it
 Correct 
 Okay 
 well I'm for it 
 I think there are certain crimes that definitely uh call for it 
 I I feel like that child molestation and murder 
 I don't see any sense in someone living that does things like that 
 I I don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way 
 and of course Texas has it but they very seldom you know put it into effect 
 So instead all of our prisons are full of people on you know a lot of people on death row
 Well uh yeah
 which is not very often 
 Right
 What do they do just keep them on death row for the rest of their life 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here
 I know that we have you know 
 really in fact they're they're releasing people uh that are in there for you know not major crimes but uh robberies and assault and things like that 
 and because they don't have room which then they're coming back on the streets and of course doing it again 
 and um you know so we're having problems in in that way 
 and I know that there are some cases that uh you know capital punishment does not fit the crime 
 and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types um but I have to say that I'm honestly for it
 uh almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
 Yes
 I know they use it very um 
 they do not have it in Europe as I understand
 Yes 
 you wonder what their you know how they manage to do that
 Well England has uh don't they have a large fairly large welfare
 Oh I I don't know 
 But we have a lot of welfare programs 
 and 
 if both do and they tend to have less crime you wonder if that has anything to do with it then 
 you know or is it 
 in our society people are brought up over here thinking that you know everybody owes them something
 Oh do you
 Well that's interesting 
 I would not have I would not have said that 
 I would have said that it was more prevalent here in the United States 
 That's an interesting theory 
 I'm not that familiar you know 
 I've only been over there a couple of times 
 and I'm not that familiar with that 
 all I know is that for instance we were in Germany in uh
