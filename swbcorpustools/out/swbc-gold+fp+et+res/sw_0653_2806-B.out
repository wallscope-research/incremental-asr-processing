 I I Well I have uh these 
 well I don't know if they consider themselves animals anymore
 They actually you know sort of take over the place 
 an and we're kind of their pets
 Don't they really 
 They own the place 
 and naturally these are cats 
 so 
 Oh Pogo 
 sure
 Uh-huh
 I agree 
 
 I don't know 
 I I I think that um 
 my husband and I are in such a situation that uh um I'm kind of um not able to do a lot 
 I'm I'm kind of in a wheelchair 
 I mean I kind of am 
 but uh 
 yeah 
 I've got these two cats that hang around with me all day
 and I don't what I'd do without them
 It is 
 and 
 D-

 I forgot to ask you did the iguana catch flies for you

 Yeah 
 
 Oh my goodness these guys they well actually they're my husband's pets
 Well well actually it's like he's the cat person you know 
 and I've I was always kind of nondescript in that category because I always liked dogs
 And they've kind of taken over 
 and and uh you know 
 Maybe it is 
 I 
 they're so independent
 well I'm glad we have two of them otherwise I think they get neurotic if there just one of them
 They get real crazy

 but one is one is uh um 
 they're both registered you know

 He's like a dog

 but they're like seven ye-
