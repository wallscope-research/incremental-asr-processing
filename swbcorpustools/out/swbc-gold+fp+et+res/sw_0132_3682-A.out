 Okay 
 Um well I like to cook um
 but I don't like getting too awfully fancy about it just because um uh it's too much pressure You know 
 if I have people over for dinner I like it to be nice and relaxed
 Yeah 
 And so I don't like to arrive or or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out
 Yeah
 Exactly
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 you'd just do it
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Um Boy I like that
 Yeah 
 well I'm planning a 
 and naturally this is appropriate because I'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night
 So Tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether
 Oh yeah 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's fun
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's a good idea
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's good 
 Well one of my favorites if I don't want to have other people bring stuff I just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice
 It's very easy to
 You don't like it
 Oh you do 
 okay 
 yeah 
 I have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken 
 and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan 
 you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it
 and and you put the chicken in then pour the uh broth over 
 and you can put mushrooms in if you want 
 and then you just 
 Yeah 
 over uncooked rice
 and you can either microwave it 
 or do it in the oven 
 and it just 
 It fluffs up 
 and it's really moist
 Uh-huh 
 wow 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well I'll keep that one in mind
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 you can get away with it even having a semi nice dinner 
 or you know semi 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 You put in um 
 let's see what was it three quarters of cup of rice 
 or 
 It depends on 
 you can really vary it
 But you have to put the water in proportionally 
 I can't remember 
 I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups um broth
 Yeah 
 flavor
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Um let's see 
 I think it was an hour 
 I've done it in the microwave so often lately because it's it's really easy
 Yeah 
 But I think it's about an hour
 Or maybe it's only half hour
 Um you just 
 until the rice looks fluffy and and not overdone You know before it gets overdone
 Yeah
 Um I'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster
 Yeah 
 I liked your idea too there
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
