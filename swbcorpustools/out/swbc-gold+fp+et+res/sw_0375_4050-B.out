 Hello
 That's okay 
 I'm Bill from Raleigh
 Oh another one from a different state besides Texas
 Right
 Uh yes 
 and no 
 it wasn't really a fa- a planning one 
 but it was kind of uh it was a birthday
 and I brought a lot of family together then
 It went pretty good 
 I'm I've worked in hotels 
 so I I kind of know how to do these things
 I used to you know
 Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday 
 and and it's all of like she she comes from a big family 
 She has like seven sisters I think
 They show up and all their kids 
 And then all she has uh 
 I have like uh 
 let's see 
 she has four sons and two daughters 
 and they show up and all their kids 
 so it's a pretty big reunion 
 it's about two hundred people maybe
 Um the probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh
 I guess probably the most helpful thing was that um for the rent we rented like a a rescue squad building or something like that
 And uh each one of the everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for for like soft drinks 
 and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill
 And each person in the family you know brought a dish or something
 It was kind of pot luck
 You know everybody brought their specialties I guess you would say
 Yeah 
 And of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook
 Uh she's eighty-six
 Now she does 
 she looks probably like she's in her early sixties
 and if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact 
 Oh yeah 
 My nickname for her is Honey Woman 
 That's what I call her
 Uh also one thing that's helpful 
 and I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever
 but most of all my family lives like in the same county 
 so 
 But it's just kind of like get on the telephone 
 and it's so and such days from such and such date
 and everybody just shows up
 I would say you're spread out then
 Uh my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever 
 because my dad was in the Army 
 and we're we're pretty strung out all over 
 But since they've moved back to Carolina's we still are the only ones do not live in in Yantsen County
 I live in Raleigh 
 and then my my parents live in Greenville 
 and I have one brother and his wife live in Greenville and uh another brother that lives in outside of Fayetteville 
 So I mean we're we're spread out 
 but everybody else is centralized in in my home town Waynesboro 
 so 
 Nobody moves away except us 
 Yeah 
 I got out as soon as I graduated
 Just like this town is too small for me 
 Good-bye
