 All right Carolyn 
 When do you 
 are you reading the papers about the the Middle East summit
 Yes 
 I'm just a little bit too 
 I think um I think I was worn o- worn out from Middle East after the war
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Wha- 
 That's I think uh 
 I don't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back
 I think that's really uh really important 
 I I I I guess we grew up in such a different world I could never even imagine taking hostages
 But I think they just have a whole different world than we do 
 so I don't know 
 But I don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think um 
 I don't know I have uh I just have this this civil rights mentality I I guess 
 You know should we 
 or or you know sho- should we uh 
 [ those I wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do
 I guess that's what I I hope for them 
 But some of them don't want those freedoms I think 
 Their their religious beliefs may um may not you know 
 they may not want it as a whole 
 so I think that's something that has to be considered too
 But I think that's a that's really a long term type thing 
 I know that the the 
 it said think about long term repercussions 
 and I was just thinking well peace is peace you know 
 and that really is the nicest thing
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 I I think so 
 I think um 
 And 
 Right 
 I think I think they realized we would probably never push him out 
 and uh I think the other 
 probably all of the other Arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yep
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I think the the thing is though I I guess the the Arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any i- ideas that that coincide with the the U S ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the Soviet Union
 And I guess that's all gone 
 I think that's really uh probably what started the whole process
 I 
 Yeah
 I think I think that they're s- they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support from the Soviet Union 
 so I guess they're saying well you know we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries two ways 
 We can either act like we're going to be pro-communist or act like we're going to be pro uh pro-democracy 
 and whatever gets us the most honor that's what we'll act like we're going to do 
 but we really won't change in the long run
 I think that's the way I sort of see them all working you know
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It's it's really funny as an American and always being an ally with the Israelis 
 I always find it very hard in my heart to a- to align with the Israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the Arabs you know
 But then again they have to live in that environment 
 They have to be subjected to all of the Arab bombings and terrorist attacks and whatever
 Then they have to negotiate almost everything 
 and then you think to yourself well you know in your heart you don't want to be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else 
 but if that's the environment that they have to live in and survive in then you have to sort of 
 like I don't know 
 logically
