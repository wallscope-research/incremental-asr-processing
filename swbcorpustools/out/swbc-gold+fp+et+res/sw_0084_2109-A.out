 Yes
 Oh how awful 
 I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction
 Yeah 
 well they keep it rather secretive 
 yes 
 Well the most recent movie I saw uh I'm afraid was uh 
 well two two of them actually 
 Uh the RAIN MAN was one
 Wasn't that fabulous 
 and and DRIVING MISS DAISY
 Oh you need to see that
 That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black 
 and this all took place in the South
 And uh normally never the twain shall meet
 Yes 
 right 
 and um uh it it really was a fantastic movie 
 The acting was phenomenal
 Oh yes 
 Jessica Tandy won best actress 
 and uh 
 Yes 
 it did 
 yes 
 it did
 Just as RAIN MAN uh with Dustin Hoffman uh that that was tremendous and Tom Cruise
 Yes 
 uh oh that was that was uh what the much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman
 Yeah 
 and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati Which is just forty-five miles from from where I am where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton
 Oh we do have Kmart here 
 you better believe it 
 Isn't there a Kmart everywhere
 Yes
 Right 
 right 
 yeah
 Oh yes
 Yes 
 yes
 Well you know there are people uh referred to as savants also uh who can do most phenomenal things 
 and everyone feels they are totally retarded
 That's right
 It's amazing 
 Yes
 Yes 
 and the 
 Right 
 well the warmth that developed between them 
 and again it I think was a picture of relationships
 Again the relationship uh between the two uh that uh never would have occurred uh by accident
 Did you
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 Well that's tremendous 
 that it's good because it does make you think about your own family
 And see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother
 Uh-huh 
 Well he at least saw it one time 
 Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is
 He will do that to research it and to be able to mimic a person uh uh with the kinds of problems that he had
 Yes
 Well I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them
 Well it's just uh been delightful talking with you
 Absolutely 
 I'm ready for it 
 but they're predicting some more snow for our direction
 Take care now 
 Bye bye
