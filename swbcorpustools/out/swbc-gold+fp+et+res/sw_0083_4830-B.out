 No 
 you can start 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 There's there th- this topic is kind of mute Uh 
 there there's no way 
 We we couldn't survive in a sy- in a juror syst- in a trial system without a jury
 Uh one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case
 Uh every person has their opinions 
 and that's why jury selection is often very difficult Uh 
 <> Right
 Right 
 They shouldn't allow an appeal 
 Yep 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh that's right 
 I work for a law firm 
 Right
 Well plea bar- plea bargaining is a different story
 Plea bargaining is something completely different 
 That that actually prevents trials Or at least speeds them up 
 Right 
 Right 
 Huh
 Right
 We do 
 Right
 Right 
 When you're saying as far as the appeal uh procedure was concerned
 We just have the case 
 I'm I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry
 Uh his f- last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up 
 So I mean his appeal was denied 
 and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession
 But uh that was absurd 
 There is never there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence
 Well uh the the only I can I wa- you know 
 the appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of 
 Uh a- like I said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd 
 There's no way that could work 
 Uh but 
 Oh exactly 
 Exactly 
 Right
 No one would want the job 
 Uh and you know like I said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case
 Oh yeah 
 I I feel that everyone is everyone is uh entitled to a trial by jury 
 That that that right s- 
 Well I mean were there witnesses 
 Right
 Right 
 That you can't you can't remove the jury regardless of the case
 I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place 
 and you you'd still there's still mitigating circumstances
