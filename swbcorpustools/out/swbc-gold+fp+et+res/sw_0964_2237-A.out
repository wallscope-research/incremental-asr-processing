 but he really isn't uh real crazy about gardening
 Uh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh

 Oh yeah
 But it's a pleasure to like you said it's good to get outside 
 and and I like I like my garden too 
 We didn't have to we have just a small garden 
 but we planted corn last year too which takes quite a bit of space
 we we didn't have too good luck with it 
 because the uh we had a couple of good real good wind storms 
 and it really damaged the corn
 so we didn't get too much corn last year
 uh uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's great
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 We don't we don't usually cover ours 
 We did a few different times 
 sometimes we've covered with the plastic 
 and other years we've tried newspapers
 and uh but we generally don't we do our watering from our spring
 Yeah
 We have an old fashioned pipe sitting that you know water runs into 
 and my husband set up a pump that runs 
 it runs first down 
 and then it stops
 and when the water comes up it comes on again 
 and we use that to water our garden with 
 so 
 Oh I do 
 I do
 I love it
 I'd rather be doing that than housework 
 Uh not a who- well not a whole lot 
 I think our cabbages and broccolis and that <> we have more trouble with that type of thing with the the 
 Yeah
 Uh
 Uh-huh 
 Do you go more for natural keeping them off naturally 
 or do you use insecticides
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well our lawn is is a big lawn because because we live out in the country 
 and so we were not our lawn is not perfect you know 
 it's just the it's just a lawn 
 Uh-huh
 Do you eat any of them
 Oh did well did does your wife ever make uh bake in a hot bacon dressing like for salad
 Oh it's delicious 
 and it goes real good on dandelions
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 use the greens if you get them when they're young and tender you know before they have grown too too tall 
 because they do get a little stringy
 But uh they're kind of fun to to try
 get a get a few 
 and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Uh but I've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back 
 and he's been having trouble with 
 so wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower
 so it takes about four hours to cut our grass
 And we have we have hills 
 I'm afraid of the hills 
 but I'm getting on to it 
 I just pretend they're not there 
 and I just go ahead and do it
