 Well actually I love the car I have 
 I have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible 
 And I love it 
 And I would get another one in a minute 
 Unless I could afford what I really like which would be a red Ferrari or you know a little Corvette or something like that 
 And that's what would influence my decision to change because I like a really sporty car 
 And I'd love an expensive one 
 but I probably can never afford it 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Well I'm a nurse here 
 and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari
 And I couldn't tell you 
 but it's just beautiful 
 And I go out and I love to touch it 
 but I can't even do that because of the alarm 
 So I just look at it a lot 
 Really 
 Exactly 
 But it sure is a pretty thing 
 No 
 I'm working on it 
 No 
 I really haven't 
 no 
 huh-uh 
 I did test drive a Corvette last year Maybe the year before 
 It was brand new white 
 it was like a big marshmallow 
 When you sat in the seats they adjusted to fit around you
 I mean they came in and up and out 
 and I mean they did whatever 
 and and we went for a test drive in that 
 and I was able to open that up pretty good 
 and that was really fun 
 And I wanted it 
 but I had a choice of that or my house 
 and I thought that I'd continue to live in my house 
 so 
 Yeah 
 you know it's just necessary 
 And I did I thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical
 Yeah 
 right 
 So 
 They are they're pretty aren't they lately 
 They really are
 Really
 Oh no 
 No 
 no 
 See I'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now 
 and they go isn't that a nice van 
 and I go um
 Not really you know 
 How about a Greyhound bus 
 Yeah 
 I mean that you know 
 There's some that are prettier than others 
 and 
 yeah 
 the new type is prettier than what their they used to look like 
 but I sure don't think it's attractive you know 
 It's not like like driving a little sports car
 Yeah 
 I don't think that happens 
 so but I I love mine 
 so and I I bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii 
 and I just went home 
 and I walked in 
 and I picked it out 
 and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to 
 and I never did 
 I just went back and signed the papers 
 and I knew nothing about my car when I got it 
 Nothing 
 I didn't know how anything worked
 Yeah 
 And I've had it 
 it's almost three years actually 
 And I've I still love it 
 I put the top down everywhere I go 
 I timed it when I first got it 
 and it took twenty min- I mean twenty seconds 
 and so I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds
 So 
 Twenty seconds 
 yeah 
 That's all it takes 
 I mean it's just a button that's it 
 You release it right at the top 
 so you don't have to get out or anything
 Well I did actually 
 Last week going to the airport 
 I just hit a downpour 
 and I was on a highway going like eighty
 So I really did 
 I mean I was soaking wet 
 I thought I would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over 
 But it all dried out you know Didn't take long when the sun came out 
 but it was kind of funny 
 I'm sure people around me really enjoyed it 
 but 
 Oh 
 {F and } wasn't it pretty last week with the Bluebonnets and everything 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 <> Yeah 
 A lot of people say that 
 and it's pretty far from where I live
