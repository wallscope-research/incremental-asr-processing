 A Ford Explorer
 A Ford Explorer
 Yeah 
 one of the new ones
 And um I'd I'd probably buy another this is the first American vehicle I've owned
 So I would probably purchase another one um I would be more selective in the dealership that I purchased it from 
 but as far as uh the quality seems to be there um it's quiet it's it handles well um 
 but I believe I'd get that or a Porsche one of the two
 No 
 not 
 And why would that be
 What's wrong with the Volvo
 Oh
 What what city are you calling from
 Oh
 Up in Dallas
 Um
 B M W or Mercedes yeah 
 well that's a that's a 
 Uh-huh
 What do you presently drive
 Um fun
 Well there nothing wrong with those uh They're they're nice veh- they're nice vehicles nothing wrong with those 
 It um it's just everybody has their own taste 
 but man the Mercedes are expensive 
 My wife has a Volvo 
 and it it's nice I mean you know it's okay an 
 Huh
 Oh no 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 it 
 it 
 I I kind of wish we would have maybe gone for the G L rather than the D L 
 but because they- it is the safest car on the road uh *[[ slash error ]] Oh yeah
 *[[ slash error ]] Yeah 
 there just safe to just 
 that's the reason why we mainly got it 
 We got white 
 and it's the safest four door you know it's good for if you have a family which we do
 We just we just 
 one out 
 and so it's it's uh um you know 
 they're kind of low to the ground after driving the Explorer 
 You know I presently 
 I used to have a two eighty Z 
 and I'm a tall guy an 
 and uh they're hard to get around in traffic to see
 Because you can't see a car ahead of you 
 but they're fast as lightning and all that crap 
 But the Explorer I mean you're sitting up on top of everything 
 and you can really see real well 
 And I just 
 it's so comfortable 
 and and uh *[[ I'd call this an incomplete slash unit ]] So you're 
 what are your feelings about American versus European cars
 Why not
 That's the way it goes I guess
 Yeah 
 I was real hesitant 
 but it was 
 I don't know uh I mean I think European cars are great course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff 
 and they're eas- 
 some some of them are easy to work on 
 A Volvo being a four cylinder is very easy to work on
 Uh excellent warranty I mean just unbelievable warranty 
 And and uh of course Ford isn't too bad 
 I think Chrysler would probably make a good vehicle 
 uh but all of it has to do in my opinion with the service and the attitude of the service of the dealership
 I wouldn't send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford
 There's 
 Middlekauff Ford in Plano
 Their just 
 their attitude is just slimy 
 And and uh I've written a a letter to Middlekauff 
 and I've told them that matter of fact I got another letter last night from the Quality Ford Division their still concerned about my attitude 
 *[[spelling "their" should be "they're]] and it it will never change about that place
 And uh 
 but uh anyway that's my own personal comment I guess 
 but 
 Middlekauff wouldn't 
 She needs to find herself a lawyer 
 She'd she'd come out like a champ on that one
 So ha- have you been using well anyway 
 That was 
 I was asking you some questions about the telephone and how long and how many have you been doing 
 but that's 
 they they don't want to hear that
 Is that all 
 A week
 Good Lord 
 I think I started in January or February
 Oh God I've 
 I'm like twenty some phone calls
 That's why I I wasn't sure if this was the second time around or what 
 Well look I've enjoyed speaking with you
 And keep smiling
 Bye bye
