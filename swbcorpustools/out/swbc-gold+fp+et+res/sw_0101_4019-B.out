 Yeah I do 
 I've got a male Siamese about a year old here 
 I live alone in an apartment and uh except for the cat
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 Well it's uh you know they're just uh aggressive by nature
 and uh he's been neutered and declawed 
 so he's an indoor cat 
 so uh that kind of calms him down for the most part
 How about yours
 Huh
 And and you say you've had him how long
 Two years
 Huh
 Does he bite her enough to draw blood
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 boy 
 I guess 
 Well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive I guess with the daughter he's all right
 You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Is that the only pet that you have
 Well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh 
 I see
 Sure 
 No 
 no 
 I I live alone in an apartment 
 and uh it's it's not that big that uh 
 although I've heard rabbits are pretty good
 you know I saw something on C N N or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and in houses 
 and they apparently uh 
 especially when they're young when they bring them in 
 uh 
 I guess
 I guess 
 yeah 
 and I would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either
 Yep 
 that's right
 Did you see the the C N N the the dog show uh
 I see 
 Well they have uh uh a Wesmin- they call it the Westminster Dog Show uh 
 I think it's in New York City at the at the Gardens 
 there once a year live 
 and they had that on last week 
 and that's really kind of something to watch uh 
 it's on I think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two
 and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there 
 Some of them are really beautiful too
 So 
 So you live in Utah do you
 Goodness 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well do you all work for T I or for 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 This is the very first one I've I've talked to
 Uh-huh
