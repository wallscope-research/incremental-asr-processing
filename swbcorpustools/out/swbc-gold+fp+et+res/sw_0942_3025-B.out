 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 those are things I like the most 
 I like fish and chicken the most
 And uh most of the cooking I do just comes out of a can
 Unless it is unless it is I catch a fish and I prepare it 
 And then I just uh you know I just broil it and put lemon on it
 Uh-huh
 Sesame seeds and bread crumbs
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 uh-huh
 Oh there's a restaurant called String Bean on Spring Valley and Central
 I like that 
 it's just it's just home cooking
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 exactly 
 uh-huh 
 and that's that's the other restaurant Black Eye Pea
 So I do not really like uh you know uh uh chili places or what is it Judge Roy Bean's 
 or I do not like greasy places
 Yeah
 Right 
 and I and I got uh chicken marinara the last two times
 It was uh it was great
 Because that's that's what I like 
 I do not like it you know I just like a baked you know a piece of chicken 
 and then I get like green beans and mashed potatoes
 You know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 My uh my brother tried to make uh a bunch of things uh way back 
 He tried to make bagels one time
 Yeah 
 and uh we took some 
 and then we had uh German Shepherds at the time 
 and we took some and gave it to the dogs 
 and the dog never you know he treated it like a milk bone 
 and he never did finish it
 He just barely made a dent in it
 Uh and uh then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time
 It's uh supposed to be candy
 And uh it it did not turn out very well 
 it was you know It like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into uh into a kind of a candy stick 
 so uh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Well you have to put eggs and everything don't you 
 Or 
 Yeah 
 just about
 Uh-huh 
 Use about half the sugar 
 or make everything diet
 Mostly I just cook for myself
 Uh-huh
 It's easy 
 that's for sure
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I always put cheese on them
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 but you know there's hardly any I guess there's hardly any protein 
 it's mostly starch 
 So it fills you up 
 and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get
 Oh yeah 
 it really is
 Then you have to make a salad 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Except you get to taste the product instead 
 Fill them up 
 or blow up
 Yeah 
 
 Oh yeah 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Did you let the can cool off
 Yeah
 Huh Yeah
 Right
