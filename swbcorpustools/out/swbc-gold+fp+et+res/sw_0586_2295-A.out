 All right 
 Well on this subject I really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet 
 but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home
 so I've always been involved you know in one
 Well I've Well I can kind of see both sides you know 
 I really can 
 Uh nursing homes to me 
 I would personally be the last resort you know I rea- you know if I had to put someone in there
 Yeah 
 if it's a have to thing 
 yeah 
 I 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well I kind of think that's true too I guess because it's so under staffed you know
 *[[slash error; two utts]] that's like everything else though
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 but 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I know 
 I've always 
 well my sister's involved in one also 
 and I really think they really do a wonderful job 
 But still there's those little things that happens you know
 there really is which 
 I think it's a wonderful place you know if it comes to that you know if you just can't take care of them any more
 Uh-huh 
 that's it
 Uh-huh
 Other things
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah
 but I think when the time comes I I hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that I really think my mother would be happy at
 I do too
 Outside's awful deceiving sometimes you know
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Ca- 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Off 
 yeah
 To 
 no
 Uh-huh 
 and everything you worked so hard for all your life
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Now there is some really nice ones 
 There's also you know some private ones you know
 but of course I would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that you know
 that's way out of my reach
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 the very same 
 yeah
 No 
 but [ I there's I think there's ] ways around it though that you know 
 like they could put it in one of their children's names or something you know 
 But still a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that 
 You know it's their money
 You know that's how I feel about it anyway
 Yes
 Yeah 
 my mother's seventy now 
 so naturally she's retired 
 but she's still on her own I mean
 I think that's wonderful 
 I really do 
 just as long as they can 
 and then on the other hand I've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know
 Uh-huh 
 they're not lonely
 Oh yes 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 No
 Around 
 yeah
 But I really don't know what the other solution would be you know 
 I really don't 
 But no 
 when the time comes I'm really hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents
 really do 
 because I have been raised in one you know 
 so there's lot of things I know to look for
 And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work either you know 
 I really don't
 It really would 
 yes 
 yes 
 and like I said my sister's still in it 
 and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there either
 Oh 
 Well it's been nice talking to you
 And I guess we'd better get back to work huh
 All right 
 Bye-bye
