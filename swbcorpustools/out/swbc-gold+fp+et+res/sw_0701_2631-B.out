 Uh-huh 
 Well that's good
 Uh-huh 
 Yes 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I um 
 that that's 
 oh oh you mean you switched schools for the kids
 Uh-huh
 We- 
 well I'm just recently married
 So I don't have any children Though we plan on having them soon 
 but I think um that I that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties uh 
 I think um I'm lucky though that um my wife will probably not have to work while our children are under four or five 
 Yeah 
 I'm a college professor
 so 
 and that's also 
 and it's nice for me because um most of the time you have so so much flexible hours so that I could probably work two or three days a week and then one or two evenings so that if my wife does um does go back to work part time um there probably will be a possibility that I could stay home two days that she would go to work and that I would have to teach at night
 Yeah 
 so it will probably workout real nice for us uh
 I think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules
 I can even teach on Saturdays and and things like that 
 Yeah 
 um I do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding uh child care
 and one of the things they made in um uh 
 real 
 they're number one priority was that um they're children didn't have to leave their home 
 *[[transcript error--spelling of initial "they're" should be "their"]] So they um um 
 my sister-in-law is a uh um a clinical speech pathologist
 so she is als- 
 I guess her most recent position after she returned back to work she applied for a director's position an- and got it 
 So I guess she's very well qualified for her field I guess 
 and even though she took off two years for um 
 I guess four years all together 
 it would be three years 
 how old's Kayla 
 three yeah 
 I guess she took off three years all together um for cause I guess they have a four year old 
 and yeah and my nephew is two almost two
 so I guess she took off three all together 
 and then when she decided to go back to work um she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home
 Yeah 
 I think they were really lucky there 
 but I think they've lost this woman she wi- she will not continue
 And and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school
 So I don't know what they are going to do
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I think I think they they're both they were both professionals unlike me they're um they were married my brother's five years younger then she is
 so she was probably twenty-seven when they were married
 so she already had had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a profes- in a practice almost Um where you know he then they waited a couple years 
 and and he got himself pretty far along I guess they didn't have kids until he was about twenty sev- twenty-six 
 so by that time she was so well established you know I guess it made it a lot easier
 but uh I think the longer you wait the easier the easier it is if you have that that professional occupation where you can change
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 That's right 
 that's true yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yep 
 Yeah 
 definitely *[[slash error]] Were safe 
 *[[slash error]] Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that 
 yeah 
 that's you know that's so important I um I I guess it's so funny now with schools you know they don't take kid into kindergarten and when I guess when they're five 
 and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now
 They don't let them into kindergarten unless they can count to ten and know their A B Cs 
 and I think that's so funny because um I don't I don't know if I want 
 school's very important I'm an educator myself and my wife teaches
 *[[ Seems to be 2 slash units ]] and I 
 it's a very important part of your life 
 and I hope to read with my kids 
 but I don't know if I want my kids to go to school At four or three
 you know I can see tha- that when you make that point
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yep 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 that's a really important point
 Yep 
 I think that's really that's important 
 I I've seen the same thing 
 I I think you're exactly right because you know I've gone ou- 
 or 
 before I was married I went out with a girl 
 and you know um boy after you know after about two months I realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems
 And I bet 
 and they could be traced back to just not being uh you know being moved between day care centers when she was one and two and three years old and never always being a bit snippy and spiteful 
 I bet you could trace all the way back 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 That's true 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yep 
 that's true 
 Yeah 
 that's really true
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I I think I'm I'm very lucky
 Um because of having you know flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule
 Especial- 
 I teach a computer classes 
 so it's it's one of things where I'm paid a little bit better then a History or an English professor 
 and I'm also um you know 
 they have vocational type courses on weekends almost everywhere
 and you know you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday which means that you know whole week's worth of courses 
 so that lets you be available three days during the week you know 
 so you be will home with your kids I you know 
 it's really funny is that I I picked this career when I was in college because uh I think with my commitment to family and um wanting to spend more time with my children because my dad had very um nine to five type job with uh forty-five minute commute into the city and a forty-five commute home 
 so by the time he got home he was so tired 
 and he was all rung out from the day
 and I think he he missed a lot of um our up bringing
 You know my mother 
 I I came from a family tha- that my mother stayed home until we started school
 Um and I I don't uh 
 it's funny I don't think she had to work until we started school I think teenagers become much more expensive 
 *[[ 2 slash units ]] It's probably costing you a fortune
 My goodness if if you want them to be able to drive the car the insurance bill 
 Th- um 
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Carpools uh 
 Yeah 
 my parents did a lot of that
 That's right 
 Yep 
 And just to save you trips to and from you know uh ball games and athletic events and activities at the school
 Yeah 
 isn't that something how you know you think about child care 
 and it lasts along time
 *[[along> a long]] It it lasts a long time
 Well normally they come in uh *[[slash error]] Oh oh cause they'll come in in ten minutes normally and stop us
 *[[slash error]] Well you don't have to 
 but they they 
 um you go the length 
 and sometimes if it's a very busy time period you'll go about seven minutes
 Depends on how old the tapes are at that time
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 This is Baltimore Maryland
 Yeah 
 well most of most of the people I talk to are from Texas
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 and I've discussed I've discussed um
