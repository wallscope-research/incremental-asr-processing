 Uh yeah 
 I I think so 
 I I'm uh I think I'm I think I'm uh a little out of the ordinary in that that I I uh I think I'm more worried about the deficit the national deficit than than uh a lot of other people are and think that we need to we need to either raise our taxes or or cutback on something 
 and I don't know what to cutback on to to get to get that to get that settled 
 And and uh and uh I know I'm a real a real uh out of it in terms of taxes 
 so I'm no- I'm uh think that the we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that uh for Texas 
 and and 
 Yeah 
 I think so 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 now I'm uh uh oh I 
 we'd when we moved to R- Richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the uh for the schools And and realizing that that that that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to uh to go for that because we supported the 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I think that's right
 Yeah
 I I don't I don't know about that 
 I I 
 I see 
 Okay 
 No uh 
 Yeah 
 well that that that would be true 
 That would be true 
 But 
 Huh
 Yeah 
 and and even if it is isn't going to uh uh provide you with any any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your your home to a business for instance you know
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 And 
 Yeah 
 and the other thing is that when it when it's the public transportation is established that early on then then the business uh business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that
 Whereas in in uh in Dallas here we've we've got uh those patterns were well established before before we really tried to tried to do the DART 
 And uh for instance all the all the the uh office buildings and stuff that are out here in in uh north Dallas as opposed to downtown 
 uh to try to to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the the metroplex to to uh both those centers of of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area You know like New York does 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Right 
 right
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 right
 Yep
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 A little bit much 
 Oh yeah 
 Yep 
 Yep 
 Oh the c- 
 Yeah 
 I th- I think so 
 I think that will probably do it 
 so 
 Good enough
 Bye
