 Well I love to cook as a matter of fact I'm making dinner right now 
 Um I um I'm making some uh 
 I have a little turkey left from a passover whi- whi- which was in April
 And I had frozen it 
 and I'm defrosting that and making some dressing and gravy and making corn and wheat stuff that you can buy at a store which is like uh rice pilaf
 but we 
 with with with wheat kernel that 
 No 
 um I'm married 
 and actually the 
 my wife is a vegetarian
 so this isn't for her 
 this is for our friends that came over and helped helped me do some stuff 
 so 
 stuff so 
 he and I 
 and and she's having 
 I I do cook um virtually 
 I cook most of the time because I 
 Yeah 
 we we consistently 
 if we cook 
 if if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier
 So we'll make something you know uh some sort of pasta or something you know homemade pasta or lasagna or something
 Oh good idea
 What 
 Um 
 Electric or uh 
 Best kind 
 That that that that's 
 we we bought one in Italy
 That's the best kind to have
 Uh-huh
 that's real good
 Um 
 That would be great 
 Have you made pasta before
 Um so you know so you know that it's a a lot of fun actually
 I 
 It actually is if if if you have a food processor 
 I don't know if you have a food processor or not 
 Actually it it turns out that i- i- if if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply
 And then um and with that it becomes really easy to make colorful pasta By throwing in some spinach or some tomato or something and mixing it up 
 it it's a snap from there 
 And then I made 
 I making yucky 
 It's also 
 people think it's real hard 
 it just time consuming to get all of the little things right
 Otherwise it's real 
 it's good stuff 
 What other kinds of uh dinner parties do you serve
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 you didn't want to cook
 That's great
 Uh Yeah 
 that's how these things sort of make it for one person as an experiment 
 and I usually find it when I make up for the first time I usually doctor it just a little bit and little here and there
 and it works real well
 That means you're a real cook
 If you've ever watched the ones on television like uh Jeff Schmidt the super gourmet He he just thro- takes stuff he says yeah about an ounce of this or something 
 It's real good
 Yeah 
 we have a we do uh uh middle eastern dinner quite a bit actually
 or uh we have people other that have never experienced it before and haven't had much middle eastern food
 *[[other = over]] We make uh cause we're my wife is Syrian 
 And um her families always have this food she grew up in 
 and I've made some of it before as well
 so we make uh four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple
 We put them out for people 
 an- and that's always a real big kick for people who want you know who've never tried it before
 That's that's that's that's a fun idea I mean if you ever uh want something different to try
 I would try that
 Oh do you have a wok though
 Yeah 
 I think it's God's gift to cooking Cause it's just quick
 it's easy um 
 and the food just comes out 
 you know if you do it right I think it comes out the food comes out very tasty not very mushy
 you know and and it doesn't taste like a million calories of oil 
 so We li- live in our wok
 Yeah 
 we we we like to eat even when we eat out and stuff we eat a lot of Chinese food or Japanese food or you know Korean 
 and that seems to 
 so wok food seems to be our thing
 So anything else you cook 
 Well that's good 
 that's always the way to do it 
 I think it's uh 
 Oh the Wilson course
 I like it 
 That's great 
 I haven't the Wilson class 
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 oh yeah 
 we have um 
 my brother can do it
 he's he's uh got a degree in business management 
 so he learned to uh how to do this 
 Can you hold on one second
 Thank you 
 Sorry about that
 Some one kept beeping in our calling waiting 
 so 
 Yeah 
 he he do- does that a lot
 so you know he cooks a lot 
 but you know he bakes a lot whenever he 
 whe- when my wife and I got married the night before we had a party Or two nights before 
 and he baked us he made a real big cake himself
 so New Years our friend made a baby Cake like a baby New York
 It was amazing 
 I never could do anything with cakes 
 so I get the mold I put I put it on you know the frosting always melts 
 and it's it's just horrible
 Yeah 
 I'm 
 Oh that that you mean about the mix itself 
 Well that helps
 Yeah
 Well most frostings are sort of butter cream to aren't they
 *[[ to = too ]] Those are those kill me 
 it's like it's like I'm eating sugar 
 but they're good sugar
 I think that's part of the problem 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I guess so
 It was it was a pleasure chatting with you 
 Yes 
 well have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week
 Bye-bye
