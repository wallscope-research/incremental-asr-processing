 Weather-wise or otherwise
 Weather-wise 
 Damp cold warm 
 We have we have gone through what might be called the four seasons uh in the last week
 We have had highs of seventy-two lows in the twenties
 I heard about that
 Um 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 The blue flu
 yeah 
 the blue flu or the white collar flu depending on where you work I guess
 Oh we have had uh as I've said we have had variable weather Uh
 It has been untypically wet for this time of year
 and also we have a lot of green you know 
 the grass has been growing 
 and if you look outside you would like to go out and mow your lawn if you could go out and buy a new spark plug or something along those lines 
 but fortunately it rains 
 and you uh do not have to go out and buy the spark plug you know 
 But we've had an unusually uh uh warm spring 
 and well I guess we're still in winter 
 and uh we have had no snow
 To speak of to speak of 
 We usually average oh anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter 
 and this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation
 So it's been inordinately warm uh here for uh for this time of year
 So uh in that regard it's fine 
 but uh I envy you your ninety-four degrees
 I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well I spent six years in graduate school at in Indiana In the flatlands 
 and it was that way every day
 Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour Summer and winter 
 so that uh 
 you you became accustomed to it I guess
 But uh otherwise w- as I said we have had uh a relatively mild winter speaking for this area of the country
 Purdue
 Oh yes
 Well you are not from that area originally I can tell
 Oh okay
 Uh-huh
 Well I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere
 Uh-huh
 Gee 
 you've moved almost moved around as much as I have 
 Oh I see
 Well I worked for the government 
 so I I moved uh much more frequently than I had intended for sixteen years
 but uh I guess the uh this is my first conversation in this uh uh series
 I I received a call last night because of the uh 
 I had not received my uh personal identification number
 So I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was because I I had to abort the call last evening because I couldn't get on the line
 So uh is there any 
 I'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk
 Oh O-
 No 
 I do not 
 I work for G T E
 And I uh of course was I was sent a uh an application from uh from Jack
 I've known Jack for some time 
 I'm in the speech processing business and have been for a number of years 
 so I was very much interested in in being a speaker for this 
 Oh I see
 Uh-huh
 I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative 
 and um but I have uh I have been a speaker in other uh similar type of activities
 And I know the reason why this is why the uh this is being gathered and the program and so forth 
 so I was interested as I said I was interested in being a speaker
 We haven't talked much about the weather 
 I know that's what we're supposed to do
 Uh-huh 
 In environmental engineering uh 
 is that with regard to work place engineering or just you know environm- the work place environment 
 or 
 Oh I see
 Uh-huh
 Well I had 
 my the the call last evening was supposed to be about uh concerning recycling in the community 
 The call I received 
 and so I had uh I had thought a little bit about it um before hand
 So I 
 but that that's interesting 
 I have a uh uh friend who is a planner Uh a city planner 
 And one of his 
 and he models uh city districts and so forth uh does computer modeling
 And one of the uh 
 he has inputs or gets inputs from uh an environmental engineer 
 Uh-huh
 Oh I see
 Well that's interesting
