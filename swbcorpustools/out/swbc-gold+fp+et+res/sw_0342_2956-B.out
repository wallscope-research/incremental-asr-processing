 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh <>
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 What 
 Right 
 Right 
 Oh really 
 they hold it on the weekends
 Sunday 
 Uh-huh 
 Huh
 Well uh 
 I I know here in Dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years a uh a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections 
 And they I do not think they have seen a really high improvement 
 No 
 No 
 I always vote 
 Oh really 
 Huh 
 To absentee vote specifically
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh <>
 But I do not think it is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place who or who are not just motivated who really believe that their they their voice is heard 
 I mean and the people that I have talked to 
 Right 
 I think that is the biggest one 
 That's the biggest problem 
 I 
 Uh-huh
 Oh really 
 Huh <>
 I don't understand that 
 Why do uh is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public And the public's uh gullibility 
 Well he did refute it 
 He he refuted it 
 it just was not effective enough to 
 Well that see I I didn't believe anybody would believe that either 
 I I I guess I have a hard time coming to terms with the the fact that the American public really was you know so 
 Well then how can a democracy work then
 How how can it work 
 Right 
 Right
 What 
 Huh 
 Well how about how about the reverse of that 
 When I have heard about England's elections they are allowed to run for what a total of six or eight weeks Even for the higher offices in the in the land 
 What if we totally took money out of the camp- eh ma- just severely limited the campaigns so money wasn't so much of an issue 
 I feel like if if we did that people would have a lot higher confidence that their vote was counting rather than their contributions would count 
 I don't I don't care how easy it is for them 
 I do not think they are going to because they do no think that their that anybody listens to their vote 
 They think whoever has the b- 
 They really think that the packs you know no matter what you're promised during a campaign 
 and these days we are promised hardly anything of substance 
 Right 
 And eh and eh y- no matter what a a candidate promises during the campaign i- which isn't very much specif- 
 any th- they do not promise anything specific these days 
 But whatever you are promised they just they just reverse themselves depending on who pays them what once they get into office 
 I mean I think that's the 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well then why did he say that during his campaign
 Then he 
 it was totally irr- 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well 
 What about what about voters in the other countries that you were talking about 
 Like in the European countries where they have higher turnouts And well the newer democracies 
 because it's going to be totally different 
 but 
 You do not think so 
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 Right 
 Oh really 
 Yeah 
 Huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh I see 
 because right 
 Weren't qual- 
 dis- were disqualified 
 But isn't that isn't that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the blacks and Hispanics and other minorities just don't vote 
 Or is that just the the truth 
 Yeah 
 Well Right 
 right 
 But you know that just made me think of something that happened down here in Dallas last year 
 They have this huge fight going over redistricting here
 And at one point they di- they took another vote on it 
 and they uh the minorities could not get enough of a vote out to to pass their plan 
 And this is something that had been going on for months 
 It was on the news every night 
 They and they have had lawsuits over it 
 I mean it was r- it was a major issue 
 and there still wasn't enough minority vote to get to pass the plan that they were backing 
 So that's y- 
 you know I think that you have really hit on something there 
 Wa- to say that uh those 
 Well with the minorities and we are saying we have lower voter turnout 
 Maybe it is is uh now that we have minorities included in the 
 Why 
 did you not press one
