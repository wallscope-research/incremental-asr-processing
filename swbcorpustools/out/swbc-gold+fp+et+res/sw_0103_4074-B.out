 Oh we have one rotten cat
 Yeah 
 it's my son's cat
 Yeah 
 that's the boys 
 They know I don't like it
 Well I like cats 
 This this cat is a uh more like a dog
 Yeah 
 he's uh a one owner 
 He likes one boy in the family and that's about it 
 Just uh stays away or runs usually 
 But he follows he'll follow my oldest son around 
 You know when he is in the house he will come up and he'll jump on his lap 
 but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing
 He's he we bought the cat for him 
 and so he's uh been the one that you know spent the most time with him
 But I I've never owned a cat like that 
 I've had cats growing up all the time 
 and you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody 
 So it's a weird cat 
 A mutt
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 So that is that is that kind of your child right now
 You feel like 
 Oh uh-huh
 Have have you had dogs before
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well I just uh we've you know 
 when I was growing up I had we always had a dog 
 and we had mostly mutts 
 well not mutts but mixes you know like one or two mix 
 and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 No 
 No 
 it's just uh an accident 
 From a frie- uh from my my son's friend down the street 
 They're they're cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens 
 and so 
 Uh we I would 
 We uh we had a dog that was a uh mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador
 and uh I should say a pup 
 and he was just too big for our kids when we got him 
 and we when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet 
 and it was a dog that we gotten 
 and he was he was just too big
 Uh the kids couldn't handle him 
 and I was still going to school 
 and my wife was working 
 and I was working 
 and so we just didn't have time to really train him 
 so he was kind of jus- you know he was too big for the kids to handle 
 so he was just tied up to a post
 so we gave him to uh 
 I don't know if you've 
 there is a place out here uh called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville
 and they have uh 
 I guess it's kind of an animal shelter 
 but he just takes a few the animals in 
 and some he destroys 
 and some he keeps
 So we took him up there 
 and he ended up keeping him 
 Uh cause he has had him for six or seven years 
 We we've saw him just about a year ago 
 and uh I thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away
 and so we asked him about it one day 
 and he said yeah 
 he's been the best dog I've ever had in my life
 just goes everywhere with him 
 I he would have been a great great dog
