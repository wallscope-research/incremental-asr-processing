 Yes 
 I saw HOME ALONE with some friends just a couple days ago 
 I wanted to see it uh because there was uh much recommended for months and months and months 
 and it was a a genre that I wasn't in the least bit interested in 
 and I usually when I hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good even if it's in a genre I don't like 
 I figure well I should go see it because if this is you know the best of the genre and I should know about it or something like that
 and I usually come away thinking no I really don't like this show 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well the the problem I had with the movie was the problem I've had with a lot of uh I guess Hollywood movies which is [ they are + it's a formula movie 
 and they're ] making the movie according to certain formula that's a good formula
 but they seem to fall short of of being really creative with a lot of things 
 I mean here's the situation of this kid at home you know 
 it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in
 and you know he did some clever things 
 but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was it seems to me they could have done a lot more I mean you know basically stepping on things and yelling in pain
 and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well I guess it was a uh a very successful movie financially 
 so we may see more slapstick
 Yeah 
 it is it is 
 and I guess you don't have to but you know if you look at oh 
 have you ever seen any of the movies
 The French movies that 
 Um
 No 
 I'm not with you so far
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 They have they have a 
 Yes they like your Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated Am- of sophisticated American everywhere
 But they have this one guy who does slapstick comedy 
 and there's something about it that's so innovative you know 
 he'll have trouble picking up his hat or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind or something 
 but there's something about it that just it isn't just slapstick 
 there's something about the human character in it
 and that's what I find lacking in a lot of you know like HOME ALONE 
 There was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying 
 and there was a lot of human character there 
 but when it was the real slapstick moments him versus the criminals kind of thing it just sort of lost the human element and became purely a caricature
 does that make since to you
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Did you go with kids though 
 Did you go with kids
 Did you take kids along
 Oh I would have liked to have a kid with me I think preferably someone seven or eight just just to get a sense for you know how how it affected them especially to come home 
 and you know I would have gotten in trouble the next day 
 I'm sure
 Oh TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES
 Uh-huh
 And your cousin's a kid
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 isn't it amazing
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it was all bloodless
 and the good guys can get hit all day long
 and they have to shake it off
 they don't they don't you know get uh epileptics that sort of thing from getting hit on their head
 you know it's a little disturbing the violence in these films 
 partly it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book on the other hand it makes it seem like 
 I read an article one time talking about even the quote unquote realistic movies don't have very realistic upsets of the violence 
 The violence can seem very realistic 
 but the aftermath is usually not there
 So you see people who are severely injured very very badly lose control of body functions
 they thrash around 
 they scream you know uh 
 it's just a very very bad thing 
 and they never present that 
 even the movies that want to show violence as real they don't really show you what happens with that real violence
 and I'm not really sure how I feel about that
 Uh on the one hand I'd like it to be a warning 
 on the other hand I wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee now we want to see the aftermath all the time either
 But 
 yeah 
 TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES was sort of the same way 
 they I guess they figured I mean they know what they're doing 
 and they make the movies good enough I guess I'm a bit of a snob they make the movies good enough to be successful
 and then they don't and they but they could make them better you know
 they could try to make 
 I mean as far as I was concerned TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES could have been a classic of world theater
 it could have been you know 
 it was it was innovative uh a completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways 
 and yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable because the the story was stupid and and then things like that 
 and they built up 
 I remember feeling annoyed again I didn't have a kid with me and I remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the Master and the passing of wisdom the from older to younger generation 
 it was it was a classic Greek you know you know a sort of European mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with
 um and he had to 
 and he told them remember remember you were united you can succeed individually you will fail
 and then there was a big climactic fight scene 
 and they didn't remember that
 they didn't fight together 
 they fought individually 
 and they failed individually 
 and then that was it 
 then they had to have the Master beat him
 and the Master should according to the classic myth the sort of Joseph Campbell type myth he the Master should have died at the end because the the lesson was passed to the young generation 
 and the older generation is not needed 
 and is reborn to the younger generation 
 and on and on and on and all this wonderful mess
 and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they had included all this stuff that I anyway as an intellectual adult would appreciate 
 it wouldn't have hurt the movie to do that 
 and it would have make it uh broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for I thought
 but I uh I'm truly enough you know I'm truly an intellectual snob to be going to these kinds of movies 
 I realize that I mean to go to these movies and expect them to be you know other than just just good entertainment kind of thing
 Yeah 
 yeah
 I I I I'm very I'm very critical 
 I I I'm actually originally from Hollywood 
 and then then then 
 and my father works in films 
 and such 
 and I tend to tend to be hypercritical of these things 
 and then perhaps perhaps it's unfair because I I I must admit I enjoy these movies
 and that's what they're for 
 but I don't don't remember them 
 and I think it's I think I can think of movies I have less fun during 
 and then after the movie's over I remember it so terribly well because it it had some some meaning to me or something
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 they leave 
 yeah 
 they leave they leave some songs with you 
 I don't know what it is
 but it just 
 I mean I don't know if this is old fart talking here or something because I'm not that old 
 you know those old movies seemed to have had something that uh that was memorable somehow 
 I don't know what it was
 Okay 
 well um thanks for hearing me rap I guess 
 All right 
 nice talking with you
 No 
 I'm in California 
 Yeah 
 there must be Texas people as near as I can tell 
 Well 
 Okay

 All right 
 bye-bye
