 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'm here
 Uh well only my um my grandmother but for a very short time 
 Um she uh she was just more or less in a in a nursing home for uh recovery from a broken hip because she could receive more medical attention
 But um that 
 physical therapy was there and whatever 
 but I think in visiting her there um it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in uh weren't there mentally 
 Uh she was probably the only person in the um whole nursing home that uh still had all of her mental facilities about her 
 So that was uh that was very disheartening
 Oh yeah 
 it's really hard I guess 
 I I come from a family of um of uh take care of your elders I guess 
 Uh my my dad's mother is an invalid 
 and she lives with my aunt and uncle 
 and they care for her you know all around the clock 
 Though she's not uh she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention she because of arthritis she's just unable to get out of bed 
 So I guess you know there's that family commitment 
 Um I know that my parents my mother is trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can Um
 Yeah
 Right 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 well probably I think as long as the person's able to um to understand what's going on around them 
 and I think you know my grandmother right now is still able to walk around
 and she's still able to uh to do some things for herself though she gets Meals On Wheels which I think is a great thing because um it saves people from having to prepare food for her because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on or whatever although she does most things very well it still makes a little bit easier for her
 Uh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 that 
 I think you know it's really funny 
 I have two grandmothers still alive 
 and my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible 
 She's like openly told people 
 She's always been very good about knowing 
 yes she's eighty-nine 
 and she said that she would really like to stay in her house as long as possible because it's her home
 But when the time comes um she and she can't do things 
 and she has to be cared for whatever she would prefer and she's actually said this to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment uh probably with like a living space and a bedroom with maybe a kitchenette so that if she you know if she wants to fix herself something light she can do that 
 but if she wants to go to a meal she can go down the hallway uh to a room where there's a cafeteria
 and there's other people there 
 and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 I think I think that probably until until they're really invalids uh the elderly are invalids I think that they should be able to interact with other people in an environment that they choose if they can if the family can afford it
 I mean um see I know that my grandmother would like to stay in her house 
 and my parents actually said you know that they may have to take their end sometime so because you know my grandma she says who she wants to live with 
 she's pretty you know 
 she lets people know
