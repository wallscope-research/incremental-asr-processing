 Um what do you think the major cause of air pollution or at least in the Boston areas 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Um that isn't the same in the Washington area because we don't have any major um industry except for uh government and services 
 And the the transportation situation is such that uh all the car pollution is is absolutely awful 
 Um also the worth of the hub of three airports 
 in this general area there is uh National Dulles and then uh Baltimore Washington 
 And it 
 interestingly some of the information I've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from uh uh airplanes is extraordinary
 Yeah
 and that's always something that you know you just don't real you don't think about
 But the uh 
 apparently the air pollution and the fact that it's delivered right up in high altitudes is a very significant factor
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Society has especially recently 
 I mean you know what it's like here 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah
 We just had the 
 That's right 
 So solutions to this would be 
 I I 
 you know improved 
 Well I guess the fur- the to me the first thing is I wish society would get as upset about this as you do get getting people upset about animal rights
 I mean this is so so basic 
 It's human rights in the sense 
 but uh in terms of demanding it's just not caused 
 but demanding that uh we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed toward um improvement of polluting vehicles and not just cars but also buses um planes That something can be done I me- I can't imagine that well 
 if we can't send people to the moon that we can't improve these things 
 Converter 
 yeah 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And that for buses 
 That's right 
 Well and also to make it economically feasible Uh and per- ti- also in buses 
 I don't know if you ever got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus
 That you know 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 but even of course in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels 
 I mean I'm I'm thinking of research in that direction rather than 
 we we've taken the intermediate step 
 but I don't think fossil fuels are the answer
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I me- 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you don't throw the baby out with the bath water and condemning nuclear use
 Yeah 
 yeah
 But with the pollution issue uh fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway
 Uh so you've to lo- you've got to look elsewhere
 So uh but it is something that's a little frightening 
 and in fact well I 
 within our family we have said 
 my husband 
 I have two sons uh well 
 one is already in college in New England
 and the other will be going in September 
 and we just feel that when we leave uh this area w- we're going north not south
 Uh I like the mentality north 
 and I also like the fresher air up there
 So I mean that's the way we will be going
 But um so I i- I'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how they their attitudes are
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 The smog and 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 I mean even California was notorious for its smog years ago before it even was an issue out here
 Well that that's that's person- that's personal air pollution 
 Yes 
 yes
 Yeah 
 well I I d- definitely advance that 
 Well listen I enjoyed speaking with you
 And let's hope some there are other people that feel the same way 
 You're welcome
 Bye-bye
