 I know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now
 Yeah 
 um well I know that they're they're real cautious about letting Middle Eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism 
 What What What all do you know about it
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 Uh-huh
 There I don't think there's much of much of one because I'm sure all the people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in
 And uh most of them it's just like Australia most of them were criminals from Cuba
 and I think that was just an attempt that that Fidel Castro to undermine you know the United States to some extent 
 So he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us
 And it's almost the same thing in in uh from Asia because <> a lot a lot of them was put out of business in Vietnam after the war 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and a lot of the Mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work
 and they have green cards 
 And uh then like you said a lot of 
 I run into people every day that can't speak English
 And uh and and most of them you know are working in janitorial positions 
 so So I I don't know 
 like you said I don't know how much how much they're taking from the work force you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's 
 I 
 yeah 
 I took Spanish in school 
 and that's you know one reason that I did it is because because whenever you travel anywhere near the border you know there more and more people speak Spanish
 Well yeah 
 well it's basically on the well 
 I think it's mostly concentrated toward the borders 
 and uh it's more um 
 the immigration is tied in with uh drug trafficking 
 So they have to watch out who comes in 
 and and they're always finding drugs on you know on the most um <> innocent looking kind of 
 I forgot what they found 
 but a dog found it the other day you know on the border
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 Well *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 and one of the one of the things that really gets to me uh about the Mexicans is that um once they have children over here their children are American citizens then
 Yeah 
 and then they'll ship the parents back 
 and that leaves the children without any parents 
 So And they you know and and they just follow the rule no matter you know 
 So that doesn't seem fair to the children
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and then they granted them amnesty if they could prove when was that it was in the eighties some time if they could prove they'd been here five years
 And uh a lot of them had been you know
 Some of them some of them moved back and forth 
 but uh most of them don't ever want to go back to Mexico 
 especially the way it was then 
 Uh-huh
 I think most you know like especially the celebrities and everything they just have a uh well they have to get a green card if they going to do any kind of work you know in movies and and such 
 But most of them have temporary visas
 As long it's like well 
 it's a kind of a bad a bad bad example 
 but when Rafael Septien took the job with the Cowboys they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it
 Yeah
 So that you know 
 and that's the thing with the jobs
 And of course no one beat him out
 So you know He just ruined his own career 
 so 
 Yeah 
 <> Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think so 
 Because there are other I j- uh job opportunities in Europe that there aren't here you know even um 
 like or- orchestra players can find a job sometimes <> in Europe when they can't find one here
 And I'm a trumpet player
 Uh no 
 I uh I don't any more 
 I just went to school 
 and I was a music major for a while
 But I had a trumpet teacher that played in the Mexico City Symphony 
 So so he had to have a work visa there
 And of course they had a lot of musicians from from other countries and uh in the Mexico City Symphony
 But I think um like three out of the four other people in the trumpet section are from Mexico now
 But I think the conductor I don't know or one of the conductors is is from another country
 It's like any other symphony
 You know and then and Eduardo Mana's from Mexico 
 so he had to
