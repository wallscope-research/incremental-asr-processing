 Okay
 Capital punishment
 Um for myself I'm personally against it 
 but we seem to have a duality of in this country where most states in theory have it but but but do not use it
 Okay well
 Uh Texas uses it as about as much as any other state
 Texas is a big state
 Um here in Maryland to the capital punishment law 
 people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment but no one no one has actually has the sentence carried out 
 Uh I'd certainly 
 Uh-huh 
 I think so
 I uh 
 or affair number 
 uh in fact I think that it it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available 
 the sentence of life without possibility of parole uh has become a common one and is being being used much more
 Uh I don't know the exact numbers 
 but but yes 
 prisons are overcrowded
 Um
 Okay 
 you're you're certainly in the majority uh at least in this country
 Uh we are I guess the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment
 No 
 at least not in Western Europe 
 Probably not in Eastern Europe these days either 
 Um there are many reasons for it 
 but they they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates
 Well in part it's uh it's the nature of societies perhaps more homogenous society in many cases uh 
 arguably if 
 arguably is because of of uh of uh welfare state benefits 
 Though I tend to be we tend to be skeptical
 Yes 
 oh there's no question that that they that uh you know they have you know all kinds of cradle to grave uh programs welfare programs providing for everyone some way 
 I I I 
 however the question is is that making the difference
 Oh
 Um I think I think that idea is even even more common in Western Europe
 Uh-huh
 Me too
