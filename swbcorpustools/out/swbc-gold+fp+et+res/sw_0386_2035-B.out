 or we go in the backyard and sit down 
 an 
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and with you know me being at home and just having the one income you know you don't have this lot of extra money to to do a lot of you know extra things
 So you you make more fun than you know 
 You know the kids just think it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or yeah or uh you know go get a bag of M and M's or something like that 
 they they think that's a lot of fun 
 So we just we try to spend as much time as we can 
 We you know 
 our our whole weekends are divi- are devoted to our children except for we might go out you know one evening or something
 but during the day you know it's all devoted to our kids 
 and they come go to church with us 
 and so 
 Yeah 
 so 
 Yes 
 yes 
 that's what 
 Uh-huh 
 the kids thought that was wonderful
 I is I'm not sure which one we went into 
 it was about a year or so ago when we went
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 they had a lot of fun in there 
 and uh there's uh there's some petting you know like uh uh 
 I think it's Owens Country Farms has a free petting you know like a farm that you can go to 
 and the kids can pet animals and stuff
 That's on Plano Road 
 uh it's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road 
 it's like a little bit past Campbell and Plano Road 
 And that's a lot of fun
 They have tours going through there 
 and uh the kids think that was a lot of fun too
 We take you know whenever we take them to Showbiz 
 or they think it's wonderful just to go to McDonalds you know 
 they don't go for the food 
 they go for the to play around 
 and There's another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business
 and it's a indoor fun park 
 and it has a bunch of different rides for kids
 And parents get in free 
 and it's like during the week 
 it's like five dollars admission per child all day
 The petting farm 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and the one in Mesquite is uh Scyene exit
 And it's it's uh 
 the kids just had a wonderful time there 
 they you know you just pay that admission 
 and then all the the the rides are free 
 You know of course they have all the little video games and you know those little quarter rides you know to and stuff like that 
 but they thought that was lot of fun 
 You can have birthday parties there 
 an I think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza cause there's more for them to do
 Yeah 
 right
 So they had a lot of fun
 Yeah 
 I we try to do a lot of things as a family and you know inexpensively as possible 
 so
