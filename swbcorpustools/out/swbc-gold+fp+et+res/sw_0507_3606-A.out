 What are your favorite shows
 Uh-huh
 I've never seen that
 Huh-uh
 Um I like L A LAW not because it's realistic but it's entertaining
 Um
 Let's see 
 I watch CHEERS sometimes And mostly just movies when there's a good movie on
 Actually when there isn't a good movie on too
 I just like to have the T V on if you know if I'm home alone or something
 have 
 either the radio or the T Vs got to be on the whole time
 Oh really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I well I don't because I work all day
 But um I pro- 
 I usually do if I'm home for a couple of days like you know around Christmas or whatever 
 after a while I'll start watching it
 and then on 
 for a while I'll ask people if they know what happened
 and then I'll just forget it
 Uh I don't even remember 
 the last time I watched was back in college 
 It was like GENERAL HOSPITAL or something
 and I maybe watched it for a week
 but um I know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the you know 
 they wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera
 It was a 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well you said you have kids 
 How old
 So you're you aren't a SESAME STREET fan
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Supposed to be a great babysitter 
 Yeah
 Um
 Uh-huh
 I know 
 what time is that on 
 *[[listen; strange placement]] I never see it
 Oh okay 
 I'm not home then 
 that's why I don't see it
 Isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 What's that
 Yeah 
 well I guess it wasn't a real good topic for us 
 but Well tell me 
 is it snowing up there
 No
 Uh-huh
 Wow But do you have snow on the ground now
 *[[two utts]] Oh
 Well that's nice
 Oh gosh 
 we've broken all sorts of records
 They've got 
 I mean we still have some highways closed 
 and it stopped raining almost twenty-four hours ago
 But um oh just phenomenal 
 I mean I you know 
 you see it on the news all the time 
 but until you've really seen it it does- it doesn't really hit you
 But I was driving home from work Friday 
 and I saw there were some stop signs I mean submerged up to the writing on the stop sign 
 and that was just 
 it was amazing to me
 So
 Oh there's been a lot 
 yeah
 It's it's too bad 
 but you know the thing is that this happens 
 in the last three years it's happened at least once a year if not twice But the people continue to move back in the flood zones
 So I don't know 
 I mean you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for
 I don't think I would
 Because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I do 
 yeah
 Have you made a lot of calls 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Do you get paid for these
 Five dollars a call
 Gosh 
 I wish I could do that 
 We can't get paid for it
