 Yes sir
 Well there is two kinds 
 One I guess I'd say is with my wife where we enjoy uh oh I guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant 
 Uh you know something nice
 And the other is with my whole family whom we uh go somewhere that the kids will enjoy 
 Uh recently we have been hitting Pancho's up 
 It's a local Mexican restaurant
 because they have got a good rate on you know good prices and everything
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 it's it's a chain down he- uh 
 it goes up into Colorado and down here 
 I don't know where else it is 
 What about you 
 Oh yeah
 I think think it might be 
 I've se- I think I've seen it around 
 Yes sir 
 Yeah 
 Oh do you 
 Yeah
 Oh we we do too 
 We uh we enjoy Mexican food
 I'm just not impressed with the quality of it 
 It's just primarily the price that's uh satisfying at this point 
 But the kids seem to enjoy it
 Uh and uh let's see 
 We've uh just recently discovered a super restaurant down here 
 but it's uh not part of a chain 
 it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant 
 But the first one we've been to that uh I don't think there was anything on the menu that that any of us had 
 that was uh not just really super 
 It's nice to find a place like that
 Yeah
 Um
 Oh boy
 Have you ever been to uh what is it Original Book Binders in Philadelphia
 Uh that's an old established uh restaurant 
 I used to go there when I was in college
 Uh I went to the Naval Academy
 And we used to we use to go up there on uh for football games sometimes And have some liberty 
 And 
 yeah 
 we would go over there to uh 
 pr- pretty sure it was original Original Book Binders 
 I think it was 
 yes
 I haven't been back there in years
 Okay 
 What area
 Is that right 
 Did you have any dealings with the uh underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando Florida
 Yes sir 
 My dad worked there for years and years
 That's wh- that's uh that's where I grew up was down in Orlando 
 So 
 That's uh that's interesting Well I was in submarines Uh
 Okay

 must have had some interesting uh assignments for you there 
 Wh- when did you retire
 Well great 
 I'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics
 Yeah
 Okay
 Right 
 Where's 
 Oh we we do enjoy that 
 Yes sir 
 Uh I don't know if we are particularly adventurous 
 we find something we like uh like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good uh at a particular restaurant 
 and then we usually stick by it 
 But do you What about you
 Hot
 Uh-huh
 Um Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food
 I guess one of the things we've uh started avoiding is the uh run of the mill chop suey and things like that
 But we enjoy trying uh different kinds of chicken or uh sh- you know even uh shrimp uh dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant
 Okay 
 thanks for that uh reference
 Okay 
 good 
 Yeah
