 Uh do you want to give a start on it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-uh
 Oh definitely
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 You can relate to that 
 Now see we didn't we don't have any of that because well like we live in the country in Clarion County 
 and uh we really didn't have things like that going on that we you know uh ran into 
 So we kind of uh 
 I guess when I think of social changes I think think more of uh uh visiting habits of families and such
 Uh
 Yeah 
 that there's less visiting done I think on a whole than there used to be 
 Used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or not 
 you went visiting 
 And uh today you know people they do visit 
 but it's not quite the same as uh what it was say twenty years ago thirty years ago
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well they're so spread out 
 I think has a lot to do with it
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 That's right 
 yeah
 The majority 
 yeah
 Probably 
 because when you work you don't really care to go out and visit as much
 And uh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 No 
 huh-uh 
 they don't do as much
 Uh-huh
 You have to make arrangements or have an invitation or 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well that could be part of it 
 I don't know for sure what it is 
 I know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance so we really don't have that even 
 We don't 
 Oh really
 Oh that's pretty good
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well apparently there must be work available for those that are
 Uh-huh 
 Because around here there's really nothing for the young people 
 no good I mean there's jobs 
 There's minimum wage jobs 
 but uh to make a good living there really around here there just isn't too much
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So well there's the main things I can think of 
 I really tried to think of some other things 
 and I couldn't really
 Yeah 
 definitely
 Some good and some bad 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 They'd rather get their life started first before 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well even to get school finished I think 
 a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in 
 Because a marriage takes a lot of effort and concentration 
 and if you're busy with school it's I think it's really difficult for a family
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Yeah 
 I know my my daughter that lives in Pittsburgh she has two little boys 
 and they they've been in day care since you know 
 one's four 
 and one's one
 and they've done well 
 Now I wouldn't want to do it that way 
 but uh she's quite happy 
 and the children seem quite adjusted
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 yeah
 Yes 
 uh-huh
 That's right 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Now I'm going to baby-sit my granddaughter 
 She's just eight weeks old 
 so this will be new for me 
 So uh but the others I'm too far away to help them out at all
 Uh well I have a son and daughter that live in Pittsburgh One in Maryland and one in Connecticut 
 A son in Connecticut
 No 
 but like Connecticut takes eight hours to drive home 
 and uh it's too far to you know really go too often
 Pittsburgh's not quite so bad 
 It's just a couple hours 
 Maryland maybe five hour drive
 Uh-huh 
 That's worse yet
 Oh are you really
 Do you uh stay overnight on the way 
 or you 
 You're young
 How old are you
 Okay 
 well you're young enough yet to 
 Uh-huh
 It's work to get there 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Now my son 
 they they flew 
 he rebuilt a Aranca Chief airplane 
 and they flew down last weekend 
 They came down in it 
 And it still took a long time because it's not a fast it's not a high-speed airplane
 But they enjoyed in thoroughly 
 So 
 I'm not sure 
 but you have to change phones 
 You have to call from another a different
