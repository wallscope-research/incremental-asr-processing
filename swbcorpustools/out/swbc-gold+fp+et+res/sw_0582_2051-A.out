 All right um 
 I think the topic was crime in the city
 I do not live in a city 
 I live in a real small little place
 Uh it's about thirty miles from Sherman
 It's north of Sherman
 Not too far
 Huh-uh
 Uh I've been through there
 Okay 
 Oh yeah 
 I had been through Saint Joe 
 but um just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad
 Huh-uh
 Oh yeah
 Sure
 Huh-uh
 Oh I know 
 I know 
 I know 
 Um I think nowadays people just really just murder is nothing to them you know
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 because uh most likely that will happen won't it that you know 
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 No
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Um
 Huh-uh
 Um So you're you're kind of thinking 
 in other words if you get if you do something the first time that's not real bad you know
 yeah 
 to go ahead and let them go 
 but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then uh 
 Oh
 Huh-uh
 Yeah

 because look how many years they've been doing that 
 and look

 I know 
 Yeah
 Oh I'm I agree very much so on that

 Sure 
 they just think that's the normal thing to do don't they 
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 In the first grade 
 Oh know 
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Oh I know 
 I know um 
 I work in school You know 
 that's something I do 
 and I it really is 
 I'm like you 
 astonishing what the younger ages know 
 and they react to what they see at home You know
 If they see violence at home that's what you're going to get from the kids at school
 You know It really is 
 and that's kind of sad
