 Well I think I think basically we're in a lot of agreement uh in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs uh some kind of legal definition
 But for anything involving that trial by jury certainly should be mandatory
 But there should be with our overworked uh judicial system 
 it seems to me like there ought to be a means of of um not having to take everything before a full court You know 
 maybe there ought to be some kind of of uh 
 isn't there a type of word called a jury duty now
 And maybe instead of of uh just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do maybe we should commit to spend a week 
 and during that week you're kind of an ad hoc let's hear about it group of I don't know twenty-five instead of twelve
 and each case is presented to that group of twenty-five 
 and those cases are uh lesser degrees of magnitude You know 
 the guy was caught burgling 
 and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught
 you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say your pleasure your honor 
 and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing
 But the way our system our court system works that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time
 I just think our system is overworked 
 and we're starting to stretch the true meaning of of right to a speedy trial
 You know we 
 You know kind of off what we've been talking about here uh I believe that our we've become almost a litigious society where we everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff 
 and although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we don't need to do that
 You know maybe instead of being so quick to sue you uh if you have a disagreement with someone instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you nee- maybe you 
 and if you want to your lawyer or your your opponent need to go face this group of twenty-five or a judge like they have on T V
 and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case
 And let's you know let's get rid of some of this harassment suing
 You bet 
 and if If we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the 
 Yes 
 I'd forgotten what that's called 
 There's a a real name for that like the Judean law or something like that
 Well that may be right 
 It's in there some place
 I think we both know that we're talking about the foundation of our legal society
 Uh and too the 
 that was sort of the beginning of Ye shall be treated fairly
 Uh I guess the Lord started out with we'll treat you fa- I'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what I say 
 Uh that's sort of the Old Testament version
 I know 
 I did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament where where there's a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there's a loving Lord in the New Testament 
 But that's a whole different subject
 Okay 
 well I I think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on on the legal system
 But it's been a pleasure talking with you
 I'm living here in Texas
 Well that's quite all right
 Well so am I 
 In fact I'm at work out at Lewisville
 My pleasure 
 Have a good day
 Bye-bye
