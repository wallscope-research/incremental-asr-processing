 Okay 
 wow I don't know what that was
 I don't know 
 Uh-huh
 Oh yes
 Uh-huh 
 uh we have not camped in any of those places 
 in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped 
 but we used to go to Tyler State Park and uh Daingerfield 
 and in Texas that is where we camp basically Uh
 They are very nice 
 Tyler is really really a neat place to camp 
 It has a nice little lake 
 and it has some really wonderful uh sights that are in the wooded areas 
 Uh the facilities are quite nice 
 and our children liked liked it quite well 
 Uh the kids are well they are quite a bit younger than 
 *[[should be 'then']] and you know they 
 we felt real safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area 
 And uh it was just it was just a really nice place to camp
 Uh now Daingerfield is 
 let's see 
 I think that's a little bit mor- more east further east and and maybe south if I am remembering where that is 
 No 
 I think it's a little bit further north when I think about it 
 At any rate it was it was very nice as well 
 But Tyler we sort of got spoiled with I think
 But uh we had lived in Michigan before we came here and uh had done a lot of camping in Michigan 
 I think the upper peninsula of Michigan especially 
 and then also we had done some camping in Colorado in the mountains 
 so uh my parents were real avid campers 
 and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well 
 So I guess we just kind of came by it naturally 
 Do you have a large tent 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 And how many does it sleep uh comfortably
 Right 
 Yeah
 Well sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger uh we invested in some stacking uh cots you know that were like bunk bunk beds 
 but they were cots fold up cots 
 That really gave us a lot more space um floor space and so you did not have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around 
 and 
 uh gave us a place to stack things during the day 
 so that was real nice 
 But uh we uh 
 like my in-laws also had a camper or uh a pop up tent you know one of those trailer tops 
 and those are really nice too 
 A little more uh luxurious so to speak but not much 
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 It's really nice 
 in fact it even had had a little refrigerator uh and the whole business 
 It was quite nice in that respect 
 Uh and everything was very convenient 
 and you did not have to to be hauling things out of your the trunk of you car
 and that was nice 
 So uh do you have plans for for any other camping trips in the near future
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh yes
 Yes 
 yes 
 I have been in that area 
 That is a really pretty state park 
 Uh just 
 we did not camp there 
 but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area 
 and it's real lovely 
 It's close to the lake and close to 
 I think it's close to the dam up there 
 so it's it's really quite pretty 
 Uh are you um 
 let's see what was 
 I was going to ask you something else 
 Oh do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to
 Yeah 
 uh-huh 
 Uh is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in the State of Texas
 I I would 
 I have never been there 
 and I would love to see what it looks like 
 Uh-huh
 Oh I see
 How interesting
 I guess I never heard the history of that 
 Huh well that might be some place where my husband and I can go 
 We are talking about starting camping again in the fall 
 Um our children are both grown 
 and and so it's just pretty much the two of us who do things 
 And so uh we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to to go to and see what it looks like
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Is it 
 Uh yeah 
 I think so 
 Especially with uh uh 
 when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty
 especially in East Texas it's really nice 
 So uh well I um I have enjoyed talking with you
 And um have uh some happy camping trips 
 Hope you get to those places you have talked about
 Well okay 
 thanks
 Uh-huh 
 bye-bye
