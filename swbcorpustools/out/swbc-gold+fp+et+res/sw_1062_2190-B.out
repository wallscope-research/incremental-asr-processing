 Oh well I'm not an expert 
 I just had a little I've I've seen a little pollution in my time 
 It's uh 
 the the chemicals we were dealing with were uh a Raid repellent 
 and uh that was really quite dangerous 
 I'm not certain that that was 
 that that's really a pollution issue 
 I think pollution issue is is uh is is the argument over over people catching uh things like uh respiratory disease
 Well the you know 
 that that's another arguable issue 
 and I I've seen the uh uh uh 
 assuming you can buy into global warming I bi- 
 Well did you see Carl Sagan on SIXTY MINUTES on uh when he was talking about when if if the if the war started in in Kuwait and they'd set those uh all th- 
 uh it was it was it was interesting 
 but uh I'm just curious what he has to say now that they've got them all lit
 Yes 
 And his argument was uh was that that you would see a uh a year with no summer Which actually happened 
 And it it ac- 
 yes 
 it actually happened 
 uh it was a volcano erupted 
 and it was high enough up 
 but uh they had some people from the national meteorological center I think it was which is the national anyway research people 
 and they said that the uh that the pollution would not go high enough 
 And it's going to be interesting to see if Carl Sagan and his billions and billions of stars may have once made a mistake 
 but th- th- th- the the com- the general the opinion among among the uh meteorologists at uh 
 I'm uh member of the American Meteorological Society 
 and an- 
 Yeah 
 I do
 But I'm uh I th- I did that in my 
 No I'm a planner a production planner 
 But I I I'm in the active reserves as a weatherman 
 so 
 Uh I I keep up from time to time 
 but what [ the the argument is that uh that uh maybe there isn't global warming and maybe there is 
 But um if there is uh we probably could do something about it now
 and if there isn't if there isn't and we do some the right things I think 
 how do you feel about about all this smog and th- stuff on cars
 Well do you have an older car
 I I have been working on an older car 
 but it to- 
 yeah 
 Well I'm restoring one
 I'm not having any problem it's a seventy
 And the 
 But did you have another ques- 
 you said you had another quest- 
 Uh e- 
 No 
 I didn't see that that 
 I know that the uh 
 that's 
 Well that 
 they called nuclear winner 
 and and I suppose that's that's the ultimate uh pollution problem
 Well it 
 Well the Chernobyl accident uh 
 actually um because the circulation budget as high as it went uh covered uh a fairly remarkable amount 
 they did some tracers 
 and they 
 I I think it's drawn in uh 
 I think gets in there 
 I can't think of the other trace 
 but I saw a a presentation on on that 
 and they 
 it went quite a long ways but I I I guess I can be a little sympathetic 
 but you know there's some argument that in in in the blue grass of Kentucky that the Smoky Mountains that that's the uh the pine trees giving off pollution 
 and 
 But the 
 but when you se- when you get up in the morning in in Dallas and and see all that haze from west Texas is that is that pollution
 Well it 
 that's the thing is that I think I think Dallas really does have a problem in this 
 the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel burning fuel 
 the problem is is it's like Los Angeles 
 People don't people don't want to use mass transit 
 so 
 But who wants to who wants to um ride a bus
 Well my boss drives forty miles one way each day
 And one of the guys that works with me drives forty-five miles
 And and they don't think it 
 well I guess they do think something of it 
 but um not even to you know 
 you consider how much um 
 but then you get into all these issues of of whether it it's the types of pollution and what it's doing to your lungs 
 and are we going to die of of respiratory 
 so we all move out of the out of downtown 
 so we get away from the the smog 
 My my wife grew up in southern California 
 and they moved out to the valley before Los Angeles uh wh- when the valley was clean
 And now the valley is not 
 and so people move out one more valley and 
 Yes yes Well do General Motors apparently has one that they're they're testing 
 I think it's no it's alcohol vehicles that they're testing 
 But they suppose 
 Huh 
 Well the ROAD and TRACK was talking about that this apparently General Motors has some uh 
 they apparently think they're close
 Well th- there's still a lot of research 
 I was over in in the research lab a couple I guess it's been about a month ago 
 and saw this research it was a little light that says solar solar powered research
 Yeah 
 Well do you work in that C building
 Oh I'm at 
 Oh well I'm in I'm in the C building 
 been there for all my life 
 Huh
 Well that's been a con- 
 I know the focal plain array is they were taking space to a long time
 Well the problem is that gas at a dollar a gallon you know who wants to 
 yeah 
 I mean we want to not pollute 
 but uh at a dollar a gallon uh it's hard to beat the amount of energy you get from uh 
 Well I thought I saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol 
 they had one with spots on it and something
 I didn't go 
 but i- 
 wa- 
 it was showing they 
 I mean uh 
 an article 
 No 
 I didn't
 I didn't go 
 so I wh- 
 They've done a lot
 Well ther- 
 Well they uh 
 it's interesting though because my cars are older 
 and so I didn't have to 
 if you live in Dallas County you have to have your have to have it checked 
 and it's 
 I had a friend with a Fiero that uh they tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of terrible getting that pinned 
 and so apparently
