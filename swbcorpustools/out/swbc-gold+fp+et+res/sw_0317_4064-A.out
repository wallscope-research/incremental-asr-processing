 Well how do you feel about trial by jury
 In what way
 Oh do do you feel they are swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits
 So do you think that I mean the the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry
 Uh-huh 
 <> The other thing the only thing that really bothers me about that is I think you know that a judge can be 
 I I like the idea of juries of your peers uh in that you you you get more personally more than one person making the making a decision 
 And second of all you get a wide variety of background 
 so that 
 Uh-huh 
 I'd agree with that 
 That's definitely a problem
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I guess I I definitely agree with you 
 but sin- the 
 well what I don't like about uh sentence the jury doing the sentencing in that I think it becomes a lot less 
 the the same crime gets unequal sentences
 I uh I think there is more of an ability of you know you know for selecting a jury two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea uh the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent
 but I think I think there would be a large variation in in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Of course a lot of that's also the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I agree 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Oh yeah 
 I I agree with it 
 yeah 
 They will admit to you that they can- don't have the benefit of being able to you know of of letting allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty
 it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument
 That the <> 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh this is a little bit of the subject 
 but one one thing that I really dislike uh also that's that's new is the uh is that I have heard that there are federal sentences
