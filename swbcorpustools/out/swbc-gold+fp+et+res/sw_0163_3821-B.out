 Yeah
 Is that right 
 I I know pe- I know some other people that have done that
 Um
 Uh-huh <>
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I h- I have we have some some friends that did the exactly the same thing
 They uh you know they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed 
 and finally they realized that they were they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole 
 and they just cut them all up except for for one they kept for emergencies 
 and they're still paying away to get out of debt
 But no 
 I did just the opposite 
 I I guess I I sort of followed in my uh parents' footsteps 
 I have quite a few of them 
 I use them continually
 but I uh I basically never charge anything I don't have the money in the bank to pay for 
 And uh and I always pay them off totally every month 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and it you know I mean they they're just a convenience for me 
 I don't have to get cash out of the bank 
 and I don't have to to be writing checks 
 and and uh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I mean it it's easy 
 I mean you don't have anything transferring just a little signature 
 so what you know 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Surprising
 Yeah
 Well you know but the 
 I mean there are sort some inherent limits there 
 you're not going to you're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that 
 right
 Now I 
 W- 
 the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really you know uh not so much discipline 
 I mean well I mean you have sort of a discipline in general about finances 
 but but I hate their their rates so badly I mean their interest rates so badly that I 
 I'm uh thirty-three
 Thirty-two 
 excuse me
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 You know I just that just irritates me so much that that I refuse to pay them interest 
 and and my wife recently uh decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off 
 and she's from there and and uh didn't really have the money 
 but you know she could pay it off 
 and so I sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards 
 but she's paying it 
 and uh I just won't do it 
 I mean she's paying I don't know I don't know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest
 and I just you know I just refuse to give it to them 
 If I need to borrow that kind of money I'll go to the bank 
 and uh 
 You know 
 Income 
 Oh yeah
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 High 
 I might 
 Um
 Right
 Um I might try that because I I have one card that I've had for about uh I don't know nine or ten years
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 for me the big thing you know is the uh uh is the annual fee 
 and I just refuse 
 I won't get any card now 
 I've I've got a good rating 
 and I've got you know 
 And I'm not going I'm not going to pay an annual fee 
 The only one I actually pay on is this one that I that the very first
