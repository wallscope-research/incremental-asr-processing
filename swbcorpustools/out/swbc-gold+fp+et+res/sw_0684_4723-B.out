 So what sort of car are you interested in getting next
 Ah 
 Uh well I understand and can sympathize with that because I also enjoy driving performance automobiles 
 Uh I currently have an eighty-seven five liter Mustang G T that I've done a bunch of modifications to to make it uh handle and perform better
 and I suspect if I were to be able to get another car where object was uh 
 the best car I could get regardless of money uh I probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari
 A a three twenty-eight G T S
 You just go hunting 
 Go out and lust after it
 So have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari
 
 uh
 Yeah 
 there there's something about having a place to live 
 I don't know 
 Could sleep in the back of the 'vette
 I find that uh that the Corvettes are are becoming really really nice cars
 Yeah 
 And they they've improved the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive
 It's not like driving a a Winnebago or something
 Nice 
 Yeah 
 Nice isn't the word I'd choose 
 Maybe practical
 Isn't that a practical van 
 Yeah 
 It it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive
 Well so it was a completely new experience for you 
 And I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it
 Right
 And and you couldn't get 
 how long does it take to go back up About the same time 
 Yeah 
 so 
 So you won't get 
 Yeah 
 and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial
 Whoops
 Yeah 
 Oh No I was just down in Austin last week 
 and the weather was pretty nice too 
 So 
 With the Bluebonnets out 
 yeah 
 It really was 
 Yeah 
 I decided that Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living
