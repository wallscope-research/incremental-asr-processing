 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I I think we have a neighborhood watch 
 I think
 I'm not real 
 we don't get real involved 
 We're never home 
 so 
 uh uh well I know they were going to start one 
 but uh I haven't heard any more since 
 so I don't really know 
 But as far as personally doing something no
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Huh
 Oh I'm sure it is
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um I would too if I had kids 
 We don't have any 
 We did install a a a uh motion detector light back in our driveway
 And that was mainly it was so when we pulled up the light would come on 
 but also we have a boat back there
 and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief 
 so 
 we thought with that light you know it would maybe keep them from doing something to the boat 
 Yeah 
 so 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's 
 what it is 
 We live in Coppell 
 and and that's pretty much what it is is you know kids that are bored like you say
 Uh-huh
 Oh no
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I know it Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah

 Really is <>
 Yeah 
 I'm originally from Chicago but I've been in this area in the Lewisville area for uh let's see about twenty-three years
 Oh definitely 
 In the last few years I think 
 and uh like I say 
 now I don't think necessarily in this area here but just Dallas in general 
 I don't know 
 I think back of when I was uh younger and in my party days some of the things I did you know I wouldn't be caught dead like being out that late at night In the dark parking lot 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
