 Do you work with do you work around children when you work
 With computers
 Okay 
 do you ha- 
 but you have friends that have children
 Uh-huh
 What is child care like in New York 
 What is 
 Does the company you work for have child care on premises for employees
 Oh
 Oh my
 A sabbatical 
 Well I hope you can stay as long as possible with it
 Oh yeah 
 that would be wonderful Right 
 Right
 Right
 I think it does when when they are real little 
 and they are changing every day
 there's 
 and you just miss the little things
 and and uh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 That's right
 That's right
 Right
 Right 
 Well that it is important for the bonding that they do it with the mother
 Right
 Our oldest grandson when he was eighteen months old went into a a Montessori day care system 
 And they took infants starting at six weeks 
 and they have a program uh in that was devised by this montessori person 
 and uh and a certain type of stimulations 
 and there's times of day that even when the child is awake that they that they lay quietly and look at certain things 
 they keep deliberately keep the room not real bright
 And and uh they have different things they will they will put them down on the floor 
 and of course they never have more than like five 
 and and they will put them down on the floor 
 and they will have on- I think one of them was a little mirror 
 and some were just different objects that have had a definite purpose for kids you know 
 and there's something about their eyes
 Uh
 How old is she
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 A little older 
 It is because that's when they are clinging to mama
 so you might have a real problem with that 
 I think it it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying 
 so it you know it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place
 But that's unusual
 Uh-huh
 Is it your parents or your husband's parents
 Oh
 Right 
 right 
 That's nice when uh 
 I my I have three grandchildren 
 another one coming in September 
 and I 
 it would if they were where I could not get my hands on them I am afraid I would probably go crazy
 You know I I like that
 but if it you do not have to put them in child care that's that's an ideal situation for you is to stay with them 
 as 
 or you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time
 That's that's wonderful for the child 
 But 
 Right 
 And you need to look at when you if you do decide to go with child care you really need to to look at what your options are and and look at the what they offer 
 drop in at times that are unexpected
 The 
 Uh
 Uh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Oh
 Oh that would be wonderful
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Oh
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I do too
 Really well trained people
 Right
 and have have some kind of real good program set up so that you when you go you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows C P R or first aid 
 or and have some kind of program set up like you say to stimulate the kids or educate them in some manner And have the you know the right toys and the right setting and uh have a an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule you know 
 that's real important to little kids
 Uh-huh
 They they adjust to what the parents 
 Uh-huh
 We- you know that works until they start school
 And that's a problem 
 society is geared to a a day person 
 and it's 
 I have another friend who's brother and his wife have done this 
 they stay up until all hours of the night
