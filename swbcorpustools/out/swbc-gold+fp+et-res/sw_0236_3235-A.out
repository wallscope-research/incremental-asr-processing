 what do you feel is the major change that's been going on
 I think that has been the major change is that women feel they need to go out and do this 
 they no longer feel uh it's no big deal to stay home and raise your family any more
 I know it 
 and I think that's really sad because I think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else
 You don't well 
 I'm still home with my last one 
 and I wouldn't change a minute of it for anything 
 But I can't help but think that eventually the pendulum's going to swing back the other way again
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 that's 
 Yeah 
 it's sad
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life-style than necessary
 uh you know to 
 I don't think you know the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars and this type of thing 
 I think that they would from the you know attention or whatever
 {F uh but it 
 I don't know 
 I see it as a major problem 
 and I think it's going to have to swing back the other way because I think we're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this
 Uh-huh
 what grade do you teach
 Six seven and eight 
 I've got a chi- uh 
 where do you live 
 Are you out 
 In Richardson 
 we're in Plano here
 I have a daughter in middle school 
 and uh I know there aren't very many 
 she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home 
 but do you ever see problems you know that you feel you know that the kids are left alone too much 
 and 
 He stays at school
 And the school allows that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh my
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 No mother to talk to
 Well I've just 
 do you feel it will swing back the other way 
 or do you feel there's just going to be a big push uh you know for more and more day care type situations
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
