 All right 
 so we started recording already
 Oh so you pressed one
 Okay 
 So I guess we're supposed to start talking 
 Uh what kind of books do you read
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So it's mostly all novels
 Okay
 Oh like what
 Yeah 
 I like that 
 I like Steinbeck a lot
 I have never read a lot of Faulkner
 Oh cool 
 I'm Doug 
 I'm from Pennsylvania
 Uh well a bunch of stuff I guess uh fair number of novels but mostly shorter ones 
 And like I don't really like the you know six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all that
 Right
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I like say uh Richard Broudigan a lot Uh
 Okay 
 uh he's dead now 
 but he was really a pretty amazing writer 
 He wrote books that were like pretty short and pretty easy to read you know like written at a third grade level or whatever
 But they were still very heavy and philosophical also very funny 
 Like He wrote TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA
 So that's anyway 
 and uh I read a lot of non fiction books too 
 Uh let's see
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Now what's that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 how crazy
 Oh sh- 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Cool 
 see I also read a lot of books about music because I'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things
 Like 
 Uh-huh 
 Like let's see 
 and even like reading some new age things things that I don't quite believe in 
 like here on my shelf I have a book called JOURNEYS OUT OF THE BODY
 It's all about how to have out of body experiences and all that
