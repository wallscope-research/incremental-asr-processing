 Okay 
 What can we do about crime 
 I don't know 
 The one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people 
 and they keep letting out people that have you know these horrible records
 So maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something 
 That's one thing I guess I could think of 
 Uh it's definitely a big concern
 I mean every day it's you know all ar- 
 we live in a little small town 
 and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time 
 And you just can't get away from it no matter where you live
 So it's pretty scary
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It's rough because 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous 
 I mean you hear about people you know six and seven times have committed burglaries 
 and they're still you know only serving six months in prison 
 So that's definitely something 
 They could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like you know from one month to ten years or something 
 That would be one thing that you know I think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties you know for certain crimes 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 And one things that they're saying now 
 are you going 
 are you a student 
 or are you in the work force 
 or 
 Oh okay 
 Because one of the things that I've heard so much about um lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much 
 And apparently especially like in date rape many of the uh you know perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up
 And they don't really 
 Wow
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 They say like only one in ten are reported 
 I believe it
 That's awful 
 So one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it 
 I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing 
 But I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing you know for people to report it
 So that's probably something else they could do
 I don't know 
 it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs you know 
 And that's like as long as 
 it almost makes me feel in a way like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have you know 
 because these kids are saying why should I go to high school 
 and so I can go out and work at Burger King you know for four dollars an hour or whatever when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs 
 So that's certainly a big problem 
 I don't know what the solution to that is 
 Having more drug treatment centers available 
 Jeez I don't know
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Because it ends up 
 even if it's just kind of like this social drug use you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin you know 
 huge amounts thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent you know on higher and higher up on drugs 
 and it's definitely got to do with crime 
 You know you hear about people selling their babies you know to get some crack
 I mean just oh 
 gosh horrible stuff like that 
 One of the things they're doing is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack
 They said uh some of the statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack 
 and their moms are crack users 
 So that's you know another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal you know for doing that to her child
 So I don't know who's the victim there 
 I mean the kids are the victim it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted 
 And it's a very complicated problem 
 I don't envy the government trying to cope with it Gosh
 Yeah 
 Well I guess that's about all I have to say
 Is there anything else you would want to
 Okay
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 It's frustrating
 Okay 
 Well thanks for talking 
 Have a good day
 Bye bye
