 Oh okay
 Uh-huh
 Do you 
 Well I work uh 
 I'm a C P A 
 and I do contract work
 and I work with another C P A who just started his own practice
 and I work with him a couple days a week
 and so when I go to his office or to other clients' offices then I'll dress up
 but otherwise it's great being at home in jeans or shorts or whatever 
 So that makes it pretty nice 
 It's kind of weird because before I used to work you know full time 
 and uh it seemed like I was wearing a suit every day just about
 Right
 Right 
 and so it's uh 
 some of my suits I haven't put on for quite a while
 So it's very nice
 Gosh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Well I imagine that where you live uh you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year
 Not really
 Oh is that right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So you all are waiting for that 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 Well down here it's sunny most of the time And uh usually warm 
 I mean we had a few cool days uh this month 
 but not anything I'm sure compared to what you've had so far
 So I mean people are still wearing shorts 
 and uh usually around Halloween it starts getting cooler 
 so you start you know breaking out a coat at that time 
 but that lasts you know for a few months 
 No
 No 
 never wore slacks
 I think it was one of those things where it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them
 It was one of those understood things that you just you know either wore you know a dress or 
 Not 
 No 
 not with what I did Uh
 Most people didn't
 Sometimes like the secretaries might
 but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much 
 And I really you know 
 there's some nice pantsuits out 
 and I wouldn't have minded you know wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold
 But uh 
 Uh-huh
 You know I think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional 
 I guess they expect women to be in skirts or dresses
 Yeah 
 That's right 
 And it's the men that make the rules 
 But no 
 we usually you know 
 skirt and blouse or suit or dress is what you see down here 
 So it's nice with me working at home because I can wear pants
 no one can see me unless I'm you know g- 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 But I'm not going to put a skirt on just for him 
 Yeah 
 I think that the main issue at home is being comfortable in your clothing 
 Right
 Yeah
