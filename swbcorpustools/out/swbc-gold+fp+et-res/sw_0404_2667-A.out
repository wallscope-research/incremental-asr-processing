 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I agree 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Ooh
 Right
 It's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise 
 I know what you mean
 Um well I try to 
 Um I started at the beginning of this year 
 I decided all right I'm going to start exercising again 
 I'm going to be real good 
 and I went through the T I fitness center and registered for the uh aerobics classes there
 And they run for two months at a time 
 And you do have to pay to take them 
 And I signed up for one that was three nights a week an hour and a half 
 so that was four and a half hours a week
 And it cost sixty dollars 
 and I thought okay that's not cheap 
 that'll encourage me to always go since I spent that much money
 And I had a friend of mine going 
 so I was real good 
 I only missed it about three times 
 And then oh March came around 
 and I signed up again 
 and I got uh caught up with a class I was taking at T I 
 and then I was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after I got out of class
 And then I went to Colorado Springs the next week to do some training at the T I up there 
 And so that was two weeks I had missed 
 and boy I tell you what I've been terrible ever since then
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 I think I've been two maybe three times the month of April 
 and this session is about to run out 
 Now I signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because I am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes 
 and some of them require me to go out of town 
 and uh that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that 
 And I've 
 lately uh there's been nights that I could have gone 
 and I've found excuses uh things like I had the flu last week 
 but I'm fine this week 
 I could have gone Monday
 I could have gone tonight 
 and I didn't
 So I'm kind of finding excuses 
 and now it's kind of like well 
 this is the last week 
 I'll just start fresh next week 
 But I better do it 
 And I think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months 
 She started taking tennis lessons 
 and so I haven't had that extra motivation of us to go 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'm the same way
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I do too
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah 
 walking is kind of boring 
 I do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood 
 and we used to try to get together 
 and I think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking 
 There's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex
 And it's not as boring if you get several people
 and you can kind of talk 
 and it makes it pass pretty quickly 
 and the aerobics isn't too boring 
 I kind of enjoy it when I'm doing it Um 
 it's a lot more fun than some other things I could do I guess
 But uh I do have to make myself go 
 and of course while I'm doing it I feel pretty good 
 and after I get finished I feel great
 I mean I can go in there 
 I can be 
 like a Friday afternoon when I'm tired it's the end of the week and I just want to go home I'll make myself go 
 and I'll have headache and everything 
 and I get out 
 I don't have a headache any more 
 I feel great 
 and I'm just 
 it's amazing how much better I feel
 And then just in general I sleep a lot better
 and I just feel much better 
 I mean I've been kind of dragging the last few weeks 
 and I know if I would just get around to exercising I'd feel better
 But my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising
 Well I'm too tired 
 or I have a headache 
 or 
 well I just got over the flu 
 and I'm still kind of draggy 
 so I better not go 
 Yeah 
 it really is
 Right
 Right
 It's just hard to make yourself go 
 And I think one thing I don't like about aerobics is that after I'm finished it's kind of late at night 
 and I've been sweaty 
 and it you know 
 I don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands
 So it kind of kills the evening for doing errands 
 So I think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better
 Of course I feel like once I've done it if I'm sweaty I might as well do an extra thirty minutes because you've already kind of shot your night
 But um so I'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Thursday now that I can just kill two nights and uh get a reasonable amount of workout in
 No 
 it's less expensive
 This one was only forty-five dollars 
 But I'm glad it's not too totally cheap because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more probably
 Since it's more expensive I think Okay you spent that much money you'd better go 
 So hopefully
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it's right there 
 and they have a really nice facility at the T I 
 They've got two different aerobics rooms 
 they have the mirrors 
 Of course sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall 
 you don't like to see how you work 
 But I guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going 
 But 
 Uh-huh
 And they have ceiling fans in the rooms 
 and it's a pretty nice setup Um 
 and of course it's real convenient because it is right there at work 
 I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere I'd never make it
 And just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to the recreation center and do it helps a lot
 Oh yeah 
 Quite a few do 
 They have probably ooh I'd say fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running 
 and they have them anywhere from six in the morning Uh 
 they have some during lunch hour that are shorter 
 and I guess guys can take advantage of that 
 For me I wouldn't have time to do an hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get dressed again
 But there's a lot more guys that do that one
 And um they have them you know in the evenings 
 they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that 
 So they have big variety 
 They even have some uh uh water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool 
 I've never done that one before 
 But 
 Uh-huh
 They've got an olympic pool and basketball courts and sand volleyball 
 They've got the full weight room and uh the locker rooms with uh a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities and hair dryers and you know everything you'd need just about
 it is a real nice facility 
 It's also got a full inside basketball court 
 and I think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things 
 But it is very nice
 I just don't take as much advantage of it as I should
 I mean I'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing 
 But 
 Yeah 
 You can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities 
 and it's about eight dollars a month
 No 
 not at all 
 Pretty cheap
 And then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership 
 but I think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced from what I've heard
 Hm
 Oh yeah 
 in fact uh the T I-er's families can come in on these things
