 All right
 Yeah 
 I exercise pretty regularly
 I lift weights quite a bit
 Um I run occasionally 
 Let's see what else do I do Play golf some 
 and I work out on a hanging bag 
 I'm brown belt in karate 
 so I keep up with that a little bit
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well that's neat 
 Yeah 
 I do walk some too 
 My wife's about five months along
 so she's been walking quite a bit 
 so that is a good exercise for that
 Uh-huh
 I do it on my own schedule
 We used to try and belong to clubs or the Y stuff like that 
 but it was so difficult to go on a regular basis to drive the distance you have to go
 Save the fees 
 we've uh just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment 
 So 
 Yeah 
 I've got a weight bench 
 and we got my wife an exercise bike 
 and I use that sometimes too
 It's a little more convenient 
 but I guess you're not as dedicated if you don't drive over to do it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think you really have to be disciplined
 uh I try to work out at least a couple of times a week 
 and I think you really have to at least twice a week just to maintain the shape that you're in
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Yeah 
 I understand 
 Did you exercise between your first child and your second
 Yeah
 Um
 Gosh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 maybe it speeded up the process and all that
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Well that's good
 No 
 I don't 
 my wife has been working with them
 Uh-huh
 At least its something you enjoy 
 I know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say Well I don't want to exercise it's too much work 
 But there's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you don't have to strain yourself or sweat or be real sore afterwards
 Yeah 
 I think we've talked about six minutes or so
 Been good talking to you as well
 Thanks
 Yours too
 Bye-bye
