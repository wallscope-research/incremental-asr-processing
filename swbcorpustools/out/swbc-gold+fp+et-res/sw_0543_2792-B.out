 Sure 
 go ahead
 Oh I like all kinds of books
 Mostly uh something I like like true life uh you know documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life
 And uh I also like romantic novels 
 uh I like READERS DIGEST believe it or not
 I usually read that from cover to cover
 I like it because there's a little bit of everything in it
 You know that kind of a thing 
 Uh as far as like real novels I haven't gotten into Shakespeare or any of that type of thing
 I wish I had in some senses 
 but I don't have time really as much as I would like to get into that kind of thing 
 How about you
 Uh-huh 
 Sure 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 Uh jeez 
 let me think 
 it 
 I tell you I haven't read a book in a long time 
 And it 
 I can't even really remember 
 Uh I think it was a romantic novel by Danielle Steel or one of those
 You know yeah 
 honestly 
 Um I don't do as much reading like I say as I would like to
 working a lot of hours at work 
 and 
 Yeah 
 and then of course we have a home 
 so it's you know 
 a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or you know that type of thing
 But see I do crafts too
 so it's hard 
 if I have a minute that's what I do
 That's the 
 and that's like myself 
 I miss it because I really find it a very relaxing hobby too
 I really do 
 and um I don't know 
 it seems like you can get lost in a book you know 
 it's like an escape for me 
 I don't know about you
 It's 
 if I'm really interested in what I'm reading I mean hours can go by 
 and I look up at the clock and say oh my word you know
 In fact I'd rather read sometimes than watch T V
 But I think you get out of the habit like you say 
 you have to like kind of set yourself 
 Yep
 No
 Yeah 
 right 
 See that's the other problem I have 
 If I start into something and I really enjoy what I'm reading then I have a terrible time getting away from it too 
 I'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning you know because I'm so engrossed in it 
 and then before you know it's time to get up and go to work 
 You know that type of thing
 That's why 
 I don't know 
 I'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that 
 Even if I'm uh doing something like an afghan if I'm close to the end sometimes I'll do the same thing
 I don't know what you would call it 
 maybe I have a problem 
 It's terrible 
 I really like books that you can get into 
 and that's that
 Oh yeah 
 you do 
 you kind of get relaxed 
 that's true
 I have a lot of craft books that I have too and uh magazines 
 I like PEOPLE you know those things that are about real people
 And um I like to uh read about people you know who made a success of their lives
 Uh *[[slash error]] to give you specific titles I can't 
 *[[sd]] Like I say haven't done it in such a long time
 Um well I went to uh seminar on uh 
 it was by American business 
 and some of the people uh 
 what the heck was his name 
 I'm trying to think 
 He's one of the uh 
 Paroe 
 *[[spelling: Perot]] and um it was more like oh 
 it was tapes and things that they had about him too
 How he started out as just a salesman and now he's you know multimillionaire and that type of thing 
 and how you have to uh be aggressive and you know really want something for yourself and that type of stuff 
 It's like up to you in other words whatever happens in your life
 It's not up 
 it's not someone else 
 you have to do it
 And I find that fascinating that people you know can do that kind of thing Just make up their minds that that's it You know have this one direction
 *[[more than one utt]] Do it 
 I can't 
 I'm not that focused on something
 I'm off in all directions
 Um and I'm not uh uh a planner which I wish I was
 You know kind of off the wall 
 If someone says do you want to do this tonight uh and I got a mountain of things to do it's okay you know we do it
 I know 
 I know 
 but I wish I was more the other way
 Yeah 
 right 
 *[[listen: sarcastic or not]] I 
 that's 
 see I like it that way though 
 I don't want to change that part of me
 That's funny 
 even though I admire someone who isn't like I am you know and I wish I could be more that way 
 but 
 That's true 
 that's true 
 How many people do you supervise
 Oh that's not bad
 That's not bad at all
 Do you like your job
 oh that's important 
 Do you have a family
 Oh uh-huh
 Do you like it
 I loved Abilene too 
 That's what I liked too is the weather
 Except for tornados 
 Yes 
 they do 
 And it's so surprising how it just happens you know
 Unpredictable
 Uh no 
 Oh I've been up here about three 
 Uh we were down there uh from eighty-five to eighty-six 
 no uh 
 ei- 
 well part of eighty-four to eighty-six I should say
 Oh wow
 Oh jeez
 I know the whole situation is bad up here 
 we're having a terrible time with the recession
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 It's not good at all
 I know things are pretty booming down there 
 I heard they sold Johnson City though 
 And Colorado Springs
 Oh wow
 Amazing
 Oh well that's good 
 At least they kept the business part of it
 It's scary though I'm telling you
 I don't know 
 and well you know with the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family
 that books influence 
 do you know how to use them in your life or to influence 
 I feel like it's important for young children to read too And what you read to them 
 When my children were younger of course 
 they were all married and grown 
 and I have grandchildren now 
 they were uh 
 I I read to them a lot
 And uh I think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also
 I'm not saying they read all the right things 
 but they do read Uh where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all 
 and I think it's important
 because uh even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens I mean they don't learn anything 
 It's because they can't read
 Yeah 
 Oh it's unbelievable 
 isn't it
 Yeah
 Exactly 
 and I think that that's why reading is so important
 because uh I think even mentally when you can do some
