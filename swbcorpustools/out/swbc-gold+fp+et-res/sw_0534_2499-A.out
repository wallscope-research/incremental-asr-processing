 <> All right 
 What have you seen
 That's 
 I knew you were going to say that 
 I want to go see that
 Gosh 
 Yeah 
 I watched uh Costner <> on the Academy Awards 
 I was really happy that he got 
 I was hoping he was going to get Best Actor
 Uh but he did pretty good on that one
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I bet 
 Yeah 
 There're several of them that are out right now that I want to see 
 Uh DANCES Uh SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
 Nay 
 Nay 
 That's what people said 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well you know that's what they said about THE EXORCIST you know 
 no 
 it's terrible 
 You'll have nightmares you know 
 I watched last weekend 
 Me and my roommate 
 we laughed about it 
 Well I'll tell 
 well I guess it was because I'd read the book before I saw the movie
 And the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was
 Yeah 
 He's a very good writer 
 and he had a way of putting you in that scene you know 
 It was 
 Yeah 
 And of course I was living alone at the time 
 and it was late at night and scary and you know 
 You start hearing noises you know
 And there's rats in the attic you know
 Uh let's see 
 There was a couple of others that are out
 and I can't remember 
 Yeah 
 I didn't even like the previews on that
 No 
 I don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway
 Yeah 
 I saw the original BACK TO THE FUTURE 
 and then I know 
 I hardly ever go see a sequel
 I mean I think the only I've ever seen a sequel was TWO THOUSAND AND ONE
 Uh TWO THOUSAND AND TEN was far better
 TWO THOUSAND AND ONE was a good movie if you had read the book
 Yeah 
 No 
 nobody could figure it out 
 I mean the book was so much uh 
 there's just things 
 all you can do is put it in words 
 You can't put it in pictures
 You know a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you say what is this
 You know what's the significance of the apes you know 
 Oh the book is really good 
 I mean I keep a little library of books that I just like to read over and over again 
 and that's one of them
 it's so well written
 Oh you're right 
 I haven't 
 Huh Oh those 
 a real dog and cat
 Huh 
 Huh 
 sounds sort of like the incredible journey 
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Yeah 
 that sounds a lot like a Walt Disney film
 Sounds a lot a like a Walt Disney film
 Oh yeah 
 Not anymore 
 I mean I was raised on Walt Disney films You know
 OLD YELLER Uh BIG RED 
 Yeah 
 When I was a little kid I saw the INCREDIBLE JOURNEY on Christmas Eve 
 and it was so good that I had forgotten that it was Christmas Eve 
 I mean that's something for a kid
 And that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time I'll tell you 
 No 
 Is it
 Yeah 
 I didn't much care for the first one 
 Maybe that's 
 Well I'll have to go get that one I guess 
 Yeah 
 It's it's *[[need slash]] Yeah 
 *[[b]] I get so tired of you know these you know sequels 
 Number nine number ten number fourteen
 Yeah you know 
 Yeah you know 
 FREDDY EATS A NUCLEAR WARHEAD you know 
 I'm just 
 I'm so sick and tired of that 
 I just can't believe it 
 It's like ROCKY films 
 I haven't seen a one 
 I can't stand Stallone
 Yeah 
 And I was afraid that RAMBO was going to do the same thing that ROCKY was going to do you know Go into fourteen hundred episodes
 Now I hardly ever watch T V 
 If I ever get the hankering to see something I've got I don't know maybe about thirty or forty movies 
 and I just 
 Yeah 
 I don't even rent them You know
 I figure if I find a movie I like I'll buy it 
 Cause I just watch them over and over again
 Yeah 
 I 
 Yeah 
 my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is uh EXCALIBUR
 I loved that film Um 
 it's just so well done
 And I lived over in England for four years
 That was the first place I ever saw it
 And it was just gosh 
 it was so good
 it was filmed in Ireland
 And they got pretty scenery in Ireland
 Yeah 
 it's nice
 And I've been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur's castle was
 Yeah 
 yeah it was unimpressive to look at 
 I mean the whole thing was about the size of a medium house 
 Yeah 
 It wasn't 
 Oh yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 There's some nice stuff over there to see
 I spent four years traveling around and didn't see you know hardly anything 
 I just 
 I need to go over there and stay about twenty years so I can just travel Go around all the places 
 Stonehenge of course you know 
 everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge
 Okay 
 big deal 
 Here's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field 
 Okay 
 It's boring 
 You know something 
 come to think of it I don't think I went to the movies one time
 I uh 
 where I lived Uh it was a little town called Newmarket About seventy miles north of London
 And there was another town called Barry Saint Edmunds about twenty miles away from us
 And they had a little uh theater company there 
 and we use to go out to that about once a week
 Yeah 
 A really nice place 
 You know amateurs but really quite good
 Uh but that was interesting 
 Course go to London quite a lot and see shows down there
 Uh but other than that I just didn't have time to go to the movies you know 
 Never sho- anyway anything that I ever wanted 
 I rented a lot of videos 
 Cause the closest movie theater was Barry Saint Edmunds 
 and who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies 
 a lot of people did
 But it would have to be a good show
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I us- 
 they have all these neat phrases You know you know you know Like critically acclaimed
 That's what they when the thing hasn't won any award
 *[[listen]] You know They can't 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 from Love Canal 
 Waterfront property here at Love Canal you know
 But you know critically acclaimed 
 Oh good grief 
 Give me a break
 That's wh- 
 I mean there's a lot of reasons why I don't go to movies
 And primarily I mean now I'm probably going to upset you 
 But people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me
