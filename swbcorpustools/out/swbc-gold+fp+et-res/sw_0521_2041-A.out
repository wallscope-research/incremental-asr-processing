 Uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 You're a student
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh I am a person who wishes I had more time to exercise 
 I don't feel like I 
 I don't very often do things for the sake of exercise 
 I don't feel well unless I am exercising 
 and I try to do things that involve exercise 
 but I very rarely do things like um 
 I've never done aerobics or any sort of structured 
 this is my exercise time
 but I do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling uh you know mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that 
 and I spend a lot of time 
 and I probably get more exercise than your average person 
 But it's not a structured sort of thing 
 and I have to admit I have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake
 and perhaps it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun or something like that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 yes 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Is that why you like aerobics classes because someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 would that we could 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right 
 You can just trust someone else to give you full exercise 
 and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Well you're talking to someone from California where it's often swimming weather 
 Uh 
 Uh-huh
 So well it's actually 
 it's interesting because there are real regional differences 
 Um in California there's uh almost an assumption um unless you're sort of clearly of an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that 
 I'm not Uh 
 there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness at least in urban California 
 And maybe not 
 I don't know about rural California too well 
 But in urban California it's just you know 
 for all I know aerobics started out here 
 I don't know where they actually started 
 but you know the craze really picked up big here 
 and before that there was the running craze 
 And they 
 California you know tends to be a bit faddish 
 but the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere 
 So there must be something to some of them 
 And uh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well there's a sense of it being a package
 I think there is a sense of you know whole 
 there's a lot of you know 
 you'll get organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever 
 And uh oh the University of California at Berkeley puts out THE WELLNESS LETTER Which uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that 
 and it doesn't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything 
 it's on fairly solid scientific ground 
 Uh it's just dispensed with these distinctions 
 It says all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they combined them all together 
 uh so it's had that orientation for quite some time 
 Um there's been some progressive medical schools out here that have taken that approach 
 And um 
 Boy 
 yeah 
 that 
 there's a 
 I can say there's a correlation but I couldn't say which caused the other 
 you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more
 Yeah 
 And 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Exactly 
 And part of it is California you know back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements 
 and some of them fizzled out 
 and some of them were disastrous 
 and others of them um had an impact on the society around here 
 And one of the ones that had an impact was uh people becoming interested in alternate practices 
 I'm not sure if it was a meditation practice or if it was you know similar to a stress management practice or alternates to uh A M A approved medicine 
 Uh you have you know major um acupuncture schools and things out here 
 and you could have them around long enough 
 and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things
 and before long you get this whole kind of Gestalt this whole package of health care and options
 uh and exercise is strongly considered one of them 
 The irony is its people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented towards doing the exercise 
 And I guess because they spend all day in back of their desks 
 The average person out on the farm now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers 
 last thing 
 Pardon me
 Oh like everything else 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 The rat race to exercise 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well I think so 
 I mean you've 
 if you look at other cultures 
 like I know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in China 
 and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all 
 But they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise 
 and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever Some sort of relaxation
 and they seem pretty you know 
 they don't have the hard body 
 They don't have that perfect look 
 and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious 
 But you know they live to a hundred and ten some you know
 And that's 
 and a lot of that is diet 
 That's true
 Yeah 
 I mean they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat Um for economical reasons not for preference 
 Um 
 Yeah 
 am I actually 
 as am I 
 Yes 
 It is in the urban areas 
 yes
 for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now
 Well most sort of modern looking restaurants will
 you can 
 I was wondering that 
 because I was actually applying for a job in Texas 
 and uh it occurred to me 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh
