 Um there was a crime here in McKinney uh a rather heinous murder 
 There was no um remorse shown by uh at least one of the perpetrators
 And yet for whatever reason um his crime was not considered a capital crime
 and quite honestly I feel very strongly that the man has no redeeming social values 
 and if and when he gets free again he will have no compunction but to I mean continue that same kind of lifestyle and perhaps do the same thing again 
 So it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever
 that's right 
 But 
 yeah 
 Did you 
 Uh-huh 
 Yes 
 but my concern is first of all that not all persons who I think should be receiving uh whatever capital uh th- uh hum punishment 
 thank you I'm sorry I just got home from work 
 and I'm just kind of spaced out a little bit
 Uh that not all of them are being convicted of it that they're not even being charged with that appropr- 
 I agree with you that a person's heart can be changed 
 but the same God that can work that miracle also established the laws that said um for certain kinds of <> sin certain kinds of uh breaking of the law there would be a capital punishment
 Right then it was uh almost immediate
 As soon as the trial was over then it was stoning
 We don't have a speedy trial 
 we don't have speedy um punishment 
 and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth 
 That's correct 
 Uh-huh 
 I tend to agree on that very strongly 
 Plus all the judicial system is overloaded with all kinds of um problems and crimes and so forth and then all of the um civil things that clog the courts
 and having sat on both uh uh criminal and a civil uh jury some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time
 Because we're suit happy
 but back to the capital situation sounds like you and I have a lot of uh common ground at least as far as capital punishment is concerned
 I would like to see or some kind of streamlining so that if a person is um convicted and sentenced to death that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with
 and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family any of us the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years
 bu- 
 him could be a her
 But 
 Um
 That's sad
 Yeah
 However certain uh very liberal minded groups who do not um subscribe to the same ethical system that you and I do such as the uh civil liberties unions and so forth will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath Which is most unfortunate because we all lose out when people go so far out to the extreme on either side
 Because too often they're can be extremism that hurts from any direction regardless of whatever you're arguing or concerned about
 Yeah
