 Do you play
 Oh yeah 
 *[[Is that really a question mark on what appears to be an answer]] Well I'm into it Uh
 Is anybody
 Really 
 Oh wow
 Right 
 Super 
 Yeah 
 that's kind of the way I did it too actually/
 I played uh just a tiny bit when I was real young 
 and then uh I got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still and then quit for awhile 
 and recently I picked it up like you say about a couple of years ago 
 and uh I've been playing you know off and on when I can
 Up in Minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course 
 but I actually live in Florida 
 so uh uh I'll be going back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly
 I was going to say 
 Yeah 
 that's true all too many times
 Fortunately uh down where I live in Florida there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look
 Uh one of them is the University of Florida golf course which is open to the public 
 and that's pretty good
 Yeah
 Can you get like a student discount type of thing 
 or 
 Yeah 
 what are green fees run there
 Okay 
 That's 
 yeah 
 that's about the same I guess as it is in Florida/
 But 
 Really 
 Oh that's super
 Yeah 
 uh-huh 
 Well that's the way to do it though
 That's the way to get in some good practice without having to pay for it all the time 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 They need to get a new photography method
 Because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball that's a little difficult/
 I mean it they do a generally okay job 
 but like you said it's kind of boring actually 
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 I bet that would be 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I've never been to a tournament 
 Uh you know looking at it on T V you're thinking man what a boring thing you know 
 But uh that's wild though 
 I'll have to see if I can't get a chance to go
 Right
 Yeah 
 I can imagine 
 What do you do for a living
 Oh you are
 uh which university
 Okay 
 All right great 
 What are you going into
 Okay 
 Definitely not golf right 
 Yeah 
 If you're good you can really rake in the bucks
 Wh- 
 what was that movie that they had out 
 Th- 
 there was a movie about a professional golfer 
 and I can't remember 
 It was on network T V a couple of times
 Yeah
 That's right 
 Yeah 
 that's a good thing
 But uh yeah 
 I guess when I get back I'm going to school in Florida actually 
 Uh and fortunately I've been able to play some golf on a student budget which is real helpful you know 
 But it's unfortunate you know 
 You hear about Japan I guess you know it's like two hundred fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just like to practice even 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I guess they have those uh driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of the other 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I played uh uh eighteen holes with some Japanese guys in Gainesville as a matter of fact 
 And it was really wild 
 They were into it
 You know they kicked our butt all the way to
