 Okay 
 well you 
 Um we got two cats
 Yeah 
 and uh um 
 yeah 
 you know my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my Mom developed an allergies
 so I mean I'm used to having cats around 
 I like them
 Oh see uh I'm not a dog person at all 
 Yeah 
 probably 
 I was allergic to dogs when I was a kid in fact 
 I may still be 
 um we 
 That um 
 I wonder sometimes 
 Um but um we house sat for um um my wife's boss a couple weeks ago 
 and um uh he has a dog and everything 
 you know we were sitting the dog and everything 
 and uh I felt like just miserable all weekend 
 and it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday 
 it was like hey maybe you're still allergic to the dog 
 It was like oh that could be it
 Yeah
 Well dogs are real high maintenances 
 you got to take them for walks 
 and you've got to pay a lot you know 
 you need to pay attention to cats and everything 
 but it's not quite the same thing
 Um and um um you know it's just nice that you know cats yeah you don't have to let them outside you know 
 all cats are indoor cats
 so you know you're not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood 
 and you know they make their mess in the cat pan which is 
 yeah 
 you know it's a pain to clean 
 but you know we used to 
 I mean they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans 
 They didn't 
 Well you know when I was growing up I had a clean the cat pan all the time 
 and I hated it because I had to carry everything upstairs you know and use this thing to you know take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything 
 it was really terrible 
 But now you get these liners that is garbage bags you know 
 and you you know the 
 Yeah 
 the cats do it in there 
 you pull it and take it out and throw it away 
 and that's it 
 Uh-huh
 Same idea 
 Everyday
 Oh okay 
 I see
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So you don't have anything right now
 Oh except the kid 
 huh that's 
 Uh I don't know because the cats pretty much um 
 yeah 
 we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out
 and um uh it's not a big deal really 
 I mean they're happier when we're around 
 but you know they're pretty much okay by themselves 
 um and you know we couldn't do that with a dog
 Well That's um pampering the petals 
 Uh-huh
 But they're not that much fun you know 
 you can't take them for a walk 
 you can't you know 
 they can't fetch you know
 they can't do anything 
 so I've never 
 I think we had fish when I was a kid 
 but I don't 
 Oh
 Oh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 No 
 it's like 
 I don't know 
 I just never understood what the attraction 
 I mean you know they're pretty and everything 
 but I've just never [ s- + seen [ the attraction of having fish 
 It's not as much fun
 an eel
 Oh now we really get sick 
 Yeah
 Like I remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha and uh you know used to drop mice in 
 these aren't cats you know
 this is gross
 Yep
 Yeah 
 well 
 Yeah 
 well a cat will do the same trick 
 I had a friend in college who um had a pet rat for a while
 Um I forget how she got it 
 but um it was the same kind of a deal 
 I think she got it 
 I think she was a psych major 
 and she got it from the psych department
 Whoops 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 I mean you know if you get them young and everything before they go kind of nuts 
 so 
 Yeah 
 rats are not my favorite animals in the world 
 but I could see getting one from birth and everything
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I have friends with hamsters and gerbils 
 and they tell me the same thing
 I just 
 again it gets into vivant much fun you know what I guess they can be 
 I 
 Okay
 Right
 Oh people 
 I don't oh 
 plus I mean the pooper scooper one New York 
 so you know 
 Yeah uh 
 I was living in northern Jersey when that law came through remember hearing all about it
 we were wondering if uh they had any special law for the horses in Central Park
 Of course not
 Hit the bags
 Oh God Haven't been up there 
 last time I was there was fall so probably wasn't that bad 
 Not this past fall 
 but I mean fall a few years 
 I mean yeah it was almost like October of eighty-five
 I think was the last time I was up there and at Center Park
 Um I had a friend who went to Colombia 
 and I used to go up and visit her
 Um so 
 No 
 they're just mutts
 yeah 
 my wife got them from uh um friend of hers at work and everything you know you know as kittens
 and I mean this was before we even met 
 Um she's had them for a couple years 
 And um you know they're really cute 
 they're sisters
 one of them is a lot bigger than the other one 
 and she pushes the other one away from the food 
 Apparently I don't know all the details 
 but they were born around Christmas because one of them is named Tinsel 
 and the other one is named Holly
 You know the scr- 
 yeah both females they're both spayed um or whatever it is neutered you know um 
 and they're both declawed at least on the front claws
