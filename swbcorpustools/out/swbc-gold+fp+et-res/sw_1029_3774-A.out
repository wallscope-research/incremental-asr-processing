 So I've been concerned about crime lately
 Uh it's really scary to listen to the news every night and to hear about all the problems 
 I wondered if you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 No um 
 Well when we moved in there wasn't any outside lights 
 and so we've been trying to install some uh outside lights 
 and we put up a fence in the backyard 
 Mostly you know not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in but that our children would be safe playing in the yard You know
 And I guess most of the crime that I'm concerned about generally is against my kids 
 It's scary to send them off down the street a few houses *[[should this end the slash unit]] To let them go play with someone because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything 
 and so I have to spend a good deal of time watching them walk down the street and say call me before you leave and come back 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh no That's a good thought
 Well we've been real lucky that 
 I don't believe there's been you know much trouble in our neighborhood 
 but it does seem that there is a lot more here in Plano of uh just bored teenagers 
 Vandalism
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and they don't uh 
 I know my sister-in-law who lives in our neighborhood they've had their 
 they parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and a few things like that 
 and course you know 
 I don't know 
 I'm getting scared for kids to get older 
 because you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know or is it just random crime 
 but uh we've been real lucky that no one in my family anywhere that they live has been a victim of you know a serious crime
 But uh it's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe 
 But I guess I take uh little bit of uh safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are like drug related or uh things that 
 places usually that I wouldn't be going And things I usually wouldn't be involved in 
 And uh there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to 
 but it is scary
 Were you raised in this area
 Uh-huh
 So has it been getting worse that you noticed or about the same 
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 Take a lot of chances 
 Well I noticed uh that uh when 
 we moved here from Houston not too long ago
 so of course we were interested in schools
 uh but the schools in Houston all have big tall fences around them 
 and they're not really very safe
 and so it's been interesting to come to the Plano area where the schools don't have fences at all around them 
 and it's just a whole different idea that at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school
 And in Houston there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school
 And so that's been something that's been good you know in this area that you feel like uh you know there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today
 And I guess 
 I don't know how people live with that every day
 Pretty scary
 But anyway well I guess I won't take up more of your ti-
