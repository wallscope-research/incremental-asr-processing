 What kind of music do you like
 Uh-huh
 Do you like like rock and those kind of things punk even
 I don't think they have a whole lot to say even 
 Yeah 
 I guess
 Uh-huh
 Do you like rap
 Yeah
 that kind I kind of like
 Some of it is kind of pointless 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 I guess I don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times 
 Um I'm with you though 
 I like classical
 um I don't like to listen to it all the time but um some of the time anyway 
 I like easy listening just kind of you know 
 I guess I don't care much for rock and roll any more 
 I used to like it all right 
 but I don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason 
 Um let's see 
 Country western uh I'm not quite as big on that 
 Some of it's okay uh
 yeah 
 Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess 
 so 
 Yeah
 a lot of them sound uh really similar 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Um
 Well that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes too I guess 
 They don't really 
 has kind of the same sound over and over 
 and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are
 you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them too
 Yeah
 Yeah
 earlier things
