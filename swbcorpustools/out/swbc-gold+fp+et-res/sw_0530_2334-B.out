 Well like I told you before 
 And you're talking about credit cards
 We put ours up 
 I mean I had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up
 Well you should try it
 Yeah
 You lost your business
 Oh gol 
 What a nightmare 
 Well you weren't charging gold and silver were you 
 You can't do that can you
 Oh you can
 Oh that's a nightmare 
 Uh-huh
 Well I remember before I got married 
 you know when you graduate from college they'll send you all those credit card applications you know 
 of course you fill them all out because you're honored
 And uh I had stuff for like Sanger Harris 
 and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars 
 and I thought Well that's okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month
 Right
 I wasn't thinking a thing about it
 Yeah 
 I was just stupid 
 and every time they had a sale there I was
 Because you know get such good bargains
 And I don't know
 Oh yeah 
 we've been getting those
 I went back to school and got my Master's 
 and they started sending those things to me again
 Yeah 
 they did
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Um
 Turned out they weren't cheeky
 So what is it now
 What do you mean fifty-five 
 You mean fifty-five dollars
 But then what's the interest
 And interest is like eighteen or something
 Yeah 
 Well credit cards
 You know my parents don't hardly use them
 I've got all my gas cards because I don't want to carry money around
 I'll do that
 Now Impact is kind of bad too though
 You know Especially if you forget to record those little suckers
 Uh-huh
 Well and you're tempted if you've got cash a little bit of cash and you don't have enough for the purchase right
 Of course you got to charge it and keep your cash
 <> What are you saying <> 
 Oh my husband says I might buy it 
 but I don't really usually consider that an option
 Maybe that's how we got in trouble
 Yeah 
 but it's hard isn't it
 Well it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic 
 With cash 
 Do you work with T I 
 No 
 Yeah 
 you could have got a discount couldn't you
 But there's always a sale
 Yeah
 What is that thing I saw 
 Circuit World or something 
 Circuit City 
 Have you been in there
 Oh it's national
 I think I've seen two around Dallas
 Well what else 
 Yeah

 Uh-huh
 So
 So Okay

 Who do you work for

 We were talking about that just today
 We could be just lifelong students
 Where are you going to school

 So what are you getting your degree in
 And what do you do with it
