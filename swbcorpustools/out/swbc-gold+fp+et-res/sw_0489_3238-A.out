 Hello
 Hi
 My name's Gail 
 I'm calling from Texas
 Oh what a deal
 Took long enough to find you
 Yeah 
 seems like they take forever any more 
 um so did you hear what the topic was
 did she tell you 
 okay
 Great 
 well if you're ready then uh I'll just go ahead and start
 Okay 
 hold on 
 Okay 
 well I guess we're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women
 Seems like um to me everything is just changing so much that it's almost like um you can't keep up with things any more 
 and everyone's striving so much to make it equal between men and women 
 I personally I'm a stay home mom 
 and I like it the way it used to be
 Are you
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 how many kids do you have
 Two
 Are they young 
 or 
 Five and two 
 I have two 
 and mine are two and nine months 
 so um being home is real 
 I just am fortunate because I don't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home 
 and uh it's just weird that I was just talking to somebody this morning who's a working mom 
 and you know these people have secretaries and these high power jobs 
 and it just seems like um 
 she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care 
 and uh I just don't agree with that 
 I think it should be that people should get back to staying home and being more family oriented than not 
 You know it seems like everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing that there's no time for this and that and the other 
 and I hope it just doesn't get to where you know there's more and more women going into the work force
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well I find that whenever I'm in a group of people and we're discussing things 
 like just over the weekend I visited my family and some cousins I hadn't seen in a long time 
 and everyone's all interested in what everybody's doing 
 and uh you know well I had my baby with me 
 and I found that all I talked about was my baby which was fine with me 
 but it's like you know here these people are 
 they're going to school getting degrees making all this money 
 and you know they kind of looked at me like I was from the dark ages you know because I didn't have really all that much to talk about uh where career and things like that were concerned 
 and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while in social situations sometimes 
 which is too bad because you know obviously I don't get paid for my job 
 but I should get paid at least double what my husband makes working in an office for staying home
 that's what I figure 
 I'm worth a lot just for what I do every day 
 but you know I don't know 
 this is kind of a um 
 at least here I've noticed 
 I'm not from here 
 I'm from Colorado 
 but I've really noticed that there are uh a lot more people that are more comfortable at least with some women being home at least in the circles I've travelled and in the church that I go to you know 
 that 
 men don't treat you like you don't know anything generally speaking
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I can see where that would definitely hinder the problem 
 definitely 
 Well
