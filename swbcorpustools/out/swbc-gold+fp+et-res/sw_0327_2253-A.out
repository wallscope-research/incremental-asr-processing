 Yeah 
 the question was uh what kind of books do you read for entertainment uh uh I guess
 Okay 
 With two little kids I can understand that
 Oh 
 uh what kind of 
 Huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 By uh somebody who was there 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well any of the guys that were ground 
 yes 
 Yeah 
 I can imagine
 Well I tell you what 
 I'm a kind of uh a history nut 
 I'm trying to think back now 
 I read an awful lot of uh periodicals and uh you know almost what you call reference books
 And uh uh I'm embarrassed to say the last you know honest to gosh cover to cover book that I read I cannot right offhand I tried to read uh one of the Michener uh LONE STAR or the TEXAS HISTORY BOOK
 Oh well I've had similar problems 
 It does tend to 
 Yeah as a matter of fact 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 <> Uh-huh
 BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 There was a lot more to it than that weren't there
 Yeah 
 well it was a political move
 It was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because you know uh if you read it it only emancipated those who were in areas uh in rebellion against the United States 
 All the other areas which I think at that time would have included West Virginia and oh may have been Kentucky a few states you know that were not part of the South but still had slaves
 They didn't emancipate them
 Uh-huh
 I've got the same problem 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Mayb- 
 isn't much there was there
 Right
 They supplied some uh you know 
 they were some groups of it the Vicksburg 
 if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg the battleground at Vicksburg uh there's an area there was uh some Texas uh groups 
 and they had an interesting time there
 And down there at Sabine Pass uh I can't think of the guy's name 
 but uh you know just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story
 That could be it 
 And then the last Civil War battle was fought at Val Verde you know 
 over there on the Texas border you had a lot of groups heading for Mexico 
 and they were cut off at the pass more or less at Eagle Pass 
 And they didn't get across the river there 
 so they're the last 
 and that was actually after the war was over 
 but it was the last organized battle between the two units was in Texas 
 so 
 Yeah 
 Texas participation in the Civil War was uh minor at uh 
 it's been 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well my wife's from Galveston 
 so 
 Yeah 
 Well I'm from New Mexico 
 so you know I was 
 Uh-huh
 <> Huh
 It sounds like Iowa or something
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 on 
 yeah
 Oh well my sister's living in Illinois right now 
 so 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I've always kind of enjoyed it 
 I used to read a lot more than I do now
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 <> Uh-huh
 I just turned around and looked at my uh bookcase up here 
 and I see ARMAGEDDON up there 
 And uh the SHADOW OF BLOOMING GROVE and TWO THOUSAND AND TEN and GRANT TAKES COMMAND and THE WAR IN THE YEAR oh SPACE that was the one I was trying to wade through was SPACE James Michener Didn't get very far on that
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it really 
 the books are kind of uh imposing to say the least
 No 
 let's see 
 here's one called GHOST TOWNS AND MINING CAMPS OF NEW MEXICO 
 now not too many people have read that one 
 I don't think
 And there's THE HISTORY OF YOAKUM COUNTY TEXAS there
 I've got uh 
 Yeah 
 yeah and I've got a HISTORY OF KINGSLEY IOWA
 Well because that's where my folks all came from
 And they had a centennial here awhile back 
 I read the GRANT TAKES COMMAND 
 that was pretty good
 That was part of that trilogy that uh Bruce Canton did
 Yeah
 Sometimes it's awful hard 
 some of those get very philosophical 
 they can be in any setting 
 they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting you know 
 the 
 Oh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 you're reading DUNE
 That was a movie too wasn't it
 Was it
 Yeah 
 I didn't see it 
 but uh 
 yeah
 Patrick Stewart was in that 
 I guess the guy that's on the new STAR TREK series was in that thing uh 
 Oh really 
 <> Uh-huh
 Couldn't 
 Yeah
 Um well some history books are pretty scary 
 but 
 yeah 
 No 
 Somebody who saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they'd ever seen 
 they didn't sleep all night
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I have 
 no uh 
 I don't have the foggiest notion what it's about 
 so 
 Okay 
 yeah 
 But 
 Uh-huh 
 that's the one
 Even better than JAWS and some of that
 Yeah
 Oh 
 a Freddy Kruger type huh
 Oh the worst kind 
 yeah
 yeah
