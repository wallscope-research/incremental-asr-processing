 All right 
 and your occupation is teaching
 Substitute teacher
 Yes 
 it is 
 Right 
 Well I was just trying to make an introduction here 
 and I haven't told you I'm going to be at a different school this year now
 I've just gotten another job at an elementary library at Barron
 Right 
 I 
 well not really 
 every day I've got to uh read to kindergartners 
 so I'm going to be down on the floor with them 
 I've got about forty kindergartners I'm going to be working with every day for uh you know a half hour 
 So I'll probably be wearing slacks as often as I do because if I'm going to be down on the floor messing with them I'm not going to wear you know nice nylons and dresses
 Right
 Well of course you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold 
 But you don't know uh I guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there
 Subtract
 Right
 I think some of the dress codes are different at different schools 
 That's one of the things I ask about you know whether she would allow slacks 
 and she said she doesn't have a problem with that 
 she just didn't like sloppy dressing
 and I said well you know that was okay 
 And I'm 
 basically you know I wear slacks year round except about once a week I try to wear a skirt 
 and in the winter you know I maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than I do in the summer And add a heavier jacket or you know wear jackets more in the winter than I do in the summer
 That's about 
 I don't really work in a profession that requires that I wear a business suit and you know look really 
 Yeah 
 Right
 And you never know that though sometimes when you're going in do you
 Right 
 right
 Right
 On what Thursday 
 Right 
 right 
 So that would kind of give you a clue I guess 
 and sometimes you get the long term stuff 
 so you're aware ahead of time of what's going on 
 That 
 so that's 
 and I don't know you know 
 I think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know 
 Are 
 they put one on the parents or the teachers and say the men have to wear ties 
 and there can be no blue jeans worn 
 and because some of the teachers I know wear uh dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease 
 and uh you know they'll wear it with a nice top 
 and uh I don't know that that looks that bad 
 But if you're going to tell the kids they have to dress up I guess you can tell the teachers that too
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 right
 Yeah 
 there's a couple teachers up there that do dress up more than others
 Right
 Right 
 Well and you always 
 course it's a standing joke you know when the men come in a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today 
 or yeah there's usually something going on that uh would uh cause that to happen
 and I don't know how a coach would feel that teaches health or you know English or whatever that they had to wear a tie 
 I 
 some of those male coaches that might really 
 Right 
 and a T-shirt
 Right 
 That I didn't ever understand 
 I mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period 
 so 
 Whether 
 Change then
 Well see that's what I would think
 That's what I would think
 Right
 Course we had one coach one period he'd teach P E and the next period Health and then a period of P E
 and that's hard
 You know so he just left warm-ups on 
 but uh no 
 I think really probably they could uh really 
 and I don't know if they make uniforms the thing for the kids 
 I guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top 
 and 
 You don't think so
 Well some of them yes they do 
 and it's not at some of the private schools 
 but even there's a couple public schools in Dallas where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers you know dress in accordance with that
 Uh-huh 
 Well I think it would make a difference at school 
 I don't think we should be spending time saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts too short 
 or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high you know 
 I mean it's a lot of trouble to take care of that 
 And of course the kids say then why bother just let me wear what I want 
 and yet we can't to that either 
 I'd like to see them go to not necessarily a uniform but saying that they've got to wear a button down shirt You know 
 that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them 
 But if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted 
 and 
 And then the girls 
 Right
 I don't 
 no 
 not in Plano
 They may get a- 
 but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational process there
 Highland Park's thinking about going that route
 So it 
 and then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do
 Yeah 
 I agree with you on
