 You know what 
 I watched a little bit uh of the Bulls game 
 and I uh had to leave 
 Uh in fact I think the Bulls were ahead uh when I left 
 Who won the game
 Is that right
 Uh-huh
 Wow don't they have the best record now
 *[[ Shouldn't the "Wow" be an independent slash unit ]] Yeah
 Wow
 they do 
 and they you know 
 I think uh by relieving some of the pressure off uh of uh uh 
 Michael Jordan really helped them out 
 You know they don't have to rely on him to score you know thirty or forty points at every game 
 so 
 Oh I know 
 I'm 
 yeah 
 [ I saw the w- + I saw uh just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors uh Dallas game
 They look good
 Yeah 
 now uh I haven't kept up with what was going on uh with the 
 Uh-huh
 Good move
 Yeah
 Uh I think Boston's in first 
 Uh you know I haven't kept up with any of the other uh teams 
 I'm so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks you know
 Oh man 
 That 
 well yeah 
 but I mean just this whole year has been just disastrous for them 
 and uh you know I think they're going for an all time record of how many you know losses in a row they can uh pull out
 It's unbelievable
 Uh 
 Well actually the Dallas area here uh pulls for Dallas 
 Uh San Antonio pulls for San Antonio 
 and Houston pulls for the Rockets
 There really 
 I mean not a whole lot You know 
 I mean you find them to be pretty loyal uh with the local teams
 Uh you know I guess it's kind of like uh there in the Bay area you know you don't find a whole lot uh of Sacramento fans
 Really isn't 
 uh-uh
 it's about the uh same distance from here to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento
 So yeah it's not really a local you know 
 Uh he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio 
 and I mean they have got a great club You know
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that always makes a big difference
 So 
 Yeah
 And you know uh you know I used to think that one player really doesn't make a club 
 but it really does you know
 You get somebody like Magic 
 and you can see the decline in that team
 Once he left you know uh it's not the same team 
 There's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for
 Oh yeah 
 Who won that Portland game
 Uh
