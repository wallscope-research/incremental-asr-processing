 I guess we're ready to talk
 Well let's talk about air pollution
 What do you think causes air pollution in Dallas 
 Or where are you from
 Maybe you're not in Dallas
 Okay Uh
 Well I have some small experience in this area 
 The brown haze that you see if you look down Central towards downtown a lot of that is uh tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some of the kind of bluish gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates 
 But uh one of the major problems that Dallas has is oxides and nitrogen 
 That's because of all the equipment that's being operated But at the same time uh because we don't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we don't get a lot of particulates 
 Now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in Dallas
 Uh power plants since 
 many of our local power plants uh are natural gas most of the time uh the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide and N O X 
 There's no particulates in natural gas of course 
 And we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products 
 We're burning fuel oil and a few other things 
 but gasoline of course now the lead's out at least theoretically uh I guess you could say we're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur 
 That's why we get that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter the sulphur yes 
 And that's uh course hydrogen sulfide which is when you burn gasoline you also produce some water vapor and that goes back in with your sulphur 
 and under the right condition you get H two S
 But anyway uh 
 Well I don't know
 Uh-huh
 Ro- 
 uh Ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is
 And when they run rich they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons 
 and that's another part of the problem 
 The gas is not being burned completely 
 But uh hopefully if we ever get our road system fixed up this will get a lot better
 Well I guess not trying to top you but I grew up in Dallas county and I can remember when they built the north part of North Central which was built after the south part of Central 
 and uh I can remember coming over the hill down there long about uh I don't know little bit north of Mockingbird on up over those hills 
 and I said I wonder if they'll ever need this road
 Course it was designed for most of us to go about forty-five miles an hour because the short on ramps and off ramps 
 but gosh 
 seems like uh those ramps might kill us yet 
 I 
 hopefully the new ones will be a lot better
 Yeah 
 Ron have you noticed when you're driving south on thirty-five I guess towards Waxahachie Hillsborough on down to Austin you hit a point down there about I think where they call Bear Creek exit on just this side of the county line 
 Right along in there somewhere suddenly the air feels cleaner 
 Have you noticed that
 Well sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing
 but uh I also travel a little bit 
 and uh I don't know it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier 
 It may be all in my mind
