 A uh Golden Retriever 
 Yeah 
 Is it really 
 We've had him for 
 let's see he just had his fourth birthday 
 Yeah 
 and we got him when he was about eight weeks old 
 and uh he's pretty okay 
 we like him
 He does 
 That's the one thing we don't like about him 
 In fact we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off
 He'd probably look pretty funny if we did that 
 actually he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything 
 and they put him on the scale 
 and he's up to ninety four now
 But he's not a real tall uh dog for a Golden Retriever 
 He's kind of stocky shorter and stockier
 But 
 He is 
 It's uh just me and my wife 
 and uh he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids
 We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten 
 Because I 
 Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids 
 How about you 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 That's probably a good idea 
 They're good though 
 Uh have you ever had a Retriever before
 Because I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs 
 They don't tend to get real jealous or territorial 
 They like to play
 Especially with the kids 
 They love to play with kids
 No 
 he's pretty much an inside dog 
 He stays in 
 we're kind of in not a real busy neighborhood but more so than I'd want him to be out too much 
 and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside
 He's really a wimp 
 And when it comes to being alone 
 uh now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants he likes that 
 but he does not like to be tied outside 
 he'll just bark and bark and bark
 No 
 he's uh taken to the training pretty well 
 and uh he knows where our yard is 
 and we have a pretty small yard 
 but he seems to know the boundaries
 And he usually is good about staying within them 
 although our next door neighbors have a dog too 
 and uh she is good friends with my dog
 And so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff 
 but he's pretty good 
 He stays out of the street 
 and uh if I catch him I call him 
 and he comes back 
 So he's pretty good about taking to commands and things
 No 
 we never did
 I trained him on my own 
 and uh this is the first dog I've had all my own as an adult
 or we've had dogs when I was a kid 
 but this is the first one that I uh took in 
 so I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get it all right the first time 
 but uh he seems to have picked it up pretty well 
 I never really to hit him or anything 
 Just you know firm tone of voice and those sorts of things 
 I see other people out there 
 and they hit their dogs and try to 
 and those horrible collars that they put on them with invisible fencing 
 least I 
 Invisible fencing 
 have you heard of that 
 uh it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little uh transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter 
 and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it 
 and if they get too close to that perimeter it zaps them 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 well a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog 
 and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to 
 so he held on to the collar 
 and he walked out to the perimeter 
 He said it was a good jolt
 Yeah 
 and so I don't take too well to those sorts of training techniques 
 I don't think they're always necessary 
 If you put enough patience into 
 Uh-huh 
 uh is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat 
 Somebody just told me that 
 because of the leukemia 
 Wow 
 Quite a difference 
 uh what kind of climate do you have 
 Oh
