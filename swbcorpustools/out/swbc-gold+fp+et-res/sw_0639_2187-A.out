 okay 
 Um yeah 
 that's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe 
 well it says what you would have for a dinner party 
 Um this is strange because I pressed one and I thought it said begin
 Okay 
 maybe we're all set 
 Okay 
 we'll talk for five minutes 
 they interrupt at the end 
 Um yeah 
 it says what you would have for a dinner party 
 I just happen to plan one out for Saturday 
 I'll tell you what I'm going to have Um if I can find it 
 Well I have this new fondue pot 
 and I was going to do basic cheese fondue 
 and I have two different kinds of breads and some ham 
 and I was going to try something weird which you know 
 when you have fish au gratin 
 I was going to make some uh like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue 
 I don't know if it will come out
 Yeah 
 the cheese fondue I make 
 some people like swiss um 
 I prefer cheddar 
 And I'll mix 
 I won't have a sharp cheddar because for fondue I think it should be a little calmer than real sharp cheddar
 And then I was going to make other things like potato skins
 see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff 
 And um I was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a vegetable
 Oh yeah 
 it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party
 Yeah 
 instead of something greasy or 
 my uh girlfriend's do catering 
 and always about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray 
 I think they try and suggest it
 What I've been doing when I get invited someplace and bring something I make uh food kabobs 
 You take little toothpicks and cut up uh pineapple and strawberry and even banana if you can do it just before you leave
 It stays nice and fresh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I like those 
 Um they made a couple of those uh 
 they made one for my uh bridal shower 
 and I was pretty pleased 
 I never made one for myself though 
 But they look easy enough to make 
 it's not 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you get probably pretty sticky after you get done
 Then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because you know when you scrape it it makes the water
 Yeah 
 um something I do is a fruit 
 I'll um make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them 
 Yeah 
 I have two nieces 
 and they go melt some chocolate chips 
 Go buy me some strawberries
 Yeah 
 you know if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better 
 but if you get a sour strawberry 
 Huh Yeah 
 no 
 um the strawberries are coming in season now from 
 they're coming up from Florida of course 
 I live in Vermont 
 But they're really reasonably priced 
 they're coming up from Florida 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 uh actually I think they get um some of them from South America
 Yep 
 they 
 a lot um of a um winter produce comes from South America
 Of course their seasons are switched
 So um do you want to discuss the recipe
 I have a recipe if you want 
 Um it filled 
 a lot of people try to stay away from this 
 but I make my own homemade pudding just because I don't like box pudding
 Yeah 
 and it if you um well 
 first of all I take about a quarter and a half of milk 
 and I put it in a two quart saucepan 
 and you put it on a really low heat
 And you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it ends up burning 
 I mean no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot
 I don't let that worry me 
 And I get the milk lukewarm 
 and then I pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it 
 and I have this thing 
 it's called the slender blender 
 uh it makes uh a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough 
 It's uh I don't know 
 they're called moo goo leaves or something 
 they're sl- 
 Yeah 
 They're real neat
 I think they're real reasonably priced 
 some of them they used to be a hundred dollars 
 and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert 
 but I didn't get that one 
 I got the Black and Decker kind 
 But uh it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord 
 and you beat this cornstarch right into the milk you know 
 and it does an excellent job 
 or just hand beat it 
 I guess you could use a hand mixer 
 but I don't think it gets it good enough
 And then before the milk gets too hot um I add two beaten eggs and I really mix them in good And then about a half a cup of sugar 
 and I let it pretty much 
 I beat it like every minute for about ten seconds 
 and it starts thickening 
 when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little I don't know 
 it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch
 and you just keep beating it in 
 And it's the 
 the trick is to have this blender 
 so if you were 
 you'd have to probably almost go out 
 and someone who's just going to make it first time it's 
 you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders
 And then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate 
 or after it's thickened I cook it for a good 
 once it starts boiling I cook it for a good seven to ten minutes 
 and then you can make chocolate 
 or you can take it off and let it cool 
 you put um really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter 
 and that makes french vanilla um custard 
 Yeah
 A chocolate powder
 Yeah 
 that cocoa yeah the unsweetened 
 It comes in like a real dark can
 our mothers used to use it 
 And then 
 Yeah 
 we all used to 
 yeah 
 it's the unsweetened kind 
 it's not like Nestles Quik
 I suppose you could use that 
 I- 
 Yeah 
 but um 
 Well I used to make the regular pudding the chocolate and put it in the pie shell 
 and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day where you cut the pie it would soak into the pie shell 
 and it was like red 
 and I'm like oh 
 this is kind of groedy 
 Um actually I found it in one of my mother's um homemade cookbooks 
 I mean something she had collected out of WOMAN'S DAY or something
 So 
 I think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or a regular beater 
 but um 
 Yeah 
 but I still think a beater would do it good enough um 
 the trick is to get the cornstarch
 um yeah 
 right in the lukewarm milk 
 Sometimes I put the cornstarch in a separate bowl 
 and I would put it in the sink 
 and I'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good 
 It seems to be better than putting the cornstarch into the liquid 
 once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top
 Yeah 
 And I'll do this uh 
 sometimes I'll put my after I pour that back into my saucepan 
 I'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg 
 So 
 Yep 
 And then you know if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to The cocoa even seems to thicken it even more
 Because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the 
 sometimes the cocoa is 
 like my husband really likes it thick 
 he says I can stick the spoon right in this
 Because I'm always worrying it won't firm up because when you take it out of the saucepan it's like boy I hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick you know 
 when you cook a package it's a little less 
 but I put it in a nice glass bowl 
 and um some people don't like that film on the pudding 
 so you can put uh Saran Wrap over the top
 And then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap 
 so when you pull the Saran Wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap 
 and I might put it back on 
 But um 
 Yeah 
 well when it starts steaming a lot uh I definitely yeah put it in the refrigerator
 but um I 
 my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard
 That's 
 yeah
 so that's why I do that
 So well I don't know 
 that's my great hard recipe
