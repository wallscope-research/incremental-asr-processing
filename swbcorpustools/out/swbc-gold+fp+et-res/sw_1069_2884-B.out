 Well we don't actually have a budget per se 
 What we do is uh maintain a normal checkbook You know like everyone in the world does I guess 
 and occasionally it actually balances 
 And um um we have a U S Air and Visa card
 every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage
 It's a real good deal actually if you charge a lot 
 So what my wife and I have taken to doing is charging everything in sight 
 Anything we buy we charge including groceries and so forth
 So what we'll do is 
 Right 
 We actually maintain a 
 we have a checking account that we treat like a savings 
 scratch that 
 we have a savings account that we treat like a checking account
 And so what we do is anytime we do or make or charge something we write it out as if we wrote a check
 And then at the end of the month all the money to covered already 
 So we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything
 It keeps us hopping
 Huh-uh 
 Well you know you know you know what's always good is sort of a for savings where they just take money out of you're pay
 We did that for awhile where um 
 we actually still do it with my wife's salary where we have a third account even a savings account in an entirely different bank where what we do is take money out of her paycheck every week 
 I'm a graduate student
 Oh really 
 In what field
 Oh okay 
 I'm in uh psycholinguistics actually
 Um but my wife has a real job
 Yeah 
 What we do is we take money out of her paycheck each week
 And it goes directly to another account at an entirely different bank that we don't have access to so easily 
 and it goes there 
 and it stays there 
 and it builds up until we need it for something
 Oh
 Gee
 Right
 God
 I got lucky 
 My wife apparently is not a 
 she likes to spend 
 but she's pretty good about things
 Wow
 That was great With the money savings there That's good 
 Right 
 Well I guess we all have those feelings
 I go to uh 
 I pay what I think is a lot of money to go to a karate class you know
 Right 
 Exactly 
 but that to her is sort of like a waste
 But she does her nails 
 So 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Yeah 
 Good old Ivory 
 Um well it's for your benefit though right
 so that's helpful
 Yeah 
 Now do you still own a house 
 You said you owned one
 That's great
 Right 
 Oh wow 
 that's the killer two apartments 
 Wow
 Eventually right 
 I mean you're not going to 
 Right 
 Have you been married for long
 Oh wow 
 So you guys really are newlyweds
 Oh wow 
 Yeah
 I actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes Because you know um I sort of feel guilty you know given that she makes twice as much as I do
 So I say if she wants to go out and buy something I never argue with her because she's real good at you know sort of 
 Yeah 
 Had some money in her pocket yeah
 That's right 
 I do recommend the for savings bit 
 uh they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt
 You know you don't even think about it if it's gone
 Yeah 
 so uh until you really need it 
 and then you realize you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else
 Right 
 Yeah 
 that's been our godsend you know
 We've had some sort of major emergencies come up you know where 
 we also own our own house
 um we had an ice storm up here recently where I mean it was horrible 
 I mean half the city owned trees 
 One-third of all vegetation in this county is just wiped out
 Yeah
 Exactly
 We had to our backyard tremendous willow tree that just fortunately 
 but it cost us you know a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down I mean just to take off what was broken 
 Plus we went with a friend 
 and they said you know 
 and then the whole ice storm cost us quite a bit of money even though insurance picked up some of it still not all of it 
 They don't get you know 
 and that 
 plus 
 and then we had a car expense like that same week 
 One of the cars died you know 
 All of this adds up 
 and that for savings really comes in handy
 Right
