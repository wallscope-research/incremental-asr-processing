 Okay um 
 yeah 
 one year public service for everybody 
 that was it right 
 Em- 
 I don't know 
 I've been sitting here thinking 
 yeah 
 because it you know took a couple tries before I found somebody 
 Well you know like I'm not really sure what I think about this 
 Um uh I mean the first thing is uh if it's going to be mandatory it's got to be mandatory 
 I mean everybody not just like you know poor people and all that you know But you know senators' sons and all that stuff too 
 I mean everybody's got to do it 
 Um I don't know 
 it'd probably be good 
 I just don't know if you know I was eighteen or whatever I'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 It is uh
 Uh-huh
 Well I guess it would still depend on how 
 I mean if you're talking about something that's like you know one year full time you know this is what you do you know 
 You're going to go and fill pot holes you know and you know all that stuff 
 I mean you know I don't know 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well 
 and also you know you feel more like you know you're actually part of the community if you've done something in it
 Uh-huh
 Uh definitely
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh that would be a nightmare 
 And I mean just getting it going
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh <> 
 Yeah
 no 
 not yet 
 In about six months we will 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 They have that here Um
 they've got um in most of the states around here I think uh 
 You know down in North Carolina there was a big controversy for a while because uh the local chapter of the K K K wanted uh uh to participate in it 
 [ and uh there was a + *[[ end of slash unit ]] Yeah 
 *[[ should be indepedent slash unit ]] Well uh it was interesting because that's an interesting question you know
 Should these people be allowed to or not 
 I think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed 
 Yeah 
 I think Virginia's got it 
 and I know Maryland does 
 and we went to Indianapolis last weekend and back 
 And um I'm pretty sure I saw yeah stuff in Ohio and Indiana about it and maybe Pennsylvania 
 I don't remember for sure now
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 but then they lost too much business 
 Uh-huh 
 Well the thing about that is though it's got a 
 I mean because I mean it was big you remember like in the early seventies and all that 
 you know and then it kind of just went out of vogue 
 And I'm worried that you know the same thing will happen 
 It's like you know environmentalism was really big for a couple of years 
 and then people like well you know 
 I'd rather spend you know fifty cents less on such and such you know 
 and even if it's not environmentally safe who cares you know
 Yeah
 Well yeah uh 
 Well uh wouldn't 
 it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may make some people realize that hey you know this stuff runs out
 Of course that's probably blasphemy for you to say uh coming from where you are in Texas
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Right 
 Well my dad's in the solar energy business 
 so uh You know we're acutely aware of a lot of this 
 But you know on the other hand he voted for George Bush 
 so um you know I wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well the thing with Bush
