 Steve this is 
 like I mentioned Brian and I guess we're going to want to be talking about child care 
 Uh do you have any experience in uh finding child care
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well uh we're kind of lucky 
 uh I'm working 
 My wife isn't working 
 and she is taking care of the kids also 
 and so we haven't had to look for child care either which has been very nice 
 But I do have like you mentioned a lot of friends a lot of uh co-workers and associates that are looking for child care 
 and some of the things that they're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care Uh what kind of you know uh guidance counselor to student or you know uh adult to child relationship 
 How many 
 you know you don't want to have thirty or forty kids and only one adult 
 Then uh something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to uh accommodate or take care of the kids very well
 And uh they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time 
 So you know depends also upon the level of the child 
 We uh we uh take a very close look at finding a good preschool for our kid
 And I kind of relate that to that in making sure that the uh teachers are very well educated themselves They have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them 
 And it's very important I feel uh that the kids interact with other children also 
 it's a good way to develop relationships with other kids their age and uh get to know and work with kids 
 So I don't know I guess we're kind of in the same boat 
 We haven't had to look very carefully for child care
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh <>
 Uh-huh <>
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right 
 I think it's uh important Like you mentioned that's a good idea on the uh parent co-op because uh I'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids 
 and I don't want to just take them to somebody I pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere 
 I want to trust the people 
 And uh you know you hear on the T V and you read the newspaper quite often of people that you know don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of 
 And hope to never get into that situation where we have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children 
 And hope that we can stay in this situation for awhile 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 that's true
 Well Steven it's been
