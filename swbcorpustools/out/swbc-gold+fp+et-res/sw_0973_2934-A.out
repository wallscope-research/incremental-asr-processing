 Well the last three days it's been pretty rainy 
 We went to the beach
 and uh it started uh let's see around four o'clock
 and uh it had thunder and lightning 
 and then you know it was just overcast and rainy for uh the next two or three days straight 
 How about yours
 Uh-huh
 You're from Virginia
 Oh from Texas
 I heard they had some flooding down there
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Well the last couple of years um we're over as far as our rainfall goes 
 Before that it was really dry 
 and uh everybody was you know talking about rationing water and doing this and doing that 
 Not really rationing water but just cutting down
 And uh it seems like uh you know the weather pattern is just shifting and uh that uh jet stream is moving uh into our area North Carolina and across 
 but it's uh changing latitude
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 It's finally cleared up 
 It's just now still a little overcast 
 but the sun has finally started popping out
 Oh yeah 
 well right now as a matter of fact I'm fixing to go play tennis 
 um I'd say it's at least seventy-nine eighty well about seventy-eight seventy-nine degrees
 Um actually uh the wind normally blows let's see let me think about this south southwest
 Yeah 
 uh but actually I guess our weather pattern uh blows north east 
 yeah
 you're right 
 it blows north east
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 how far are you from Houston
 Oh I see 
 so you don't get anything off the Gulf uh immediately from the ocean
 Uh-huh
 Um Well we've had some you know pretty rough winds 
 Oh uh Bangladesh boy they caught it bad 
 But we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes 
 I know uh Hurricane Hugo 
 you probably heard about that
 Uh last year
 Yeah 
 and they're still uh rebuilding from that storm 
 and so the beaches here just get really beat up <> 
 and it usually comes this way 
 It comes up from uh Miami uh down or you know around the Bahamas 
 and it usually travels uh northwest 
 and uh it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits
 Um let's see 
 two years ago we had one 
 as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house
 And um it was real odd 
 The barometric pressure drops during a tornado 
 and our uh fire alarm went off
 So of course that woke everybody up 
 and we knew what was going on to uh you know go downstairs or go into the bathroom and uh take cover
 But uh we get uh 
 yeah 
 uh we get our share of tornados
 No 
 huh-uh
 We're about two hours from the beach
 So uh you know uh barometric pressure I believe is higher in the mountains 
 and we catch you know a few winds coming off of them I think
 But uh let's see 
 you all just had a tornado uh over close to Oklahoma and Texas
 Uh-huh
 Oh gosh
 Oh did it
 Um
 Um Boy I would have like to have heard that 
 That would have been something
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I used to live in Amarillo originally
 So I'm 
 Oh yeah 
 especially in Borger we use to sit out on our back uh picnic table and watch them come out of the sky through the funnel clouds
 and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground 
 But otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them go in and out of those clouds
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you'd be amazed at how clear the sky was 
 but the clouds are just really uh uh rolling kind of just real pillowy I guess
 Oh well I was in that uh big tornado went through Wichita Falls
 And uh the sky 
 I mean we were right in the middle of it when I mean signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us
 And a whole roof of a restaurant came off 
 And uh it was uh a real eerie blue-green color
 And the lightning was almost continuous just uh you know as if you put your hand on one of those electric uh things that causes lightning
 Uh I think it was called the storm
 But um the whole sky was full of that eerie blue-green uh lightning
 Um
 Uh-huh 
 We haven't got that much rain 
 but uh when it rains it's been downpouring
 You too
 Okay 
 thanks
 Bye
