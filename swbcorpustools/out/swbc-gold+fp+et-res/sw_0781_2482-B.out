 Oh how nice 
 I would love to live up there
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 That's what I heard 
 <> I've always thought about maybe transferring up there 
 and I thought if I do that I might not have a job 
 so 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I know it
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I'm sure it does 
 So you only have the stepdaughter at home
