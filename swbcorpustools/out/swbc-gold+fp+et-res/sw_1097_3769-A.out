 Okay 
 it's pressed 
 Are you still there
 Okay 
 So what's uh things that you look for when you go out to dinner
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Um that sounds pretty Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well we don't go out to dinner that much either 
 We try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or something like that 
 but I definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean you know
 Um I've been to some that's been terrible 
 You know you see cockroaches crawling around and everything you know 
 But I try to get one that's nice and clean 
 and then I like you know good food and good service
 So 
 Yeah 
 right
 Right 
 right
 So is there some nice places to go to eat in Plano
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Um
 Um that sounds beautiful
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Well This is only a little small city 
 Uh we have uh 
 excuse me I didn't think my coughing would come back 
 Anyhow we have only like one uh restaurant that's kind of nice 
 You know they have prime rib on uh weekends
 and then they have about six miles from here is called a little city called Wesley 
 and they have a Wesley Hotel there that they serve food 
 and the atmosphere there is really really nice
 So and then if we really want to you know something different we go to Modesto which is like twenty minutes away
 But uh we don't have any fast foods here in this small city 
 Do I have kids
 Well I have a son 
 but he's grown up
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 All the kids seem to love McDonald's don't they you know
 No 
 no 
 I'm sure there isn't
 Uh-huh
 I know 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well let's see what else can we talk about 
 Oh it's foggy and cold here
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 and it's 
 I came from Iowa when I was sixteen
 so I've lived out in California for a long long time
 Yeah 
 I like it real well
 We used to live in Oakland 
 so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there you know 
 but uh then I quit work and everything 
 and I bought a house 
 I had a condo in Oakland 
 so right in Chinatown so we went to lots of Chinese restaurants 
 and they were really good 
 I really miss them You know 
 Uh no 
 I really don't miss living there 
 I just like to go in there and have a nice Chinese dinner once in a while you know
 But uh as far as missing living there no
 It's close enough if I wanted to go there to San Francisco for dinner or something why you know an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and you know have dinner and then come on back 
 But uh have you ever been to California
 Oh really
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
