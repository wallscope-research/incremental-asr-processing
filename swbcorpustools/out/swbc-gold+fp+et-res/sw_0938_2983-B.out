 No 
 Actually I'm a spectator 
 and I'm a second hand spectator as a result of or my late husband's interest in golf
 Uh-huh
 I can't even play miniature golf well
 Well there are just some things that we're good at and other things that we're not 
 but I am very good at watching it on television
 And he was really uh enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments 
 He could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held and what the nature of the hole was and 
 Oh yeah 
 he was a good golfer
 and did some you know instructions at the country club for a while
 But uh golf tended to be so- 
 I am not really deeply involved in following any of the sports
 But golf was one that I developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers 
 and therefore I enjoyed following those particular players
 Uh-huh
 Well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship 
 Another part of it was I'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for 
 so you know the competitor 
 and I became involved in following his career
 And uh I know that my husband 
 Tom Kite was his fair haired boy
 And he thought he was spectacular 
 I said Whoa 
 I'm not going to stay interested in him 
 So I decided Andy Bean was good competition 
 Any time they both played why he was just real excited when Tom was you know shown on the television
 and I followed Andy Bean
 We both followed Lee Trevino into the Seniors
 He is
 He is a character not just a golfer 
 but he's quite a character
 And there are some really really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models
 And I think it's critical to have a good role model in any sports 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I myself really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf 
 You hit a little ball
 you chase it 
 you go find it 
 and then you hit it again and lose it again
 And I know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole
 but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier
 Oh I know
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 Well my husband's average ran in the mid seventies
 so he wasn't bad
 He was pretty good 
 but as far as influencing young people I think that uh that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age 
 You can't play football at fifty-five
 But it is a good healthy wholesome lifestyle uh 
 anything can be warped
 But I think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to move into maturity safely
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 That's right 
 that's right
 And a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're you know in their later years
 That's right 
 that's absolutely right 
 And it's something that 
 Yeah 
 when you're too old to do anything else go play golf 
 yeah 
 But it's also something that husband and wife can participate in
 or you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles
 You know you can go to the country club together 
 You can play with your friends 
 he can play with his friends 
 but you've both been out and exercised 
 and you have enjoyed the day
 You bet 
 you get a lot of exercise that way
 Uh-huh 
 well I'll tell you what if they're not real good golfers sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long
 Uh-huh
 Oh mine had a very short fuse 
 If he did something bad he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it
 He's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls 
 I mean just get so mad he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 well I shot in the hundreds 
 but I made this one good one 
 Uh-huh
 Well one thing that is a drawback about it I think is the cost
 Membership in the clubs is expensive 
 the equipment is very expensive 
 requires special shoes 
 requires you know special equipment 
 There's so many 
 That's right
 That's right 
 that's right
 It can get very expensive 
 and I can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro because you spend hours and hours and hours practicing
 And they don't give those sessions away
 And nor do they give uh instructions away
 As a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if I thought I'd be interested in golf 
 I said I don't know 
 I'll have to try it and see 
 I've always watched it
 And he said well fine 
 he said he lives near Brookhaven we'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it 
 If you do then we can go golf together
 Oh whoa 
 great 
 I get to walk all around a little green field all day
 But those kinds of things happen though 
 you get a little taste of it 
 and you say Hey this is not bad
 And you really begin to develop an interest in it 
 But I am not an athlete at all
 You know I'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball and hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball
 So I am not an athlete 
 Maybe golf is a forgiving sport 
 I don't know
 It doesn't appear to be 
 Uh-huh 
 I haven't really acquired an interest in it 
 but I'm open to try anything you know
 The one thing that is also detrimental as far I'm concerned my skin is very fair
 so I'm going to have to golf in the evening 
 or I'm going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me
 And I don't think the
