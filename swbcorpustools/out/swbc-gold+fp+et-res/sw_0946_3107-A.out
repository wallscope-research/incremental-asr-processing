 There we go 
 Uh so uh what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary
 That week 
 right
 Um
 Well uh right now I'm in sort of a weird situation 
 I'm a graduate student that uh 
 I don't have that many benefits per se 
 Uh sort of get 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 My wife has a real job 
 and I can see from her angle 
 Uh uh I think health insurance is real real important I've discovered 
 I mean even in my case they're really uh a pain in the neck about it up here 
 because the university makes me buy a small 
 they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance
 they offer insurance to everyone 
 but then the basics that are major medical they force you to buy here 
 Now I'm covered by my wife's anyway 
 but I still pay them a hundred dollars a semester for uh mandatory 
 So that's sort of annoying that I'm paying for something I'm not getting in that case 
 I'd rather that went to something else
 Right 
 I mean uh 
 and it turns out that actually uh [ the benefits they + you know that hundred dollars sort of would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and use them 
 and it turns out that I do think they're excellent physicians there 
 So through my wife's H M O we've registered for them as our primary care physicians 
 so we go there anyway 
 so if they were to bill which which I believe they don't 
 but if they were to bill the H M O for my business they could in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing 
 But they're not thank God 
 Uh but anyway uh otherwise I would imagine uh good vacation is important although I don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job 
 I don't you know 
 Oh wow
 So that's really 
 Yeah 
 I mean I know my wife uh 
 I think she gets you know about two weeks a year I guess
 but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off 
 They you know usually let her
 Yeah
 Oh really
 Just 
 yeah
 Yeah
 that's reasonable I think
 Yeah
 Weigh all sorts of other things
 Yeah 
 I think I was watching something the other day about that actually on uh a news special or something like that 
 and they were saying how in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance 
 and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people you know they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Least off who decides
 Right
 Right
 You want to know that when you pick a doctor you know you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about 
 Yeah 
 that's the
