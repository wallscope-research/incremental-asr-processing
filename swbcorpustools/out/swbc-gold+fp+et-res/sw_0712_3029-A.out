 Okay 
 well I'll start off being controversial 
 I'm in favor of it
 Well it seems to be in the current situations 
 but uh I still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime Particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now
 Okay
 Yeah 
 I think uh 
 Oh definitely 
 any crimes against person uh I feel uh there should be more than a slap on the hand and being sent to prison and being released in uh two or three years
 Oh yeah 
 That's a 
 I don't see a thing wrong with that
 I believe that uh Well it's just an example 
 I think there's uh someone that's on trial right now here in the Dallas area 
 and they were interviewing the the 
 a young lady was killed sometime back a young girl A personal trial and the reporter was asking a stupid question of the people outside
 *[[ Shouldn't the continued statement end after "A personal trial" and a new slash unit begin ]] Well how do you feel about this
 And you know how do they feel about it I'm sure that uh they want it over with 
 *[[ Seems that a slash should be placed after "feel about it" ]] and they want the person punished and punished properly
 Yes
 Yeah 
 Well I feel like the cost of someone who's quoting figures made the cost at like thirty thousand dollars a year to keep someone in prison
 And well the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases
 There are more and more instances being on the news
 or this individual was out on the streets on probation or parole and killed someone else Or seriously injured someone
 Yeah
 Yes
 Yes 
 indeed
 <> Yeah
 Yeah
 No
 Here again anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind uh the opportunity exists for someone to get killed
 Now I'm not in favor of gun control to the degree or anything because uh there are uses for guns which are noncriminal
 but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them Uh aside from domestic disputes husbands shooting wives or vice versa
 But these individuals if they have a gun with them I think that the sentence should be even longer than if they don't
 Well Well but here again uh if a matter of expediency part of these costs like the people on Death Row is that their appeals can take years and years
 There should be some uh 
 I know there's a law I believe that it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence
 Well I think that automatic appeal ought to take place uh within a reasonable length of time say six months/
 And a decision be made and not drag out in the courts for years because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities there might be
 Right 
 there's got to be a time limit
 a legitimate appeal not a technicality of uh if they're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime 
 They're arguing over well were his civil rights violated because uh someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time
 Those are the things that have caused them to drag out I think
 Yeah
 He didn't see his lawyer as quickly as he should have or some Mickey Mouse type thing like that
 Oh yes 
 Yes
 No 
 I'm not a lawyer 
 I 
 I'm an accountant 
 and I agree
 We practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers to a degree
 <> There you go
 Well it's a case that we have a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself
 So that's how we get caught in this uh sort of a catch twenty-two
 But you have to continue uh to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty
 Yeah
 Yes It does most people
 Again one of our problems is that uh our legislature and the state and our national congress the majority of the members thereof are lawyers
