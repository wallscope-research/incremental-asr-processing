 Okay 
 Uh my first thoughts on capital punishment i- 
 I 
 the first thing I want to say is no Just simply because we as human beings don't have the right to take another human being's life
 Uh we are punishing someone for taking someone's life 
 or in some cases we are punishing a person for taking someone's life 
 And so in effect we are committing that same crime
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Ac- 
 Uh-huh 
 One thing I don't understand is the whole concept of death row
 Okay 
 these people are supposedly I guess waiting to die 
 right
 Okay 
 And there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row 
 And I'm not saying that oh 
 I guess I am kind of saying what are we doing 
 I mean I guess that's the same thing you were saying 
 what are we doing with these people
 They're there 
 we should either take some kind of action or take enough or go a different route 
 But they're just 
 Oh exactly 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Exactly
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 But act- 
 Uh-huh
 And I guess I see both sides in that at the same time that I'm saying that you know we're committing the same crime
 I also agree that I mean if there is somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time Uh 
 there was a case in Dallas 
 well I'm sure they haven't gone to court yet 
 but uh apparently two teenage boys held up a Taco Bell 
 They put four people in a freezer and shot them all 
 Now to me that is inhumane 
 And for two people to be out in the world like that I don't want them in my world
 You understand what I am saying
 I mean I'm not for killing anyone
 but I don't want these people around at the same time 
 Exactly
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 And Uh-huh 
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 and at the same time like you said it drains society
 We 
 I think we should be 
 we 
 the same money that we're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and keep these people in prison that same money or half of that money could be used towards uh rehabilitation programs of some sort 
 Something to put these people back in society 
 but prepare them first
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Exactly
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 And you want people out of prison 
 and you want people to get jobs and live happy lives 
 But they can't just walk out of prison and do that 
 They can't just walk out of prison and say okay I'm going to go a different route
 There has to be some sort of buffer in there 
 Some sort of program or 
 and I know this costs money 
 but it couldn't cost any more money than we're already spending
 Uh-huh
 Really how 
 what can we do
 Oh goodness 
 I mean you know everyone's trying to make it you know in their own little world
 You know I'm trying to make it with my job and make you know myself okay and make my family okay 
 And it's so hard to you know try and be one of the movers and shakers I guess you would call them
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Oh yes
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 And I'm a broadcast journalist 
 and so I feel like one day I probably will write a book or something you know 
 and some of these views will be able to come out 
 I work at channel six here 
 I'm a news reporter
 And so I guess I'm pretty emotional about crime things like that now 
 I've only been in it for a year 
 but I get to see pretty much uh close up you know a lot of things that happen that people don't see 
 Uh I get to see a lot of crimes
 and I get to see you know people's uh pain and things 
 and so when we talk about 
 Yeah
 Exactly
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 A service
 Yeah 
 But still you know we can't 
 I don't know 
 I guess I would like to probably editorialize more 
 We have to just report what's happening 
 We can't say well this is what I think about you know the situation 
 Sometimes you really want to say that 
 you really want to say what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone 
 or you know that's a 
 Uh-huh
 Especially when you are dealing with a subject like uh capital punishment or something or abortion or something where there's an no or yes side 
 and you have your side 
 and you have to report both sides
 But you really don't want to because you have your side
 Yeah 
 yeah
 So sometimes that's hard 
 but Uh-huh
 That's good
 All right 
 Well it was nice talking to you
 Okay
 Okay 
 Bye bye
