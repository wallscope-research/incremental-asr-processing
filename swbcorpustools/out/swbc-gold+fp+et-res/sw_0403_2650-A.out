 Okay 
 this is really ironic that I would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away 
 And it's just been tearing me up all day 
 Because we have just been looking all over for him 
 We've been to the pound 
 we've been to the humane society 
 we've been to the adoption center 
 we've just been all over the neighborhood 
 we've been calling neighbors 
 So this is just really strange 
 No 
 this is the first time 
 Um he's gotten out before 
 but he's always stayed right here you know 
 he's never gone away 
 And so this is just really strange you know because 
 Um he's part golden Lab and part uh let's see Alaskan no not Alaskan 
 I always forget 
 Uh Australian shepherd
 And Yeah 
 he's pretty big 
 That's why it really surprises me you know that he hasn't come back because like I said he's never gone away like this before 
 and I would think you know I mean he might could get hurt by a car or something 
 I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big
 You know but I don't know 
 Thanks 
 I do too 
 Oh about two years 
 So he's 
 Yeah 
 it's really 
 gosh anyway 
 isn't that funny how we do
 I mean we just really 
 Yeah 
 Well they're companions
 Well do you have any
 Um 
 How do they get along together
 Um
 Oh yeah
 That's what are so neat about animals 
 I mean they're really companions you know 
 and they're friends you know 
 I mean you can love them all you want 
 and they love you right back 
 and they don't 
 No
 I know
 It's just so neat You know 
 it's 
 that's 
 I don't know 
 this is just so hard
 it's like I said we've had him for two years 
 and he's never 
 I mean he's gotten out 
 but he's always been right there 
 He's never been gone for at all
 you know he's just always been right there when he gets out
 You know it's the first time he's ever been gone like this 
 Uh I just knew today uh you know that we looked at the pound and that we just went all over the place 
 and I knew we were going to find him you know 
 and when we didn't it was like oh no 
 So I don't know
 Yeah 
 we keep you know 
 they told us like at the Humane Society and the adoption center you know don't give up hope you know 
 and then Well not yet 
 We were talking about that tonight since you know he just got out yesterday 
 we were just talking about that whether 
 we were trying to find some pictures of him recently 
 We've got so many when he was a puppy 
 you know but we just don't have a whole lot 
 We have him on film you know on the video camera 
 You know but you can't put that on the 
 you know So I don't know 
 we will put Some posters and stuff up 
 And hopefully that will help you know maybe around the neighborhood 
 But we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood 
 so that helps too you know if they can keep 
 yeah 
 so 
 I think that if somebody else picks him up 
 I think that uh if he gets out he'll come back
 You know I really do because he knows exactly where he lives 
 so 
 I know 
 it's just so ironic that this would happen 
 and I would get this kind of a call 
 I know
 it's very strange 
 but 
 Well that's good 
 That's one thing about cats though 
 they're so small 
 and you know they can get hurt a lot easier
 You know they can get hurt a lot easier you know
 so that would make you really tend to worry about them you know if they're not right there 
 Is that right
 Huh 
 That's really 
 I guess I really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them
 so I never had them growing up
 so you know I never really had them around me you know 
 so I've never owned one you know since I 
 Huh
 Huh 
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 I like the way they come up 
 and they'll put their head underneath your hand you know
 that 
 and uh most dogs do that 
 I mean 
 I don't know any that really don't 
 I mean you know they know exactly how to get that attention you know
 they just you know come up 
 and they put your you know 
 or they'll rub their head against you you know 
 Well no 
 Well well he's outside during the day 
 and then we get home at night we do bring him in
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 The backyard it's really big too for him to run in and stuff 
 That's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out you know because he's had all this room to run in 
 but 
 He dug a hole under the fence
 Well see he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole 
 and you know we filled it back up put him back in there 
 He did it again 
 so we chained him up
 you know but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because you know we feel like that's just too restricting for him
 So uh we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it you know so that he couldn't get out
 Well he kind of ripped through the chicken wire 
 So I can't 
 I just have not 
 I don't understand you know because it's like he's got a good home you know 
 he's got 
 I mean we have two kids you know that just love him a lot
 You know it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out you know 
 we just couldn't 
 Yeah 
 I guess that's 
 Yeah 
 I guess that's probably true 
 I don't think it's anything we did 
 Least I hope not 
 No 
 I know 
 I mean you know he really does have a good home 
 I think that's what really bothers me the most about it 
 You know it's like 
 Well I don't know if it's quite hit them 
 I have two girls
 and they just been real uh 
 I don't know 
 at first you know they seemed to be upset 
 but now it's like uh well if he doesn't come home can we get another dog 
 It's like wait a minute you know 
 poor Buddy you know 
 I said he's only been gone a day 
 and you already want to replace him 
 Buddy
 Uh-huh
 Is that right 
 Oh 
 That's funny
 Yeah
 Oh
 I didn't know that
 I had no idea
 I did not know that
