 I don't know how much I know about this subject 
 Yeah
 Okay 
 Go ahead
 Yeah 
 That's true
 Um me either 
 I went to college and then started working and then got married 
 and 
 No 
 I haven't 
 I know that uh my sister 
 I have a twin sister 
 and when they graduated she went to uh teach in a small town down in south Texas 
 and I know that like if you have college notes if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your you know your college note or whatever 
 Uh-huh 
 If it's like you know really you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as you know to live 
 Yeah 
 she only taught there one year 
 but I 
 Uh-huh
 And um I think it would be 
 I know that also one of my cousins who uh he is in like the therapy type thing 
 and he was um 
 some group paid part of his college income 
 but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at uh uh 
 I mean it's a nursing home or something like that
 So you know if 
 I think that's a good way you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want
 Yeah
 As far as yeah getting doctors and all that stuff yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I really don't know that much about it 
 you know I think of the Peace Corps you know more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when 
 Yeah 
 And don't they go into other countries and stuff
 Uh-huh
 Things that make the 
 yeah
 Make them more self-supporting
 Yeah
 Right 
 Yeah
 But it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I don't know that you could require everyone yeah to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that 
 I don't know that that would work if somebody's didn't really want to be there and didn't have 
 Yeah 
 I mean there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well 
 Down here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that I think probably need help and could be helped
 Yeah
 And maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like um during college you know maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work and help people in that area or people in the United States
 There probably are you know 
 for 
 but I'm sure 
 that's probably like people that do that are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff 
 but I think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize it's everybody's responsibility to um help these people you know 
 and no- 
 I'm not saying just give them money 
 but I mean because they have to be taught to be 
 Yeah 
 I mean I know that's what my father-in-law was talking about you know when you give these people money 
 or what was it 
 they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give um more money to these people 
 I mean and that's not really the answer I mean because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that 
 but 
 Yeah
 Or you know to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves
 I mean I guess we're getting kind of off the subject here 
 but 
 Yeah 
 I mean it's 
 True 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Flower Mound 
 yeah 
 So we're a little you know farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing
