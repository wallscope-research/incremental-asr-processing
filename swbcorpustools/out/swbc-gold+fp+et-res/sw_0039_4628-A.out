 what sort of company do you work for 
 Do you work for a big or a little place
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh 
 Well I work for uh actually probably similar kind of place 
 I work for uh Lincoln Laboratory
 Uh yeah 
 We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech
 Uh and uh 
 so we're actually part of M I T 
 So it's very much the same kind of place uh the technical institution
 Uh while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of uh uh what things were important uh besides salary and a job I guess uh list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe uh the challenge of the work and uh the working conditions things like that
 I don't know 
 uh what sorts of things would you consider important
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Now how do you mean that 
 I know it 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well you think it's better than to try to spread the effort equally among all the employees of the company 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that 
 I think uh back about a few years ago when things were tough Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile 
 They went to a four and a half day work week rather than yeah just cut everybody back ten percent And uh have to give everybody a half day a week off
 And I think you can do that for a little while 
 but I'm 
 Yeah
