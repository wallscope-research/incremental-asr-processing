 Okay 
 Have you faced uh elderly care yet uh nursing home care for any of your parents
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 I think sooner or later uh 
 both my mother and my husband's mother we had to end up putting in nursing homes 
 and they were to the point that they only lived both of them about six weeks once they got in
 And uh-huh 
 And I believe that was one of the hardest things I ever did In my life 
 you know it's absolutely devastating
 What have you found in dealing with the nursing homes
 Yes 
 Um uh-huh
 Yes
 Yes
 No 
 uh well there's a little bit of difference in the two between my mother and my mother-in-law
 And uh theirs both ran 
 oh I think my mother-in-law's was like fifteen hundred 
 and my mother's was two thousand 
 this has been five years ago 
 And uh uh one of the things that you know I had discovered is that if they knew that I came in there at all different hours they got much better care than if 
 when I started out with my mother-in-law because she was in there first I would go certain hours 
 and they knew 
 And if I'd pop in unexpectedly I discovered you know they did better 
 You know uh-huh 
 And you know a couple of times with my mother-in-law I would catch something not being taken care of And you know would have to rate 
 so I got to where I knew then when my mother was in you know not to go the same time all the time Because they would 
 and when I was looking for the nursing homes another thing that I learned uh 
 we had my mother all set to go into one 
 and for some reason I just went back and on my own went around the different floors
 And I saw areas that they had not shown me 
 and they did not come across as well as you know what they had originally shown me 
 so uh we did not put her in that one 
 We put her in another one that I went a couple of times when they weren't expecting me and saw and you know was much uh better pleased with the situation
 Yes 
 you do
