 Okay
 Oh yes 
 Cycling computers uh backpacking just about everything
 Oh I generically have you know millions of hobbies
 Uh-huh
 I'm not quite that bad
 I'm just a weekend cyclist
 Handicraft type things
 Yeah 
 just whittle away my life 
 Uh no 
 no 
 I c- 
 Uh uh
 Oh that's pretty good
 Yeah 
 they 
 my only craft work is kind of like computers and you know go off to the little computer club meetings 
 and it's kind of nice because I've made money at it too 
 Considering I work for it a living 
 but I've got a couple of articles published
 It's kind of neat
 Oh yeah 
 just all over the place 
 They just get around and talk techy or else uh uh you know 
 like half the members are really expert 
 and the other half are like really not
 And uh we kind of help out the people who are really not 
 Oh I think I'm a hacker 
 but I'm not uh the you know dial around randomly trying to break into computers type hackers 
 no 
 that's one of those sports I don't go for
 Yeah
 Backpacking
 Yeah 
 I belong to a Boy Scout troop 
 It beats paying United Way 
 I just you know donate a whole bunch of my time to the Boy Scouts and have fun
 Uh-huh
 Uh well just last weekend went to Davy Crockett forest which is kind of out in east Texas
 And we go to uh places out in 
 uh uh let's see 
 what's that state north of us 
 that state 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 that one 
 That one
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 And 
 Uh no 
 to a uh old Indian fort that's out there 
 Trying to think of the name of it 
 Durn 
 Well yeah 
 no 
 sorry 
 no memory
 No 
 I missed out this last year 
 I wasn't able to get the time off but maybe next year 
 It's a good possibility
 Oh yeah 
 yeah 
 When I was a kid uh we'd do the equivalent thing in the High Sierras 
 That was loads of fun
 Uh no 
 not quite because I'm not a whole family 
 I'm just me 
 Oh yeah 
 I rent my kids 
 It's better than you know owning on them and making payments on them and you know things like that
 Oh yeah 
 yeah 
 Uh not recently because you know like the Boy Scouts makes it so that I go like once a month you know Someplace 
 But uh there's uh some stuff that I want to do with like Sierra Club and go down to Grand Canyon or something like that 
 So you know they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go 
 Which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you which seems just a tad more relaxing 
 Uh-huh
