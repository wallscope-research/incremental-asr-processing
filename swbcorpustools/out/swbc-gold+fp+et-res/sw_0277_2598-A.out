 Yeah 
 I'm trying to think what I've seen lately 
 I me- we- 
 well we just finished watching uh TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on tape you know 
 Yeah 
 we've seen that 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 it was great 
 have you seen it
 Yeah 
 I um 
 we saw an we liked it 
 but you know I didn't think it was as good as all the uh hype was about it
 Yeah 
 I don- 
 I couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for uh best picture
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and so we just 
 Uh um you know it depends on wh- 
 I'd like to see those 
 you know um you know there's like three movies that I keep telling myself that I should see you know some day that I haven't seen you know that are classics you know 
 Because I've never seen CITIZEN KANE
 and I've never seen CASABLANCA and never seen GONE WITH THE WIND
 Uh-huh 
 Oh I def- 
 we saw part of THE AFRICAN QUEEN on T V a couple of years ago
 and I've been wanting to see all of it 
 but you know we walk into the video store 
 and we're like well why don't we go see this now 
 so 
 But um I think- 
 one of the movies we saw recently we saw uh MISERY
 That was good um
 oh it was great
 And it 
 you think you know you know because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory 
 but there's only one 
 well there's a couple scenes at the end there is you know some blood and everything 
 and there's one really bad scene where I mean there's not blood but it's pretty graphic 
 But um it's a really good movie um
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 he's a writer 
 and um she's his biggest fan 
 and she's also a little on the nutso side
 No 
 we haven't um
 Oh it wasn't
 Oka- 
 I got 
 I heard like mixed reviews um of that 
 we s- 
 that's on our list of things to see 
 N- 
 our big thing is um 
 you know movie prices up here 
 I think it's like six bucks now in the theaters
 you know So it's like 
 you know a lot of things we try to catch like at the dollar theater or matinees 
 and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape
 Ye- 
 well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was uh EDWARD SCISSORHANDS
 Yeah 
 have you seen that
 Oh it was great 
 Yeah 
 it was 
 No 
 no 
 um it's an odd film 
 and it's really interesting that 
 I like the director a lot um a guy named Tim Burton
 Did you ever see the movie BEETLEJUICE
 Oh ok- 
 Oh se- 
 yeah 
 well if you liked BEETLEJUICE you'll probably like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS 
 if you didn't like BEETLEJUICE you'll probably won't like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS
 Yeah 
 it's um 
 Burton's kind of uh e- 
 he's a very odd man 
 but he's 
 I think he's very interesting 
 and uh I liked those two movies of his a lot
 He did BATMAN also which you know 
 It was good 
 but I mean he was um 
 Yeah
 Oh yeah oh 
 Yeah
 Um don't really know 
 I like Costner a lot 
 but uh I'm a big baseball fan 
 so you know after BULL DURHAM and FIELD OF DREAMS you know 
 Um although you know 
 Which one
 Yeah 
 FIELD OF DREAMS was good 
 um and I think I liked the other movies he's done 
 NO WAY OUT was really good 
 and 
 did you ever see SILVERADO
 Um let's see 
 Danny Glover Scott Glen Kevin Kline um Brian Dennehy Jeff Goldblum's in 
 Uh John Kreas is in it if you don't blink
 it was a big western 
 I mean I think Roseanne Arquett was in it too another one that if you blink you'd miss her 
 Uh it was 
 and I think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours 
 and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out
 Um but it was really good Um
 Uh-huh 
 No 
 I didn't 
 is that any good
 Oh okay
 Yeah 
 we were in the video store today 
 and somebody was recommending it to somebody 
 You know the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else
 Huh well I'll have to catch it one of these days 
 You sa- 
 you said you seen NO WAY OUT
 Yeah 
 that was very good 
 Um he was in THE UNTOUCHABLES too
 Yeah 
 it was on um 
 no 
 it was on one of the networks I think last weekend Uh or two weeks ago 
 Yeah 
 um I wish I mean I'd seen it when you know it was originally in the theaters 
 and um you know I saw part of it again
 I mean you know I like Costner 
 I like Sean Connery 
 and uh there's this one actor 
 it's really silly that I enjoy him a lot 
 but I've really enjoyed him in everything I've seen him in a guy named Charles Martin Smith
 Um you've probably seen him 
 and just an 
 you know oh that's who the guy is
 Do you remember 
 did you ever see AMERICAN GRAFFITI
 Oh 
 Did you ever see the movie STAR MAN
 Okay 
 in STAR MAN he was the guy chasing after um Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen or Nancy Allen
 You know w- 
 short nerdy guy with glasses
 he's just 
 I don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in 
 He was in the UNTOUCHABLES 
 He was the accountant 
 Yeah 
 No 
 no 
 you're thinking of Rick Moranis 
 He looks like Rick Moranis 
 but he's not 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh a little of 
 e- 
 e- 
 a review usually won't make me go see a movie I hadn't already wanted to see
 No 
 it's o- uh 
 I want to see it
 Um we want to see GODFATHER PART THREE also 
 but my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago
 but I've never seen either of the GODFATHER movies 
 so we're probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere
 Yeah
 Oh okay 
 I haven't never read it
 Uh-huh 
 We just rented um a couple weeks ago a movie called THE FRESHMAN 
 with um 
 it's got Matthew Broderick in it and um uh Marlon Brando 
 And Brando like does a parody of the character he played in THE GODFATHER
 Um yeah 
 it's one of the reasons why you know THE GODFATHER's been on our minds lately 
 Um but uh there's a bunch of scenes uh uh from THE GODFATHER that's used because Matthew Broderick's going to film school 
 And uh in his classes they're running a bunch of scenes from THE GODFATHER 
 and then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing you know you know this uh organized crime head
 So it was a fun movie
 Uh
 I liked RAINMAN 
 I thought it was interesting that he was doing som- 
 Yeah 
 well I'm 
 being from Baltimore of course I'm a big Barry Levinson fan since uh you know he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies
 Um n- 
 Barry Levinson did um DINER and TINMAN and AVALON which are all set in Baltimore
 Uh-huh 
 Ye- 
 we- 
 Ye- 
 of the three of those DINER's probably the best 
 I mean they're all pretty good 
 but DINER is really worth seeing
 Uh late fifties 
 yeah
 Okay 
 and uh
