 Well uh I'm not certain that it does a lot of good I mean that it ends up effectively uh uh uh avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital penalties 
 Yet on the other hand uh I don't know 
 I mean there is things that 
 seems like it's the right thing to do 
 Now you know I mean a serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns you know fifty children in a school yard 
 you kind of 
 I don't know 
 What about yourself
 Uh-huh
 I mean people like 
 I 
 it's been 
 I mean like the Arab societies and stuff end up uh having effective punishments 
 and they're extremely severe 
 Uh you know I think to a certain degree the reason that it doesn't serve as a deterrent uh may be because you never know if it's going to be applied Right 
 uh like in Arab societies If you get caught stealing they chop off your hand 
 and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand 
 and everybody knows exactly what for
 Uh you know and here with our court system and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can kind of always count on the fact 
 or there is a good chance you're going to get off
 Uh-huh Yeah 
 some people 
 Yeah
 Except that I mean the average cost to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is extremely high I mean something I was amazed at Uh uh per year 
 it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year To keep people in jail 
 Uh you know and it's sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment 
 but on the other hand uh uh you know I don't know if that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail uh 
 Uh-huh <>
 Oh I know 
 I mean you can't 
 taking one more life doesn't get things back the way they were right 
 Yeah 
 I really don't know uh
 I'm in Texas
 w- 
 No 
 I'm in Austin
 where are you calling from
 Oh I see 
 uh-huh
 Texas is one of the s- well 
 I guess there is more and more states that are going back to capital punishment 
 Uh Texas has had it for a while 
 It's one of the quickest 
 it 
 once it was reallowed 
 I think it was outlawed for a while uh by the supreme court I mean or the interpretation of the constitution 
 and it seems like everybody stopped 
 and then once they sort of reallowed it Texas was one of the first to actually uh implement it again
 They do it by lethal injection
 Uh I'm originally from Kansas 
 and in Kansas also uh they almost immediately put back capital punishment 
 and uh there they do it by hanging
 Still uh they have 
 I still remember the movie uh IN COLD BLOOD 
 I don't know if you've ever 
 I'm sure you're familiar with it 
 but have you seen the movie
 Yeah 
 That way
 Yeah 
 well they show it 
 not 
 I mean the movie was made in like nineteen sixty-two or something like that
 and so uh it's not particularly graphic 
 but on the other hand it's fairly impressive to watch them you know walk into the room with gallows 
 It's kind of a barn like structure
 Is that right 
 Are you there in school
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 has a 
 yeah 
 Has a real bullets 
 and the rest of them have blanks
 Yeah 
 I certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner 
 I know that 
 I've always said that if I had to kill and clean and do my own meat I think I'd become a vegetarian
 As long as you're sort of safely removed from it it seems not so bad I guess
