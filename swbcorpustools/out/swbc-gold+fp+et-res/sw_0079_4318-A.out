 Before the one will take 
 uh okay 
 let's see 
 I guess uh I can start 
 we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing 
 Yeah 
 Uh so I'm looking at uh something larger than what we have 
 We've got like an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and uh an eighty-nine Horizon 
 So I'm looking for something uh bigger 
 yeah 
 Uh so we were thinking mini van for a while 
 and uh we're looking at uh some just four door five passenger sedans as well
 Uh I don't really have a preference either way I guess You know 
 you know it 
 I guess the American cars had a bad reputation 
 but I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I mean even if it's just details it seems like uh they you know 
 I j- 
 there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal 
 and you have to take it back every once in a while 
 It's clearly just a design problem there
 Uh-huh
 Oh like a Miata or something like that
 Um 
 Interesting
 Yeah
 That's interesting 
 Yeah 
 I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for you know size and safety and then mileage 
 Probably
 Uh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think in terms of computer terminology I look at you know price performance and things like that And then a little bit at life expectancy I guess 
 but it you know depends on what you pay initially 
 But you know I've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger 
 Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage 
 and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton
 It's you know 
 we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles 
 but uh the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it 
 But uh 
 Um 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 That's interesting 
 But 
 yeah 
 it's hard to beat some of the 
 uh like I guess in particular we're looking at like a ninety-one Corsica uh buy back at a they say G M sponsored auction 
 but I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it 
 and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you 
 Yeah 
 because I guess uh 
 I mean well ninety-two's granted but the new ones you know 
 fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot 
 so all the depreciation has been taken off 
 and the dealer comes out okay you know 
 I don't know what kind of hit they take on it 
 but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it 
 but uh I don't know 
 we keep looking at that mini van 
 It's just you know 
 we can get like a Caravan at twelve five
 but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now 
 But uh uh it's interesting 
 but uh I don't know 
 if uh it seems to be
