 All right 
 so uh you live in Dallas
 Now I understand that um the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down
 Oh
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 we have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of Washington
 Huh 
 Do you live in the high-rise
 Uh-huh
 Oh okay 
 so you have one floor all to yourself
 Oh okay
 Oh that's nice 
 Do you get your own washer dryer
 Oh
 Yeah 
 That is nice
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I've always uh been pretty lucky 
 The real estate out here's been pretty good 
 well the prices came down last year 
 we had sort of like a Dallas syndrome 
 The past uh uh year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia
 It just never happened before
 So it's really surprising everybody 
 All the developers don't know what to do 
 Yeah
 unfortunate- 
 uh we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids
 and we have a three bedroom house 
 And it's pretty much filled up right now
 Yeah 
 uh-huh 
 Get an extra bedroom or a basement 
 Right now it's just a single level rambler
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there 
 and that's what he said was that you know it just wasn't something that people had down there
 They put pools and garages on but uh no basements 
 Huh
 Maybe it's all the sand 
 Is there a lot of sand in 
 I always think it's like a desert 
 I don't know 
 Dallas always 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well out here um we live in what used to be uh like a prairie or whatever a you know natural grasslands
 And uh they 
 it's just you go down four inches 
 and well fourteen inches you get to sandstone 
 And so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast 
 It's just solid sandstone
 No 
 Virginia
 Yeah 
 it's sort of unusual really 
 Most of Virginia is clay
 Oh yeah 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 uh my folks used to live there 
 Back before I was born they lived there
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well uh Texas is a big state 
 so I imagine the type of houses and uh things like that are truly different from area to area 
 But uh that's the same way out here 
 because um well for example we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington
 and anything instead the highway the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive
 So you know I could never afford a house inside the beltway 
 That's why we came out here 
 This is called the country you know with only you know maybe twenty miles total from D C twenty-five from the city 
 But um it's considered the country since it's uh you know that far out
 But um yeah 
 we live out by Dulles Airport
 Yeah 
 and uh that's one of the few places still in northern Virginia 
 they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here 
 and you know it's still pretty rural
 Uh not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore 
 Land has gotten so expensive 
 they just can't afford to have low income housing like that
 No 
 we're in a development
 There's uh 
 yeah 
 there's another one or a quarter acre away rather
 Oh no 
 Huh-uh 
 You have to uh stay in one single family home 
 I sort of got spoiled with that when I was growing up
 Uh my folks um had an apartment for a while when we were kids 
 but um for the most part they always had you know 
 and Pennsylvania always had a single family home 
 and so you know as soon as we could we got a single family home 
 and that's all I ever knew growing up
 so I stayed in a townhouse for uh two years and then uh saved up enough money to get a
