 Yeah 
 one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from Or sources 
 That's what I would think
 Right 
 Yeah 
 I think the automobile definitely is an area and any industry that burns you know
 and then I don't know about chemical pollution 
 I'm not real into that as far as how it affects the air 
 I know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution 
 They have offices that are too well insulated 
 They found people are getting sick
 but I don't know if that affects outside 
 You know I think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside 
 and the only thing I can think of would be cars and factories
 Yeah
 Right 
 Yeah 
 well that's destroying the ozone isn't it
 Yeah 
 that's wh- 
 It's kind of scary
 Yeah 
 I think something too that you probably see in older states all we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces
 I think it will 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 Yeah 
 In this area too since you know in Texas we're so spread out
 we have to drive so far 
 but I know in Colorado I have witnessed that where uh it just stacks up when the Rockies starts 
 but we're even getting it here 
 We can when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas
 and you can tell it in the mornings too 
 My husband likes to go out and jog 
 and there's just a brown fog here 
 and we don't even have any mountains that are holding it in 
 But they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets
 You don't have to have mountains that are stopping it
 And uh they uh making more and more high-rise buildings 
 uh so yeah 
 we can comment 
 and we didn't see this a few years ago
 It was pretty clear here
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 And it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that 
 It's a lot of waste 
 but
