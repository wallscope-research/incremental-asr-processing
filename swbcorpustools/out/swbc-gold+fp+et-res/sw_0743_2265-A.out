 Okay 
 My major source of information I guess is T V news 
 Excuse me I uh wake up to it in the morning 
 This is I guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while I'm getting ready to go to work 
 Oh I quite frequently glance through headlines or in the newspaper 
 But uh primarily mine is T V news 
 How about yourself
 Huh-uh 
 *[[ LISTEN-- I think this and successive "Huh-uh" answers should be "Uh-huh"]] True
 Huh-uh
 Well that's true 
 but I 
 my personal opinion is that the various network news medias were trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military
 Now I can appreciate that especially after what happened in Vietnam
 Uh let's face it 
 today's uh means of communication a newscaster could very well giveaway a piece of top secret information And uh pat himself on the back for uh making a good scoop
 Very true 
 I find T-News very enlightening too
 And I check that everyday 
 Of course with that goes along with the stock price of T I
 Of course T-NEWS is more or less headlines
 Uh I don't think much of their sports coverage
 Only give the scores
 But uh that's all right 
 outside of pro football I'm not too interested in other games other sports anyway
 But the uh T-NEWS is a good way to keep up-to-date 
 I think they do a pretty good job of selecting the most important items
 Huh-uh
 Well I spent twenty years in commercial broadcasting radio and T V 
 and I know what it takes to get some of those little bits and pieces of news on the air
 I mean there are times where uh the reporter actually will risk life and limb 
 I've seen it happen time and time again 
 And uh well I remember one time up in Nashville Tennessee 
 One of the fellows got mixed up in a riot that was going on down there
 but he was lucky he got out of it for some reason 
 Because he was carrying a camera 
 uh they left him alone
 Huh-uh
 Nice to talk to you too Jim
 No
 Oh 
 Well I'll be looking for it then
 Is that right
 Well good *[[slash error]] You too
