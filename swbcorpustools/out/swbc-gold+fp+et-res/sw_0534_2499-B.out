 Okay
 The latest movie I've seen that I thought was fantastic was DANCES WITH WOLVES 
 Oh man 
 <> I just finally ended up going to see it uh 
 and one day my husband had the kids 
 and I just went because we could never get to go see it together because it's so long 
 By the time we had a babysitter for that long 
 So I finally just went to see it 
 And I just thought it was fantastic
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 That was quite a <> 
 the buffalo scene in that thing was so real 
 It's like 
 I mean it just blew me away
 Yeah 
 Uh I'm afraid to go see that one 
 That one looks so scary just from the previews 
 I thought gosh I'd probably have nightmares for the next six months 
 It's supposed to be good though 
 I know some friends who went to see it
 They said it was really riveting
 Well you're not a thirteen year old 
 I don't know 
 I saw it when I was a kid 
 and I thought oh man 
 Oh uh-huh
 Oh really 
 Huh Gosh 
 Oh boy 
 Gosh 
 Call the crisis line 
 Yeah 
 I bet
 Oh gosh
 I saw one I thought was crummy 
 With that new uh Michael J Fox movie THE HARD WAY 
 Where he plays a actor that's uh like th- huh 
 Oh I know 
 It was 
 well I ended up at the theater 
 and there didn't seem to be anything else on I wanted to see 
 so I'll try that 
 But it wasn't worth anything 
 I didn't care for that at all
 Yeah 
 Well the last two I saw him in one of those BACK TO THE FUTURE PART THREE deals 
 and that was crummy also 
 I didn't think that was any good 
 so 
 Yeah
 Oh boy
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well I hadn't read it 
 and I couldn't figure what was going on half the time 
 so 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I should probably go back and read the book now that I just saw the movie again not too long ago 
 Wow Huh
 Huh Well I have one I bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids OTIS AND MILO
 Oh that is the most precious movie 
 It has to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life 
 And it's all this 
 it's the story of this little cat and dog 
 and it's not like cutesy 
 uh it's just so realistic Everything they do 
 You wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things 
 And it was A real dog and cat 
 and all the other animals 
 They initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised 
 And then the cat gets um on this treacherous journey 
 He climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river 
 and he winds up all over creation 
 I don't know where in the world it is 
 Somewhere in China somewhere I think that it was filmed 
 But uh it's just really an incredible thing 
 Yeah 
 It was pretty wild 
 and Of course the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it
 But there's you know nothing else to keep it going 
 But it really keeps me going 
 I've seen it twice now 
 Huh
 Yeah 
 It was like the best of the Walt Disney ones 
 Walt Disney's kind of gotten worse in my opinion over the past few years 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 All those old good ones that you you know wish they had on more now 
 but 
 Oh boy 
 Huh 
 That's pretty good 
 Really
 Let's see 
 What are some other ones I've seen lately 
 I'm trying to remember 
 I can't 
 Oh I just saw one on the video 
 Oh um have you seen THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY PART TWO
 That is a riot
 Yeah 
 The first one was really good 
 But the second one is really good too 
 I was really surprised 
 No 
 I thought it was funny 
 But that's my sense of humor 
 It's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore 
 And I guess I'm just middle America or something 
 I just go to be entertained 
 and not really interested in like the TERMINATOR or some of the Schwarzenegger stuff 
 I just 
 Yeah 
 FREDDY'S REVENGE PART TWENTY-FIVE or whatever 
 Yeah 
 I've never 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I've never seen any of those
 Yeah 
 I can't either 
 He seems so macho I just 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 When they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can 
 You don't
 That's like 
 my husband does that 
 He can watch them over and over 
 And I'm 
 there's very few I would want to see that many times 
 So once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over 
 Oh yeah 
 That was a good one 
 I haven't seen that one in a long time 
 Yeah 
 Oh boy
 Uh-huh
 Oh gosh
 Huh
 Yeah 
 I bet 
 Gosh
 Oh boy 
 So that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that
 Oh really 
 Well when I was in England years ago 
 And I went to like Shakespeare's and you know Stratford-On-Avon and all that 
 and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it 
 because it was so short 
 The ceilings were so short 
 But Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh boy 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Did you see any movies over there 
 I remember I went to see DON QUIXOTE over there when it came out 
 It came out right around the time with Sophia Loren 
 and that was a riot to see that 
 Yeah 
 Cause when you're touristing you probably don't want to take the time to go see a movie
 Huh
 Oh boy 
 Uh-huh
 Oh boy
 Yeah
 That sounds great
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh boy 
 Probably some of them did 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It's hard to know what the good movies are anymore
 Because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by 
 Yeah
 Oh I see 
 It's kind of like waterfront property or something you know if you're two miles away from water 
 Water view 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
