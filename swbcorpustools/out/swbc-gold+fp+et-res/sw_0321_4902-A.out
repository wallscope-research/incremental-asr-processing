 And you say you have some strong feelings about uh the issue
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well I'm a little bit ambivalent 
 uh and I think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it uh in terms of what uh really is driving it 
 They're not willing to tell the truth The same way with uh issues of uh race and things like that 
 I mean right now uh I believe there are two policies uh that the government uses to modulate immigration Three actually 
 One is at the high end uh 
 they always want to be able to uh do some brain draining 
 They always like to be able to attract the uh Einsteins or the Professor Chou 
 or you know 
 They'd like to be able to get the top people in any field 
 and so they can almost always find room for someone like that 
 At the bottom end they uh are always willing to uh let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area 
 Those are two things that I think are going on Although I don't think the politicians would tell you that
 And then the third thing is uh the political aspect of uh uh letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico 
 They cannot close off the Mexican border Not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico uh uh would spill over to this country 
 so they keep allowing uh the pressure cooker to let off steam
 Uh that's one of the few things I guess I found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan 
 I think they're a very difficult group to integrate into uh society 
 They're very difficult uh group to find jobs uh and uh places for 
 And so uh uh I don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem uh in that they're pretty miserable where they are 
 But I'm not to sympathetic about uh letting large numbers of Haitians in
 Yeah
 Right 
 But yeah If you let them in a million at a time you know it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population But politically and economically 
 Yeah 
 well I know about it 
 Uh I mean it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans uh twenty years ago 
 On the other hand you know the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than our first generation immigrant 
 So uh there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in
 Right 
 Sure
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
