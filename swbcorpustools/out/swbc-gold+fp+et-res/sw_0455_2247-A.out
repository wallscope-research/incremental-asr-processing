 Okay um 
 now the term personal computer uh 
 I don't happen to have one at home Um 
 but I do have a personal computer on my desk here
 Yeah 
 uh yeah 
 it's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to uh shall we say bypass the formal procurement process 
 And uh it works just fine 
 It says it's a monochrome monitor Panasonic printer uh no big deal 
 it does the things I need for it to do
 No 
 it's not even that
 Uh I think that's about where it is
 Uh yeah 
 I do that 
 I do uh some Lotus on it Uh do some uh Samna some uh P F M uh nothing extremely complex
 Uh-huh
 Yep
 Oh yeah 
 I bet that's a pretty nice setup
 Yep
 Wow
 Yep
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Right
 Well um I seem to always be in the next to the last generation of word processing software 
 When everyone was in Samna I was still in P F M 
 and now that I finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect 
 So I can never quite stay current with that
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Huh
 I can believe that
 No 
 not really 
 I'm not that up be on that sort of thing
 Oh okay
 Oh okay 
 Okay 
 Oh well it sounds like you're pretty much into computers
 I can believe that 
 Well it's been interesting
 Yeah 
 of course needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing
 I wo- 
 is that the newest thing now the four eighty-six
 that must be a fairly recent release
 Okay 
 okay 
 Because I had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes 
 but I didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet
 Uh-huh

 Bye-bye
