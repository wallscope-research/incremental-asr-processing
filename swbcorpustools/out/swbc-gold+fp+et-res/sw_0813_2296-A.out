 Um I try to ride the stationary bicycle every day about five miles
 and I love to walk 
 so if I have a lunch hour with nice weather I get out and walk 
 What about you
 Uh very good
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 there are lots of bike paths 
 I know my son is a biker 
 and he's done the whole canal I think it's a hundred and eighty miles with the scouts
 but that somehow takes organization 
 For me it's much easier just the stationary bike 
 you know it's at home I can do some of my reading
 Um but 
 No 
 I live in Maryland
 Right 
 right 
 and that's it um 
 at work we have a nice campus 
 so I'm able to um take advantage of the environment here Uh the neighborhood also 
 I mean we're within walking distance of stores and shops 
 so I do 
 Now I think um 
 basically is your motive simply um health or because you enjoy it
 Uh-huh 
 right 
 I think pretty much you summed up my motivations also
 Oh well that's great 
 that's great
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 And actually in summer I like to swim 
 We don't have facilities for swimming in winter 
 and that's true when I go home from work at the end of the day if I go up for an hour in the pool I'm much much more awake 
 I'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening
 So
 No 
 I'm not
 No
 Oh really
 No 
 I don't know that 
 But I must say that um when I did do a linguistics course in school ages ago um the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent
 And it's probably because I was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California 
 and at that point that was sort of the limit but since then I've been abroad a lot 
 so It's a mixture
 In Santa Barbara
 Oh I see
 Uh-huh 
 Well very good 
 I think we've probably know each other's exercise habits
 and uh it was nice talking to you
 Oh okay
 Bye-bye
