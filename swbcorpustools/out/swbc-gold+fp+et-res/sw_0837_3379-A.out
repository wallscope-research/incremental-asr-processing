 Let me ask you Do you think the Soviet Union is a still a threat to the United States
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well I think there's a struggle within the Soviet Union 
 Um I think the people are just fed up 
 and I think it's showing 
 and all the republic is trying to gain their independence 
 and I think uh that's making Gorbachev and others realize that hey maybe this Communist thing isn't working
 Right
 That's right
 I think 
 Well that could be 
 You know what I 
 we think of the K G B and we think such bad things you know 
 But I wouldn't doubt if the Soviet people think C I A and they think such bad things you know
 exactly 
 They do
 Oh yeah 
 they do you know
 Oh yeah 
 Oh absolutely
 That's part of that propaganda thing 
 and I think if we can get away from that or if we can keep that out of our minds oh 
 excuse me I've got a cold today
 Thank you 
 Um I think if we can get that propaganda thing because I'm sure both countries are you know thinking K G B and C I A and all that 
 but uh just on an economic point of view if the Soviet Union doesn't do something fast they ain't going to be able to feed their people this winter you know
 But on the other hand I'm kind of getting fed up with uh our own country and presidency uh always concerning themselves with other nations' problems when we have so many at home yet
 Right
 Right
 That's right 
 You know uh we've got quite a few domestic problems uh that I feel we ought to be concentrating more on 
 I think the problem is you know 
 on the international scope maybe the president feels that uh you know for long-term relations with all these countries it's important 
 and well we'll always have the United States 
 And you know we need to solve these international problems 
 but um I think I heard in the news about last week sometime that uh the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on a domestic issue because the American public is kind of getting fed up with it
 Right
 Right
 Yep
 No
 That's right
 That's right
 Well uh I think in the long
