 Okay Leslie 
 I'd like to find out a little bit about your hobbies 
 What do you like to do in your spare time
 Actually it's a cherished commodity now days huh
 Oh great
 Uh-huh
 What kind of music
 Oh okay
 Well great 
 I enjoy music too 
 and I uh 
 one thing that I like to do uh is sit down and play the piano 
 I can't play that well 
 but I uh sit down and enjoy playing musical selections that I am familiar with my family is familiar with 
 I enjoy that
 Uh a couple of hobbies that I also have is uh 
 I really enjoy bike riding 
 and the biggest hobbies I have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in
 Like my uh oldest boy is involved in soccer 
 so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football 
 and uh we also like to uh ride bicycles 
 So we're riding bicycles 
 and so a lot of the hobbies that I have right now are centered around my children and also things that my wife and I like to do together 
 uh so personally a lot of the hobbies I had when I was growing up and uh going to college and so forth are having to change
 I really enjoyed uh mountain climbing 
 I really enjoyed skiing Uh and a lot of outdoor activities 
 Uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in Texas that I can go skiing with that right now 
 but hopefully I will be able to get back to the slopes some day 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 You didn't
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 That's true
 Oh yeah 
 I guess that for me it was very helpful 
 My two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing
 And so we went quite often 
 and uh in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing 
 When I lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago 
 and we would go skiing and enjoy that
 but uh luckily it's kind of unusual because hobbies it's a nice thing to have 
 and it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to Like you mentioned 
 and I am finding out a lot of the spare time that I had isn't there
 uh it's uh taken up by activities with uh work with family with uh civic and Church responsibilities for me
 So
