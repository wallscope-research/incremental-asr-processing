 Yeah
 Right 
 Right
 Yeah 
 I agree with that 
 I was fairly young at the time too 
 I really don't have very many memories about it at all in fact
 And uh my husband is a Vietnam veteran 
 and in looking at the Persian Gulf war that just went on he 
 it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the Vietnam vets did not have from the people or the administration either one
 Right 
 That's right 
 I mean they weren't there by choice 
 and 
 Right 
 Right 
 No 
 I don't think you can 
 and I agree with you that I think that the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in every aspect of it 
 and I agree with you also that I feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war 
 I mean they're still not settled over there
 And I have a feeling that the Persian Gulf crisis is going to be the same way
 I think we're going to end up back there in a few years if not sooner
 Uh-huh 
 I think it would too
 No 
 Yeah 
 I agree with that
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 you know you have to give Bush a lot of credit for he said that's what we were going there to do 
 and he did what he said 
 and he did pull out before it got any further than that where it would have turned into more of a police action Uh or more of a political action I guess you getting into their governmental affairs which you really can't do as another country
 I mean my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries 
 and we have so many problems here at home that we don't address
 That's right
 and that's what frustrates me more than anything
 Right
 I think there's a lot of waste 
 and they don't if they could just cut out all the fat and get it lean and start addressing some of the other issues 
 I think we could take care of everything And quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world you know who just end up using things against us later on anyway
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 a lot of good has come from this one
 And I guess in uh ironic way a lot of good came from the Vietnam war toward this war 
 because like we said earlier you know a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of that war 
 and 
 Right 
 exactly
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 no kidding
 And I just hate the emotional price a lot of the Vietnam people paid for you know nothing 
 I mean they still don't know what they were there for
 No 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Right 
 we- 
 the 
 when this war broke out it frustrated me all the antiwar people and you know all the demonstrations that were going on 
 I felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity 
 because I mean you know they're the kind of people who've always got to have a cause whether it's good bad of indifferent 
 They've got to have a cause 
 and you know nobody says because you're supporting the troops that you're supporting the war
 you have to support the people that are there
 And for some reason those people don't see that
 No 
 no 
 they don't 
 and you know they're just real shallow people
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I mean they're not helping anybody 
 that's the whole point
 they're not doing anything for anybody except themselves
 And I don't even know what they're doing for themselves You know
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 That's true 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 No 
 I guess not
 I know 
 we get cut off all the time too 
 Yeah 
 it is
 Thanks 
 same here
 Bye-bye
