 Okay 
 so you're into microwave cooking
 yes 
 and that's what we all are looking for isn't it 
 something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work
 I've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends so that I have leftovers all week
 Uh-huh
 I know 
 I try not to make too much 
 It's just my husband and I too
 and I try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week 
 but uh [ I usually + I usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or you know something like that or sometimes a roast 
 but 
 What's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party
 Oh oh
 Uh-huh
 Ooh 
 that sounds delicious
 Uh-huh
 I end up with an old stand-by that we call Russian chicken because it's so easy
 and uh it go- 
 you have to cook very little to go with it just some rice and some salad 
 and that's about it you know
 Uh you just take your boneless chicken breasts 
 and then you take and make a dressing out of uh Russian dressing one bottle of that and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix and three ounces of apricot preserves
 and you mix it up 
 and you just put it on the top of the chicken 
 and then I cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour
 and then I take the foil off and let it brown takes about another twenty minutes
 and it's delicious
 and it's so simple because I can pop it in when I come in the door you know and then uh go about my business 
 and by the time I've got everything else ready the chicken's done 
 So that's a real easy thing for me
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 No 
 I don't 
 my mom gets that 
 but 
 Really
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Um
 Oh my goodness
 Uh-huh
 Well I love cheese cake 
 I have never been I don't know the ones 
 I have not done that well with
 I like a baked cheese cake you know 
 I don't 
 I have had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it you know 
 but that's not the same as a New York style cheese cake 
 And uh the recipes that I've used 
 everybody will say Oh this is real simple 
 and then I make it 
 and it's really not very good
 but yours sounds good 
 I bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness
 Um Well that sounds interesting 
 so there's your good dessert for your dinner party
 Are you into serving wines with your dinner party
 Me either 
 I wish I knew more about it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 They would be if you just had time to do it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well how neat
 Uh-huh
 Um well I didn't even know they were offering that 
 I guess I 
 Uh-huh
 Oh well I bet that would be a fun thing to do
