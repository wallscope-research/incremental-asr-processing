 Uh basically they're just uh having various recycling uh bins uh located for uh trash pickup
 Well here they 
 uh live in an apartment complex
 And they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters 
 So a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because you know it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins
 Right 
 here they're trying to push through a bill 
 and a lot of people are against it 
 And it's going to create a lot more work for the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff 
 Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything
 Right 
 I think here uh instead of just you know requiring that you put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate
 Uh uh I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books 
 Uh usually have them come from you know projects to collect old ones 
 Usually just get dumped out with the trash 
 And phone books are a large volume of annual trash
 Well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper
 They contain the glue and stuff 
 and they used to have to take out all the uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them
 Now I think they've come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out
