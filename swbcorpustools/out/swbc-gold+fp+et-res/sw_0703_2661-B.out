 So eating out 
 What are you interested in in restaurants
 Uh once a week twice a week
 Yeah 
 I understand
 Uh but we both work 
 and we have a daughter 
 and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway
 Uh really I'm kind of open on food 
 I'm what you might call a culinary adventurer 
 I'll uh try anything once
 Been on a real barbecue kick lately
 Yeah
 Excuse me Uh yeah 
 we usually have Chinese once a month
 I hate franchised restaurants
 I despise franchised restaurants 
 I always prefer to go to something that seems more family run Uh some place where you seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost
 I don't 
 but I don't like something fake or put on either
 You know if I could have a good small restaurant or a good large restaurant I'd go to the good small restaurant
 And I don't know why that is 
 I think it's probably due to pricing often
 Well yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 It is what you look for
 Oh isn't 
 Uh I try to get my money's worth
 And not just that well that's a big part of it I try to get my money's worth You know and not just in quantity you know but quality and flavor and texture and care
 Well presentation's not always all of it either
 it's important
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 something a little extra
 and just for color if nothing else
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 What I miss up here is I'm originally a Texan and I miss home cooked Mexican
 Yeah 
 home cooked Tex-Mex
 Uh Mexican restaurants where it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation
 Yeah
 Well there's real Mexican food 
 and there's real Tex-Mex Mexican you know by third or fourth generation Americans of Hispanic heritage
 Oh yes 
 and there's big differences of course 
 and of course when you talk about Mexican cuisine that's kind of like talking about American food or Chinese food <> because <> its regional too
 So 
 Oh
 Uh yeah 
 that's the way it is here in Colorado also 
 No fresh or almost no fresh seafood
 and in Texas we got it from the Gulf
 And yeah 
 here a couple years ago my wife and I went to Seattle on vacation <> 
 And I think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week
 And it was <> 
 I was like a man starving at every meal
 It's a lot cheaper there isn't it 
 Lobster
 It's like shrimp on the Gulf
 Two ninety-eight a pound
 That's as cheap as steaks some places I mean in a grocery store
 Oh my gosh 
 I've got to go to Maine then <>
 You may have sold a trip for some time
 Uh it sounds wonderful 
 Uh so 
 That sound good 
 Uh down in the Gulf I've eaten a bunch of those little <> uh seafood shacks we've called them
 And uh it's just so much different than to eat something that's been frozen You know <>
 shrimp straight out of the bay
 Hm
 Was it true
 Hm
 Huh
 Uh yes 
 the cajuns
 they can do things to shrimp that no one else can
 So have you eaten crawfish yet
 Oh as with anything it's preparation
 Uh
 Uh-huh 
 It 
 there's all kinds
 So you do eat out a lot
 One of our other real problems with going out to eat Sunday morning brunches
 You know Sunday brunch all you can eat brunches
 Uh we still find it fun
 Well I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor
 And so 
 Yeah 
 uh actually one of our favorites is a chain Shoney's
 Yeah 
 <> in spite of the fact I've spoken so badly about chain restaurants uh we { F uh } do like Shoney's pretty well 
 but then there's a place up the pass up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to drive up to I think it's about eight thousand foot elevation and drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast
 it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning
 I think it's as much the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch {D 
 You know } and it's not that far 
 It's thirty miles
 Colorado Springs
 West
 west out of Colorado Springs
