 How about you 
 What do you do with your budget
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 That's true
 Yeah 
 that's sort of a problem
 we're trying to uh 
 so far we are in the clear credit wise 
 but uh the other side of it is 
 so not much on that side of it to add to it 
 We're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that 
 but 
 Yeah 
 we'd like to do that some day
 We have this dream
 But we don't know how long it will be a dream
 we're real happy that we don't have any debt 
 but at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this uh economy right now 
 so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month
 We're missionaries actually
 Yeah 
 uh-huh 
 And uh it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota
 and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here
 And it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home
 So 
 Africa 
 Nigeria
 Yeah
 About four years 
 We're career 
 so we go over seas for four years 
 and then we come back for a year 
 We go over four 
 we come back for a year
 Uh we're with Wycliff Bible Translators
 So 
 Yeah 
 they could very well 
 and 
 Uh we will be 
 I was over four years doing language surveying which is the first step 
 You're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need
 And uh came home and got married 
 and we will go back as translators cause we want to raise a family 
 and it is easier to raise a family as translators 
 Well I always wanted to do translation 
 but as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier 
 You know they really need surveyors cause you're free to travel anywhere 
 You don't have kids hanging around you and stuff
 Well I have a smattering of about ten different ones 
 but there's 
 I'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other you know 
 since I did you know complete a survey in one area I'd switch to the other 
 So I know the greetings in about ten and how to do market stuff 
 but in uh about five I guess I can do better in it 
 And my French is pretty good 
 but it's uh French 
 so uh I'm terrified to speak [ in + uh in France 
 Yeah 
 because they're real snobby about their language 
 and French is street French 
 and I just picked it up off the street 
 and I knew what I was communicating 
 but I didn't know what I was saying 
 I never sat there and got a direct translation 
 and said something here when I came home and French to somebody 
 and he paled and said uh I'm not going to tell you what you said 
 So since then I have refrained from speaking any French 
 So 
 In 
 I don't know what I said to him 
 but uh I didn't ask him either
