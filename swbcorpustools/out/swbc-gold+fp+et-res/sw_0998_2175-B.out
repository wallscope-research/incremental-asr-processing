 Okay
 I forgot all about that that it had to be pressed
 Um but anyway so so as far as 
 [ we don't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of T V because we both were raised you know that way you know where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a T V to be the baby-sitter
 And we just don't want that 
 We want more communication and interaction you know amongst us as a family 
 And we both like sports 
 so we figured well what better way to get out and you know be together as a family and also you know have it be good for you 
 And plus we both like to cook 
 so you know that's something we spend time together too is you know cooking and uh preparing meals and stuff 
 uh but that's about all we've discussed as far as for family 
 Oh my gosh
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 long way down the road right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well do you 
 so [ you go + [ if you're if you're ] not doing any kind of sport thing you go ] to one of your sisters' or brothers' sporting events And sort of like be there with them
 Yeah
 Well that's good too I mean as far as entering 
 I mean you're you're participating 
 but you're not you know
 I mean at least you're encouraging them on and stuff 
 and that's 
 because um even if our kids you know get into sports that we're really not interested in I want them you know to know that we're still there so to speak as a family
 Yeah 
 Cheering you on and stuff 
 Yeah 
 well that would be fun 
 Boy so you have a lot of experience as far as you know different ways a family can interact and do things together as far as 
 go- 
 twelve
 But it's 
 so if you're not 
 i- 
 what if 
 do people go off in their own little groups with that many 
 I mean did like some people go to their rooms and 
 Yeah
 Huh
 Yeah
 But when you were growing up and the younger ones weren't around what did you do
 Oh I see 
 But now that they've all sort of moved off 
 Yeah
 So do you think even 
 I mean what did you do when you were younger 
 did you go do the board games and stuff 
 you still did what you do now
 Uh-huh
 Hurling
 Oh hurtle 
 oh okay
 So you had a lot of games and things you played even when you were kids with the ones that you 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 not real spread in age
 Yeah
 Gosh twelve 
 is that pretty common up there uh in 
 Oh okay
 I mean I don't speak with many people that come from families that large any more 
 I mean my husband's mother came from a family of thirteen 
 but I mean that's his mother you know 
 and their Catholic 
 *[[they're]] and I mean that's 
 Well that's it then I think 
 probably maybe that 
 But I mean do you see yourself having thirteen kids or twelve kids
 Yeah
 Yeah
 But it's so expensive man
 I would think for your parents it would still be hard even nowadays I mean just to raise twelve kids
 Would be shoosh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well sometimes I think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though you know 
 I mean you don't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody
 so you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself if you really want it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Or manage money or know 
 yeah 
 know you know how to even go about getting money
 You know how to get a job or you know just when you get a job what your responsibility is
 Are you going to blow all that money 
 how easy it is to blow money you earn
 Uh-huh
 Wow you've really got responsibilities
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Wh- 
 So really I think sometimes there's an advantage 
 I mean sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent
 It makes you know that you can't take anything for granted that when you get something you're lucky to get it so to speak you know 
 So um I don't know 
 sometimes 
 but now it is hard I can imagine on your parents you know
