 My home 
 All right 
 my home is about fifteen years old
 It's a two story house 
 it's our first home 
 and it looks like it's going to be the last 
 I think we're going to demolish it 
 We've got two children 
 and it's 
 they have scraped the uh plaster off the walls you know with riding their little toys through it and stuff You know
 put dents in the tiles just multitude of them 
 I mean even places 
 it's past the dent stage 
 we're talking some of it's been peeled away you know 
 I don't know what they 
 Yeah 
 dents in the hole 
 right
 We've got two 
 one of them's eleven 
 and one of them's seven 
 and then the carpet you know 
 we need to replace the carpet 
 I mean it sounds like it's just the pits 
 but it's not all that bad I guess 
 but you know they're just real hard on it
 Definitely 
 I can see why people wait until they get like in high school or maybe junior high 
 and then they get another one
 I know there's a lot of them
 Yeah
 because they're always ruining something
 How old is your child
 Well 
 Some appliances breaking or something
 And you said you were in Colorado Springs
 Are there a lot of trailers around there
 And is that what you're in
 Well then that's why you're doing this then isn't it
 Oh okay 
 well 
 I'm not in T I
 I had a friend that had a roommate that worked for T I 
 and she saw this come up on the computer screen and ran it off And passed it to the people that were interested
 I know I've been talking to people in Ohio and uh Virginia and I think California
 Yeah 
 it is
 How does she get to work
 Uh-huh 
 I had a re- 
 and I wish we could down here
 Well sometimes 
 but I tell you I'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work 
 but if I did it it would take me an hour and fifteen minutes 
 I would have to get on one and drive or walk to a bu- you know 
 there's one terminal close to us 
 and then they'd drive me to the main terminal here
 then I'd have to go to downtown Dallas and then walk over couple blocks and get on another bus to go to my school
 So that's too much
 Yeah 
 but there sure are a lot of people that work down there
 Definitely 
 And I went down there a couple maybe three weeks ago for a trial 
 and I mean all these people were standing up that was you know during the workday all along the streets you know just all around these vacant buildings just a lot of vacant buildings 
 and they're just being demolished
 and they stink 
 and beer and wine bottles all over the place
 Uh-huh
 You know I think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand 
 It's gotten big
 I think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty something like that 
 And I didn't realize when I moved here that it was a separate town from Dallas 
 I know now 
 but I didn't
 I'm from Kilgore Texas 
 it's in east 
 Oh where you from
 Are you
 So why did you move up to Colorado
 Well it's real pretty up there 
 I have a friend in Denver
 What do you 
 What
 They're not owning homes period
 Uh-huh
 It wasn't such a bad idea
 So have you got uh land
 I did that one year 
 I lived with two other girls 
 and we all taught 
 And it was a two bedroom 
 so we took turns you know sharing the bedroom
 I got to where I decided I wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom 
 And then we had two baths 
 it was just the little bathroom were the thing that really bothered me because I felt real closed in
 That was in the seventies
 Uh-huh
 I'm sorry
 Uh-huh
 So Have you got it under 
 Are you required to by law
 We were down here
 Yeah 
 well I bet it's not bad
 Okay 
 but how much is yours 
 When we bought ours we were paying uh three hundred twenty-nine dollars
 For how many years
 Oh so it was still a lot cheaper
 so it was still a lot cheaper than what we gave because ours is thirty years 
 and we bought one of the cheapest houses you know a tract house
 Which probably didn't make much difference
 have a in it 
 In the price
 Gee nice huh 
 That sounds good
 So if the economy gets better are you going to get another house 
 No
 But you wouldn't take that mobile home 
 right
 You would
 It would be cheaper to move that than buy another one
 T I would pay to move you
 So how many years you been up there
 Do you snow ski
 It's real pretty 
 I went rock climbing one time
 my friend talked me in that 
 I'm a real um scaredy when it comes to heights 
 but once we got on top of the rocks it was quite
