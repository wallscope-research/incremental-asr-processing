 Okay 
 well what do you do on your yard
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Comes back in the yard
 so you don't have any one do your yard 
 You do it yourself
 Yeah 
 we do too
 Isn't that the truth 
 A flyer's on every door every day
 That's right 
 Well my husband does the same thing 
 he does the yard 
 and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower 
 but I keep putting off learning
 That's right 
 But I had recently gone out and planted mums 
 We had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago 
 and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway's
 and put out yellow and bronze 
 and they're just gorgeous and so then last week my mom comes in town 
 and she says Well those are going to die just the first frost
 She said You should have done pansies 
 And I went Well now you tell me
 So the first night that around Halloween 
 and we went out and covered them with a sheet 
 and they did okay that first night 
 But the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it 
 so I guess I've lost them 
 I haven't gone out to check yet
 No 
 listen 
 but um the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here 
 I guess it was about four years ago 
 And we did not know in August to put down the uh whatever it is for grub worms
 And the next spring I guess in that March every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed we'd have big whole patches come up 
 Have you ever seen it what grub worms do
 And we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it 
 it would just come off in the rake down to the dirt 
 So we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything 
 It took a lot of money and a lot of time 
 so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazinon
 Oh yeah 
 we found them
 yeah 
 we found them 
 We dug under there about an inch 
 and you could see them 
 They're real fat little white things 
 and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring
 yeah 
 but in the 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 June bugs is what I'd heard them called
 so any how occasionally I find them in the flower beds 
 They said that every yard has some
 but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem 
 So that's the number one thing we do whether we fertilize or anything else just because we got burned so badly before
 Oh yeah 
 that too 
 two years ago or last Christmas is that what you're talking about
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 I guess you did too 
 It's what they've done in the spring or the fall
 Yeah 
 because I started to say there's different times they say it's okay to do it
 Yeah
 Yeah
 keep it damp 
 Well my 
 out here you know we don't have as many trees in Plano 
 at least the area where 
 we're over by Collin Creek Mall 
 but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front like the pittosporum all died 
 and all those variegated uh things died 
 So we pretty much go with that dwarf Yaupon and that Yaupon holly 
 and they just live
 Yeah 
 you can stand those
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well it's kind of like one of these 
 Same way 
 uh-huh 
 they warned me of that one finally 
 And I said You know you need to either read Neal Sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery because lot of places are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there 
 and we didn't know the difference 
 And every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before Like about these mums
 Okay 
 next year I'll do pansies
 And my backyard we had it really nice 
 and then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy 
 and so it was about 
 I guess he's three now 
 so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio
 So it's like our backyard is just kind of like 
 as long as he won't damage it fine 
 and if there's anything he'll hurt we just don't put it out there any more
 Uh-huh 
 Very much 
 but uh 
 You did
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 So do ours 
 yeah
 What did you grow
 That is amazing
 Yeah
 Well put them in a salad though 
 and you say well I made it though at least it's mine
