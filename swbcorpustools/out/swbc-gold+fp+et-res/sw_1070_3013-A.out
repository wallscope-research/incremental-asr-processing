 All right 
 what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 Oh yeah 
 You serve it cold
 Oh yeah 
 that sounds good
 Um
 Yeah 
 Usually when we entertain we do something really simple because I like to visit with my company and not be scurrying around in the kitchen 
 so a lot of times we'll barbecue 
 like uh for Memorial Day we had some friends over 
 and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's meat marinate and put it on the smoker and cooked it
 And it was real good 
 You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way 
 and then people think they're eating steak or something 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 It really does
 I don't usually just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it seems like most people like spaghetti
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference in your whole house
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Most 
 we don't entertain like people from work or stuff often 
 It's usually friends from church and stuff
 and it's usually kind of like you want to come over and they say well what can we bring
 And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things 
 and everybody else brings something
 Oh yeah 
 yeah
 It's a lot more relaxing 
 I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to you know put on this really fancy dinner for someone
 Huh-uh
 Yeah 
 w- 
 Yeah 
 Do you work
 Do you stay home with kids
 Yeah 
 I've been working 
 we're going to have a baby this summer 
 and I'm not going to work anymore
 Yeah 
 So hopefully I think I'll enjoy cooking more when I don't have to work all day 
 I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up 
 and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night 
 so 
 Yeah
 Eat at six yeah
 Oh that's good
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's neat
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that really is 
 It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other
 Right now we eat in front of the T V 
 but since it's just the two of us it's 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 to see what's happening
 Oh uh-huh
 Oh I've seen those in the magazines
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 yeah 
 we like that
 that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too
 Oh neat
 Oh wow that's great 
 How old is he
 Eleven 
 wow that's good
 Do like you cook a breakfast every morning 
 or 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh uh-huh 
 yeah
 Oh do they get rubbery 
 or 
 I've never tried it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 We had 
 my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash 
 Everybody would say we don't like squash we won't eat squash 
 so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there you know
 and then we'd go oh this is really good
