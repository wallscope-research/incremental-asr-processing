 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 what do you think about it
 Yeah 
 yeah
 I agree you know 
 I 
 Yeah 
 oh I do too 
 I do too
 They ought to get it for killing a civilian just as easily as a policeman
 Yeah 
 I agree 
 Uh I heard something on the news the other night they were talking about uh oh I know what it was 
 it was in our little Lewisville paper that comes out twice a week on the front page every week uh 
 there's a little thing at the bottom 
 it's like a call in survey that says you know do you think so 
 and then you call this number 
 and you press like one for yes and two for no
 And one of the questions the other day this last paper and I haven't seen the results of it I'm anxious to was do you think that um capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers Which I thought was a real interesting question 
 No 
 I didn't 
 huh-uh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 You know I think that's what it's going to take though
 I really do 
 Oh yeah 
 it's going to take uh you know 
 the police I don't think can do it alone you know
 uh it's going to take all of us getting together 
 I'm sorry I'm trying to 
 my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed 
 It's going to take all of us you know getting together and just saying we are not going to take it any more
 That's right 
 that's right
 Uh-huh
 Uh
 That's right 
 that's right uh
 Oh my gosh 
 The only thing about the death penalty I know that they try to be careful 
 and they try to be sure 
 but these people are on death row for like twenty years you know
 An- you know 
 if you know 
 I think you know being convicted is one thing you know 
 and that's great if they're sentenced to death 
 to me you could not sentence them to death unless the case was for sure 
 I mean it ha- 
 Right 
 right 
 by the time it gets there 
 and they've been convicted 
 and then they've been sentenced to death 
 they're sure 
 I mean there's no doubt 
 I mean 
 there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind 
 there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty
 So once they've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt do it you know 
 just 
 I guess I mean that sounds cold 
 but gosh you know you know we're keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row and not doing anything with them 
 and it's costing us a heck of a lot of money 
 and that's terrible to look at it that way 
 but 
 if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death then do it you know uh
 I didn't notice it 
 huh-uh
 Gosh 
 yeah
 Oh man
 Yeah 
 and those kind of people I'm sorry you don't reform them you know
 I really beli- 
 you don't
 If they're the kind of people that commit these excuse me grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again you don't reform those kind of people
 No 
 no 
 and I don't know 
 the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas you know
 Well if you're insane enough that you can go cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard then [ can you be helped you know 
 I have my doubts you know
 you know I don't know 
 I think there's a point 
 some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do it just gets out of hand
 and I understand you know that you know 
 my husband and I 
 No
 No 
 huh-uh
 Oh really
 Yeah
 Oh really
 Yeah
 We've had several here lately 
 and it 
 there were several of them in North Dallas 
 and then it started kind of happening a couple of places in South Dallas 
 and that's maybe what you were talking about 
 Men breaking in uh to houses and taking or a man 
 they think it's the same person taking uh little girls right straight out of their beds at night And you know breaking in obviously watching them in the house because they're breaking into the right window you know the little girls bedroom And taking them out putting them in a car and driving them out and taking them out and molesting them and then bringing them back and throwing them back in their own front yards
 Yes 
 that is happened
 I think there's been like six or seven of them over the last like probably eight or nine months
 They don't kill them 
 no
 They've tak- 
 and they're all like um like anywhere from nine to twelve years old I think is what they've been
 And he's taken them and raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard
 Oh can you imagine because it happens in the middle of the night 
 so you know these parents didn't know the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming let me in
 You know can you imagine
 Shoo- you know I've got one of those in Brian's room
 I never even thought about that 
 God maybe I'll take it out
 I hadn't even thought about it 
 That's terrible
 Well it's really bad that you have to be you know 
 we were over at a neighbors tonight 
 and my little boy is just a little over two 
 and their little boy is like five you know 
 so there's a big difference
 and they were playing in the back yard 
 and we were getting ready to leave 
 and I went out in the back yard to get Brian 
 and the boys were gone 
 and the back fence was open
 you know
 And she didn't act like it bothered her at all oh 
 this happens all the time 
 And we walked through the fence out the alleys come to the back of the house you know
 and I looked down both directions of the alley 
 and I saw neither one of them 
 uh And she was like oh God he does this all the time you know where are you <> you know screaming J D 
 And you know my heart was in my throat you know 
 and uh Brian was two houses down You know 
 and he you know 
 I don't know
 Parents around here just let their kids run everywhere 
 and I just can't do that
 Oh man this is too scary that is just too scary 
 You know I let Brian play here in the back yard 
 and there's two gates that go into the back yard 
 and we've got one of those big eight foot privacy fences
 And one of the gates has a padlock on it 
 and then the other gate just has one of those slide bar things 
 but it's on the inside
 it's 
 you know they'd have to come over the fence 
 they could not open a gate you know
 And I still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there
 You know I mean if I don't hear him playing I mean I get up and come out and look out the window real often you know 
 so 
 It's really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids 
 but I mean you do 
 better safe than sorry
 He could fry
 Yes 
 to put it very bluntly he could fry
 yes 
 yes 
 Because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder
 You know
 and I believe that 
 and this is one of them
 Because these little girls will never be the same
 Never be the same 
 so I don't know 
 it's really scary 
 and I don't know what needs to be done you know 
 it seems like there's no room in jails to put them in jail 
 and when they do put them in there you know 
 I'm taking a business law class at night 
 and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney 
 so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases you know 
 and he said you know you know you're not told this but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess whatever you sentence them to 
 they're going to serve about a quarter
 they'll serve a quarter of it
 so if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years don't sentence them to fifteen years sentence them to a hundred
 You know because then they'll serve fifteen or twenty so Which is really 
 I don't know
 No 
 it doesn't 
 They just get out you know 
 there was a thing on 
 I don't know
 That's the thing 
 we're just going to have to adopt a completely different attitude
 and we're going to have to say if you commit this crime and if we're sure you commit this crime you are going to be sentenced to death period period 
 and do it you know
 And if you commit this crime you will be in prison for the rest of your life
 We're not going to say we're going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years 
 we're really going to do it you know
 It's just the system has just 
 and I understand they're doing it because the prisons are full 
 but somewhere we've got to come up with some money to build more you know and keep these people in them you know
 Well I was watching a show about this the other night 
 and you know they were like I think it was on FORTY-EIGHT HOURS
