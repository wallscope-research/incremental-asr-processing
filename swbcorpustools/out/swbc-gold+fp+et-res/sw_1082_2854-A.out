 Well we're just starting a family through adoption 
 so I don't really have a lot of uh concrete uh opinions 
 Just what I know out of my peer group uh has gone through 
 And none of it has been good 
 Yeah 
 Uh the ones that can afford to have live-in nannies They seem to be having an okay time
 Uh but a lot of the other ones that have are professional uh 
 I'd say fifty percent of you know my peers in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're you know going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade
 Uh but I 
 there must be some good service out there if you really look and pay for it
 In terms of what they're talking about
 Oh 
 Infant Uh 
 Infant 
 Yeah 
 After eleven years of marriage Yeah we are 
 actually it's happening now 
 So we're just going through the process
 So and actually the question is uh very appropriate 
 Cause I'm not sure uh how strong the maternal instinct is going to be 
 They tell me it's going to be strong 
 Do you have children
 And did you put him in daycare 
 or is he older now or younger 
 or 
 Sure 
 So he's out of daycare 
 You 
 uh-huh 
 Oh
 Flex 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Oh that's wonderful
 Right
 That's wonderful 
 Yeah 
 and I guess uh because of um your uh profession 
 I mean uh I'm in corporate communications 
 But I've done free-lance writing in the past
 so what we're hoping is that uh 
 I mean my husband thinks I can do it 
 I've just never worked out of a domestic base you know 
 I've always been in a corporate uh environment 
 Uh but I'm hoping that possibly I can do something where I can go flextime or part-time 
 or if they don't have that uh 
 my boss 
 I'm very lucky though again too my boss is very akin to family building 
 So I think that's th- something that couples need in going into this
 Uh I don't know 
 I do think there's good daycare out there 
 What part of the country are you in
 You're in Maryland 
 Right 
 That's what I'm hoping
 Uh-huh
 Oh my goodness 
 You were fortunate 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 So I mean do you think that that was in a way though good objectivity that that doesn't really 
 that's not a correct English 
 but you know in a sense you see what I'm saying though 
 From a mother's standpoint I mean in a way it was quote and unquote good objectivity 
 Uh-huh
 See 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Right 
 And then he also learned that uh there were times that you had to be gone so you probably minimized 
 well uh we're getting ready 
 I mean you're far enough away now I can tell you since this is locally I make sure we're going to Romania in a few weeks
 And that's uh just 
 Romania 
 As in like what Twenty Twenty and uh but we're real excited because we've just developed a contact Through professional people 
 and it's private 
 and it's hospital 
 we're just very excited 
 Uh And what's the word I'm looking for 
 When you deal with issues like that uh in terms of family building through adoption uh and then you have people responding to you well if you go through that why would you put them in daycare
 Uh issues are being raised prematurely in my mind 
 But I guess they're not because it's something I'll have to deal with sooner than later 
 Uh and what I've learned to do is just tune out everybody's opinion 
 I feel that if the child is healthy uh and as long as we make it feel secure I'd love to do something like with what you did
 Uh I don't think I could be dumper where I could take it from you know eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there
 Uh maybe after two or three years old 
 I don't know Um
 Yeah 
 Well they need a schedule I think 
 I don't think the United States 
 what country were you uh in Europe when you were uh uh 
 Uh that's 
 Well that's the same thing 
 I mean I don't know how they are there 
 but uh in eastern Europe 
 my stepfather's from England 
 it just seems the United States does not provide for either child care or elder care as I call it
 Uh and we're just not set up for that 
 Uh with the 
 Go ahead
 Uh-huh
 See I think that's wonderful
 To 
 Right
 We cast off 
 Right 
 right 
 Th- 
 I'm that way 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 It's easier 
 and I agree with that 
 That's why I y- you know 
 what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown 
 but you can probably empathize with this 
 It's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts 
 In terms of what to do Uh 
 and I just don't think there is a good daycare system 
 Uh my company I'm particularly fortunate that they're in tune with that 
 But I've been at companies where uh you know the trend is or the definite mood is well we made conscious decisions not to have children
 You know 
 And in 
 and a couple like us building through adoption there it's almost radical to some people
 And what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out 
 and uh I respect there are some women that I know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that you know they may have the need for child care like that
 But I agree with you that it's just I call it dumping 
 I 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Then yeah 
 it's in tandem then
 I just uh 
 and there are trade-offs too I think 
 One of the things that is a problem is uh in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers
 Uh it's just you know it's so low 
 but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis it's prohibitive 
 And some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year uh 
 Really 
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh 
 And they 
 yeah 
 I haven't thought about that 
 Yeah 
 And actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old 
 and she's at home part-time paralegal 
 So I'm thinking um 
 And we get along fantastically 
 so I'm thinking you know 
 And that's the way you have to uh 
 how wa- 
 I'm just real curious 
 How was the Middle East in terms of that with children 
 is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh really 
 He must be smart 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 The professional 
 Yeah 
 I was wondering about that 
 Uh there 
 I'm in Dallas 
 and there was just a very big uh series about Moslem women 
 and there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts 
 I'm digressing here 
 but uh I was just real curious when you said Middle East if you didn't mind me asking
 Oh no 
 that's okay 
 Well even if you did that's okay actually 
 I think 
 Right 
 Right 
 They fight 
 they work
