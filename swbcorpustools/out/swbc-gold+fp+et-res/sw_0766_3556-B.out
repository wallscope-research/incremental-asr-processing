 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well okay uh 
 most of the uh commercial television these days I'm just a little bit sick of 
 Uh in fact I don't watch hardly any uh television at all with uh my other activities 
 Uh between my family and my church et cetera et cetera well I hardly any time to sit down and watch the news 
 Now I do watch the Discover channel and some on channel thirteen 
 but uh aside from that I pretty well uh turn it off
 Uh-huh
 I don't blame you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well it 
 sometimes if it's real good 
 like there's been more than one evening that I've uh caught uh every animal show that evening on uh on the Discover channel
 And uh because you know they're documentaries and they're 
 Oh you bet 
 in fact I'm glad that it's part of our uh basic cable package
 But uh 
 Uh-huh

 Uh-huh 
 and they're in the playoffs 
 and I'm not sure that the Eagles are not
 I did
 Yeah

 Did you know everybody or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson 
 but uh uh he's brought the pokes uh from a one and something team to uh playoffs in what three years now
 Uh-huh 
 well uh you know it was the time for the passing of the guard I mean
 And I think Tom knew it
 So uh 
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 and I wouldn't have blamed him one bit because 
 yeah 
 but see nobody remembers him as a loser because he's far too much of a gentleman and a practicing Christian uh to ever be thought of as anything you know but a winner 
 Yeah
 Oh he is

 because he has to like himself before he can like other people Uh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Oh he will
 Right 
 Well nobody's going to forget Tom Landry
 Shoot come now 
 I mean I'd not a

 Huh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh goodness
 Well well we're finished with all but the last one and trying to get him through his technical school

 so 
 You know we're not staying on the topic of television shows 
 but I'm really not too concerned
