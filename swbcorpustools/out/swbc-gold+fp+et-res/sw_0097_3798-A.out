 I mean I 
 go ahead
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I mean I can see that research is needed 
 and you know 
 Definitely 
 I mean it's becoming a major problem

 it's uh abstinence in certain cases

 I've heard you know uh different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough 
 and Mostly that's what I've heard 
 so I don't know
 And yet I know uh it sounds like big money to me 
 But it probably takes a lot
