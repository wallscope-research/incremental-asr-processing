 Well since I'm kind of on the older side you know I just feel like uh when I start talking about benefits I'm concerned about medical benefits 
 Uh uh my husband works for McDonald Douglas 
 and so his medical benefits are so excellent you know 
 that's really great
 You know I work for uh a bank Western Financial 
 And uh they don't let me know really about anything that's going on 
 Even some of the immediate things that I need to know I don't know it until the next hour 
 and all of a sudden we know we've got changes made 
 We're changing departments 
 We're changing policies 
 We're changing doing other kinds of things Which to me is disturbing 
 I mean I feel like if I don't necessarily need to uh be involved since I'm pretty much on a low level 
 you are right there 
 You know I'm pretty much on a low level as far as uh the company is concerned 
 But I do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening 
 and I think I can be a better and more effective employee if I had a little bit more information along that line 
 Oh my gosh
 Uh-huh 
 Oh
 And it 
 Yeah 
 that is interesting
 Exactly
 A- 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 I know 
 it seems to be kind of scary you know Because you think of 
 uh see my son's eighteen right now 
 and uh he wants to go into engineering 
 And the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open 
 and he's interested in basically three different areas 
 But uh it's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that 
 He needs to do his own course of investigation and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years
 And in thirty years it becomes pretty critical 
 I mean my uh brother-in-law uh I mean he's sixty 
 He's not ready to retire 
 but his company uh is uh closing up
 And because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff And all the nuclear and stuff which is what he was working on He's getting cut back 
 and he's not ready to retire
