 Oh so 
 Well it 
 let's put it this way 
 We've got the New England Patriots up here 
 so 
 They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years
 Yeah
 Um well uh partly due to ownership 
 You know uh Victor Kiam owned uh the Patriots uh for a period of a number of years 
 and he always had uh this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something 
 and uh they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth 
 And it recently was sold to uh some other people 
 so hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and uh keep uh the Patriots in the New England area anyways 
 Oh yeah 
 I've been to a few games before
 Now you're from Texas
 So you've got two football teams down there
 Uh-huh
 Oh I see 
 There's that type of segregation huh 
 Wow 
 Uh-huh
 Do you 
 Uh-huh
 Do you follow professional sports at all
 Yeah 
 Well it's a good past time you know 
 Particularly football 
 They say uh football attracts more men because of the physical aggression on the field 
 and supposedly psychologists say uh that uh men take out their frustrations by watching football 
 and you know they get together with a bunch of guys 
 uh uh and they have a good time and everything 
 and that's suppose to be some of uh the male bonding and the uh the male instincts I guess or something about the uh 
 Well no 
 it's good in terms uh of a contest
 I think that uh 
 I personally like hockey better because it's a contact sport 
 It has the speed
 And the hand eye coordination 
 and it takes a certain skill to play hockey 
 Not everybody can play hockey
 So we 
 and 
 that's 
 we're a big hockey area up here 
 I bet up here in New England as well as you know in the Minnesota area 
 but 
 What hockey
 No 
 there's no hockey 
 there's no 
 There's no professional hockey teams in Texas 
 Yeah 
 I think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now 
 Like they have this World Football League 
 You see we have the N F L that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams 
 There are those teams that play in professional National Football League 
 but uh now they have what's called the World Football League 
 and they have all these teams from 
 there's a team in London 
 and there's uh other European teams 
 and there's teams in the United States 
 and they're playing now during the summer months 
 and it's really you know overkill 
 And there's only so much football you can watch
 Yeah 
 that's good 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Now have you ever been to a professional football game
 Have you 
 Did you do the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole 
 Well see now see that's what you got to do see 
 Now we talked our 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 You the 
 well the same thing
 we talked our wives 
 there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games 
 And uh we talked our wives into going with us one time 
 and they had a real good time 
 and it was basically for the social atmosphere
 You go you know three or four hours before the game 
 You go set up 
 We set a table up 
 we do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more 
 but that whole 
 it's not so much sure the contest itself and the game itself 
 but it's the whole atmosphere of playing uh of going to a game *[[slash error]] I- 
 that you miss sitting home in your parlor you know uh with a six pack of beer and some uh potato chips you know 
 you miss that
 and any professional sport I think you miss that
 The atmosphere of being there you know 
 Yep 
 Well foot-
