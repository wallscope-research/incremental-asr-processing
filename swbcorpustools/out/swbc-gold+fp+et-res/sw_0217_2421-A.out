 Okay 
 So uh what do you think about it
 Privacy
 Right
 Well there is always uh the possibility even remote as it is uh of 
 Yeah
 And see that bothers me 
 I'm very much for drug testing
 uh I really am 
 I mean I'm going to take the negative side just for a second just to do it 
 Um see I have to take uh medication for kidney transplant
 And I'm going to be taking that the rest of my life 
 Now you 
 I don't know how that's going to affect uh
 Right
 I mean I haven't had one yet 
 Um T I 
 I work for Texas Instruments
 and uh you know we do have the random drug testing 
 but I've missed it so far 
 But I mean in the back of my mind it always bothers me 
 And what happens if they catch it 
 they think that you know I'm on drugs 
 and they send me and have me uh you know go through this thing you know 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Well like I said I'm very much pro testing um 
 and this is why
 Uh number one is I'm kind of 
 I know this sounds like a slogan for the government 
 but you know we are in a war against drugs 
 I mean it's horrible 
 I mean you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not
 and it takes some drastic steps at this point 
 And I think personally the drastic step has to be um that you can't work if you continue taking drugs
 I mean it's as simple as that 
 I mean uh ma- not necessarily difficult 
 but make it so that it's not glamorous
 I mean it's glamorous taking drugs 
 or at least it seems that way
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well then 
 let's answer the second half of the question 
 What limits ought to be put on it do you think
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Treatment before for dismissal type thing
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Personally I think that's what I was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested
 It you know 
 That it could happen
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well there's going to be some measure of incentive uh reward or whatever 
 but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want
 So I've got to agree with that
 So um 
 Um
 Yeah 
 I think so
 I think we did pretty good
 Well all right 
 well uh I guess that's about it
 All right
 it was nice talking to you too
 All right 
 bye-bye
