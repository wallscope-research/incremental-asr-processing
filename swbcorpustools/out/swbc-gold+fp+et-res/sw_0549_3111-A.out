 Well it depends where in Dallas you are
 There are certainly parts of town I would not want to live in
 Because it's the situation 
 it is very location dependent
 and there are parts of town here where when they talk about the nightly gunfire 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 what they call the latchkey children
 Yeah 
 sort of on my end is more of the upper middle class 
 so I think our uh 
 not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems 
 but on the other hand uh we get the uh affect of uh the city 
 and uh the main crimes within the suburb here are the theft crimes A small number of assaults 
 uh well if we have one murder a year that's probably as many 
 but then you know you go into Dallas and they are unfortunately uh having murders at a rate greater than one a day
 Uh-huh
 Well the thing is I don't 
 it's one of those things where if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on 
 Unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like uh wherever there are more uh criminals there are more policemen
 but that's which came first
 But on the other side of it is 
 basically the problem is in the society and the society's views 
 and well uh since now I'm in my mid-forties when I was in grad school or when I was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area I thought you know crime was reasonably unknown and just the situation that's developed with the drug *[[new slash unit]] aspect of uh uh the pushers the dealers and the addicts uh
 Because it just was not uh something back in the sixties that uh I even had to worry about 
 But I think you know that there is a lot in the society where things have changed 
 uh so it's effected all of us
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 You know in a sense I have real mixed feelings on that
 because it comes a bit from the angle that the uh uh 
 it would certainly be an interesting test
 but the other side of it to me 
 Uh y- 
 well the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side 
 and I think if I look back fifty or a hundred years I'd say you know back then there were the opium dens
 but the thing is if somebody ruined their life uh society didn't try to then save themselves from it 
 they let this person who had ruined it uh well die or whatever 
 I mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that their life expectancy was real short 
 but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise 
 we need to take care of people even if they have you know physically ruined themselves
 Yeah
 and so to me that's 
 uh I would certainly like to see a real test of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then don't use them
 Uh *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well some of that 
 and of course I'm a baby of the old school
 but it bothers me from the fifties on 
 not that I'd remember that much from the fifties 
 but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality
 And so they 
 in the 
 there were the sixty-four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties 
 but nowadays there's so much on TV where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing 
 Of course uh I work for lawyers a lot 
 and I see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and you know there's a million dollars you can have uh for mental duress or whatever
 But you know the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the uh 
 in Europe they seem to have mentality 
 and drunk driving is a good one 
 is that people are well indoctrinated in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable
 And yeah 
 if you're going to drink and you may drink you better have your designated driver
 In this country and for example with alcohol or with drugs we don't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say it is okay under these circumstances but if you step outside these bounds the punishment is extreme *[[slash error]] And we mean it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 But that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving was uh misplaced for years
 you know it was an acceptable social behavior
 what does your city have for gun control if anything
