 I certainly do 
 Uh I think we have a lousy school system 
 And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we don't train our teachers very well 
 And then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents 
 And then oh uh we put too much uh responsibility on the teachers for things that are really not education 
 They're social services
 Well as a matter of fact I just finished editing a book on the topic 
 So I have some rather strong opinions
 and I'm sure they're colored by what I've edited
 Yes 
 I do 
 And I was not very happy with the results
 Well I think I would start with getting rid of about two-thirds of the administrators And all the auxiliary personnel The school bureaucracy that exists mainly to perpetuate itself
 And then I would uh use the money that we've paying them to uh provide some special help in training and particularly uh mentor teachers to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time 
 And then let them try some innovative things and see what works And then uh have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who could benefit from the same sorts of things And then from the parents side have the parents support the school Get involved 
 Pay attention to what's happening Talk to the teachers Uh talk to their kids about school And support the institution 
 and a- 
 instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that uh the teacher's in the middle 
 Well I've done about all I can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people
 Oh well That I'm not so sure about 
 I've got a lot of things to keep me busy
 Have you done anything like that 
 Anything political
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's more than a lot 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think that's absolutely right 
 They 
 the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board you're going to be uh rewarding people who've been doing a lousy job instead of getting the uh improvement that we want
 So we'd have to have some way to uh reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 it's hard to tell 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Now that's a very good suggestion
 Yeah 
 I don't think student teaching is enough 
 I think that at least what I used to observe in student teaching was that some college kid who might not be all that bright to begin with was thrown into a class room with a teacher who was harried and overworked and uh had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions to pay much attention to the student teacher 
 And then the student teacher didn't stay but about six weeks
 So there really was no time to try much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the student teacher improve very much
 There are lots of things that could be done in that line including things like video taping Because it wouldn't be hard with all the electronic equipment that's around these days to video tape uh either a master teacher teaching a class so that then students could watch that and uh criticize the methods used and analyze it Figure out what worked and what didn't work
 And then also to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance 
 Huh 
 I don't think that's going to work
 Yeah 
 Well another thing I think would be helpful would be to have some sort of say a national curriculum Because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for uh curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in Texas and California 
 And then everybody else is stuck with that regardless of what they want to teach
 Because it 
 Well that's the two states that adopt on a state wide basis
 Uh and so it uh 
 I used to work for a textbook publisher 
 and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by Texas then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject 
 and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted in the individual school districts
 And you know a third of the Texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks
 And then the states that either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids just have to follow along and take what Texas gets
 California is the biggest for elementary schools 
 but Texas uh adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade
 Yep 
 Sure is
 And I hope maybe we're going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with uh Reagan's uh new education secretary uh you know uh trying to produce some new programs anyway
 Excuse me
 I have got to go 
 I've got another line calling 
 Thanks
 Bye
