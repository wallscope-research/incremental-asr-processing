 Women
 Oh okay 
 that's not a broad enough topic 
 I'm ready when you are
 Okay
 Yeah 
 I'm here
 That's okay
 Okay 
 um I don't know 
 are you in your thirties 
 or 
 Oh okay
 Well then I can tell you that roles have changed 
 I'm thirty-eight 
 and they changed quite a bit
 Um I 
 this was my twentieth high school reunion in Chicago
 And basically um the choices I mean you know 
 you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that
 That's kind of um the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies
 It was sort of just to um go protest
 and uh just everybody be damned and live with some one 
 and you know social morals were a little bit lacking
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 it was more civil rights oriented or race oriented rather than gender based 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 It did 
 It did 
 and some of the other stuff that um I think that changed it uh when I first got out of college fifteen years ago they were always saying well if you were assertive you were a libber 
 or you were aggressive not assertive and independent
 And in terms of the corporate community I've seen a big change in terms of men finally being quote unquote used to women who are in uh controlling positions in the corporate hierarchy
 So I think that's good
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 The mainstay 
 yeah 
 and restructuring stepfamilies 
 yeah 
 Right 
 the schools or the parents 
 yeah
 Um I'm trying to think of what else 
 I have a lot of opinions on this except all of a sudden I went blank 
 A lot of the things um the demographics do 
 I mean there are more 
 I don't have the numbers in my head right now 
 but a lot of the things that brought feminism I mean there are just more women in the demographics just generally in the United States in terms of being 
 I mean I'm the typical baby boomer 
 I hate that term
 but in terms of women going out I mean twenty-three I remember that
 What's it like to be twenty-three as a woman today 
 I mean when I was twenty-three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married
 um those were the general issues
 Uh-huh 
 He was ancient 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 You didn't know what you're going to be missing
 I don't have any either 
 and I've been a married for eleven years 
 so 
 Yeah 
 when it's time 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 you want to establish 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of um women don't feel like they need to get married anymore
 I was twenty-seven when I got married 
 and I just at the time um 
 my husband actually even jokes about it
 He was twenty-three when we met 
 an I was at a point where it was like I didn't date 
 I mean I just went out to have a good time
 but I didn't have to have male companionship
 Um and a lot of the um friends that I had in school at that point who had gone back and gone to law school or M B A programs um which I also had done you know they were very sad 
 But then by the time I got married um it seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage track
 So I guess that's a big change in terms of just um the attachments that women feel like they need to have the dependency their self-identity is stronger
 Yeah 
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 and I mean I don't know how old your mom is 
 she's probably 
 let's see my mother's in her early sixties 
 so 
 Okay 
 I'm thirty-eight 
 your mother's for- 
 I just turned thirty-eight
 Um yes 
 I'm laughing 
 oh my God 
 It does start to creep up
 No 
 um but it's okay 
 don't ever let age 
 I mean I don't thi- 
 nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 an 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 you are because what I was going to say is what you will find is my background is in journalism and corporate communications
 and what you'll find is 
 I mean I'm just now finally to a point where 
 I mean I don't know why I didn't do it sooner
 but this is probably typical of the women's movement too is the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway if you want to go back to school 
 I'm seriously considering going back to school for law Um which is a complete I wouldn't say career change it's a subway 
 but it's still is a different application 
 And I mean if you think about it you know I still can have another career 
 I mean I've worked for over fifteen years in what I've done
 And I mean so when you're saying quick um I think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine is thinking that um they have to do everyth- you know sort of I call it a chewing syndrome 
 They have to eat real fast 
 they have rapidity of speech 
 they have to just go through everything
 And you'll find that probably by the time your twenty-eight thirty if you haven't slowed down something will slow you down 
 Do you know what I'm saying
 Um because it's just you find out that you're really not um smelling the roses 
 and I know that sounds trite and all that
 Uh-huh 
 Oh it is 
 That's right 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh you're not 
 no 
 No 
 That's true 
 I mean it's 
 No 
 you're extremely 
 yeah 
 it's ju- 
 Well it's like us we're getting ready to do if possible for an adoption 
 and I have friends that say well why would you do that if you know you haven't been able to children which we do know why would you do that now at this point 
 and um it's just individual choices
 I stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had um 
 in my family my brother's children 
 I mean he just turned forty 
 his children will be out of high school before he's forty-five
 Um I mean that's like your mother 
 look how young she is compared to where you are out of school and everything
 It's just it 
 but what you find is you don't compare the woman because you just get into trouble 
 It's all independent and choices
 Um but what I was going to say about mothers is uh your mother probably just won't say it 
 but I mean my mother and her sisters are always saying uh to my cousins and I my female cousins you girls are so lucky because quote unquote you have all these choices you know 
 you went to school
 you can do this 
 you can do that
 we couldn't do that then 
 And my cousins and I go well why couldn't you 
 Uh-huh 
 And that's normal 
 I mean I think that's the world today
 Right 
 that's exa- 
 Yeah 
 I mean What I'm right now
 I'm a free-lance writer right now
 And then um what I'm doing is working at um an electronics company for their company newspaper right now on the side 
 and then I'm also 
 actually I'm excited tomorrow I have a uh luncheon appointment with a perspective client to do uh marketing communications for them
 Oh you are 
 We- 
 Here's what you shoul- 
 d- 
 this is off the topic 
 and those people probably won- 
 Did you go to Baylor by any chance
 Oh okay 
 that's even better 
 I went to 
 or you in radio or television or news
 Uh my journalism degree is in
