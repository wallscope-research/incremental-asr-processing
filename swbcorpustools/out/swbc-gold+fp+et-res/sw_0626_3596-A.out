 Oh yes 
 very appropriate I guess 
 Uh you ready for this
 Okay John 
 just a moment 
 Well guess what 
 we get to talk about the weather 
 Uh-huh
 Oh you do
 so you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather 
 I imagine it's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather
 Well actually I've heard on the news that we uh will be setting a record here in the State of Texas for the uh large amounts of rain and moisture we've had this year that it's going to break all kind of records that were set back since nineteen thirty-two
 So yeah 
 If it keeps on raining like this 
 and I understand it's supposed to rain until Saturday night
 Oh yes
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 And so are you an airline pilot
 Oh great
 For Southwest 
 fantastic 
 I have a brother that's a pilot also with American
 Yeah 
 So I imagine uh oh with all this kind of weather it uh makes it kind of dangerous for you 
 Oh I guess so 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh yes 
 Well we moved actually down here from another location 
 and it's spectacular the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain
 Pardon me
 I've never seen a thunder show like I've seen down here before in Texas
 Lights up the whole sky and even on a 
 actually I've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky 
 it's a cloudless night 
 and the rain isn't falling 
 but you can excuse me see the lightening going horizontally across the sky and back and forth and what a light show
 it's fabulous
 Yeah 
 that's true
 I'm from uh northern Utah 
 and that's a very arid climate from uh Salt Lake City area
 and there's always a lot of snow 
 In fact where I grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to uh twelve different major ski resorts 
 and so there was an awful lot of snow 
 and because it was an arid climate the snow was always a crisp powder light snow which made it fantastic for skiing and sleigh riding and everything else
 So we had a great time
 Um yeah 
 uh in Snowbird and Solitude and Brighton and yes all those areas 
 So I imagine have you skied before
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 Yeah 
 great 
 Well do you think the weather is typical for this time of the year
 Yes
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's been cold 
 There was a time though in the uh middle part of November that got really cool really really unseasonably cool
 and then it warmed right back up 
 and I thought great 
 and that's a fun th- 
 yeah 
 my wife was just listening here 
 and she said yeah 
 it froze in fact
 uh but uh I've really enjoyed the weather down here too 
 because uh two years ago we were the day after Christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weather 
 and it's not as severe I should say as the weather that I've experienced up in northern Utah
 Down here
 Not in Minnesota 
 I have a brother-in-law that lives in Minnesota 
 and they say boy six months out of the year it's bitter cold and the wind and the blowing snow and everything
 Uh-huh
