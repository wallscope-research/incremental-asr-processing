 So you have a son
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I would think so 
 When you 
 when your son was at home did you uh working 
 Did you work 
 or were you able to stay at home with him
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well when my mom uh 
 when I was growing up my mom worked too 
 but she worked nights and uh as a nurse
