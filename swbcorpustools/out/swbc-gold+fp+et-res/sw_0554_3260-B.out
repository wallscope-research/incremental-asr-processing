 Uh yes 
 Uh we have two sons 
 Uh one's a freshman in college 
 and one's a sophomore in high school
 And you
 Okay
 Oh 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 Uh *[[slash error]] Yeah
 Uh well uh yeah 
 We did spend a lot of time uh 
 it really helped when the uh older one was old enough to get his license and could uh drive around by himself although that brought in a whole other set of problems
 But uh I uh fo- 
 yeah 
 for one thing 
 Uh but yeah 
 uh we do 
 but our two had uh totally different interests of 
 but there was not much uh overlap as such 
 the older one was not at all into uh sports for the most part 
 Uh he participated 
 band and uh scouts were his two big things
 uh and the yeah younger one is uh uh the sports one 
 and whatever season it is he's playing although football is really his favorite 
 Yeah 
 So uh yeah 
 we spend a lot of time uh uh carpooling uh you know and then trying to be uh up as much as possible with anything that they do
 But then uh we also didn't spend uh time with them trying to 
 uh you know just family time
 Uh we had a 
 at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth 
 uh uh but we didn't uh do it as much or as often as uh I would have liked to 
 I would like to do that as a family and some T V watching 
 What about you
 Yeah 
 I've heard of that
 I've never actually played it 
 But 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 so do we
 Okay
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh now that's neat
 Yeah 
 No 
 we've never had anything like that
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh well good 
 Well you know in terms of any sorts of trends I you know 
 obviously things are different for me and my children than when I was growing up
 I grew up on a farm uh in Iowa 
 and uh you know the whole family was around the whole time 
 And then what my father did was uh you know obvious to me 
 and I helped out with it 
 But uh although I have brought my boys to see where I work it's not that easy 
 and it's certainly not at all common 
 and they just don't really have that same idea
 so they uh 
 it's a whole different uh kind of thing there then uh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well that makes it hard though in terms of you know family time with him
 Yeah 
 I've been lucky in that respect that I uh don't travel too much 
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yes
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 right
