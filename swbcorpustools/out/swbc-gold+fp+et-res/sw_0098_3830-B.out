 Hello
 Fine
 Okay 
 Let me ask you something can I run a minute and shut my radio off
 Okay
 Okay
 Arlington
 Arlington Texas
 Yes
 Yes 
 not all good stuff
 No
 No 
 I'm not personally
 I'm going to school right now
 I can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what I think
 I've got a lot of 
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Right
 Yes
 Yes 
 I've been in my own business Mary Kay in fact 
 I'm selling in out now to go to school full time 
 and I enjoyed the freedom of having that you know 
 go to work when I wanted to or not
 but you know the benefits weren't there
 So 
 Oh do you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 I think today the thing that I uh would appreciate the most 
 uh because my husband gets his medical through his company 
 but we have to pay for mine 
 and I'm the only one that's being insured 
 and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has I mean 
 so it's kind of 
 And I would 
 I really 
 and the way medical expenses are I think that's probably one of the biggest benefits you need to have 
 Right
 It's out of sight
 Right 
 it's out of sight
 Even at a group rate I couldn't believe how much is our 
 Right 
 it goes up 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Right 
 it's going to hurt the city 
 although uh I will personally tell you I used to work at a bank 
 and I would see the G M people come in when they would shut down to retool
 They were paid that whole time 
 and I don't know if you're aware of this r- 
 Yes 
 they come in there 
 just they go off fishing and stuff and come in every Friday and go to the safety deposit box 
 and I'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know 
 And they had all these gr- 
 I really believe they have done this to themselves in a way because of the unions being so stocked 
 And right now anybody's that's laid off from G M will have a full year's paycheck 
 I just read this in the paper the other day
 Plus probably an additional six months through the worker's stuff that they have uh through the company 
 so you know I'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt 
 but I don't feel as sorry for them
 If my husband were laid off tomorrow we'd get one more check 
 and that would be it
 Yes
 Oh yeah 
 that's already hurting
 But I think there's a case where benefits have gotten 
 they voted them in 
 and they got so good I mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know
 and it made the prices of cars go up 
 and you know the 
 I believe in unions 
 but they went too far
 I mean I can't make eighteen dollars an hour
 mean I know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour
