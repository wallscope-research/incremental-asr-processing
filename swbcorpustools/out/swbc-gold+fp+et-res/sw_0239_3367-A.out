 What 
 Do you want to start
 Right 
 You are right 
 Yeah 
 I suppose I should have
 Uh-huh 
 Uh yeah 
 uh uh I guess I hate to see anyone die uh
 but uh I guess these people that go around and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse uh I don't think they deserve to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well and even that I don't really know if that would help 
 I think a lot of these people do it uh mainly because of of T V 
 and a- 
 the double reason they see it being done on T V and also the fact of notoriety 
 I mean they become well known 
 They are almost like a big star
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 Well I think if they went according to uh the BIBLE where it does say an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life 
 uh you take a life you give yours
 Uh uh that's for sure 
 Uh there's exceptions to the rule 
 I mean if it's an accidental taking then uh you look at that 
 but you know most of these people that down right go right and do it out of pure pleasure uh I don't uh like to see that 
 I guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent 
 it is a deterrent in the sense that that person will never do it again 
 not if he's killed he can't do it again
 The death penalty
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 Well I guess I'm also looking at beyond even that 
 I guess I been thinking about it 
 and I don't have a definite opinion 
 but uh repeat uh crimes uh maybe not the more mild ones but you know more severe ones especially on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people and not just taking the money but beating them half to death
 Just for pleasure too 
 and I guess you've got to look at something like that 
 Do they deserve to uh remain on this earth too
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
