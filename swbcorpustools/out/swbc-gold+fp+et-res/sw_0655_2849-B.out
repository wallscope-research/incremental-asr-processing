 Uh you know we even lived there for a while when my husband was in the Navy
 In fact the first year we were married he had been there two years when we got married 
 and so we had a one year honeymoon
 Uh Uh it was very nice um
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I'm sure 
 Roberto died while we were there as a matter of fact
 Yeah
 It's like anywhere else 
 People are individuals 
 and I find it really difficult and frustrated trying to make stereotypes you know
 And uh I can understand the frustration you must have gone through uh going to the school uh
 No 
 no 
 it's just 
 if it's not part of your culture and you come upon something that you're totally unprepared for uh the firs- 
 I had gone to a very uh uh <> um conservative uh college 
 and when I started teaching school it was in an inner city situation although it was not Puerto Rican it was uh a Mexican American and black students
 They weren't like any of the Mexican American or black people I had gone to school with 
 so it was very very different 
 Yeah 
 Oh really
 Huh 
 Oh my 
 Yeah 
 I'm not so much against their making uh it a state
 But I would want a very clear majority 
 because if the minority can be so vociferous whether you're talking this group or any other group that has a stake in something
 And well a few can make it miserable for everybody else
 that my give you a clue
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 right *[[needs slash unit]] Oh I'm sure
 Same as any other part of the world 
 really
 I don't think it's really to their best interests to uh uh attain statehood as it is right now 
 they have the best of both worlds 
 They have uh representation
 but they don't have to pay all the taxes and so forth that we do
 Uh being that it's an island economy um 
 everything is imported 
 and yes the cost of living is super high 
 but they're protected in so many ways without having to pay for the rights and privileges
 So so you know I would just as soon 
 and if they voted for independence I would back them a hundred percent 
 And that's I guess because I'm not into territorialism or whatever that we have been in the past
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Oh yes 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Part of that though has been I think uh selected by them in that whereas they want the benefits of what the continentals can offer 
 they want to maintain that um culture of theirs which I understand
 and so often when you bring in the advantages the resources and so forth there is a trade
 Most of the people that I know about who really uh would favor statehood have pretty much assimilated into the continental states already
 Or they have family here and this way they can go back and forth 
 and it's not that much of a strain 
 and you know they're kind of lackadaisical about it At least at the present time 
 That's the way the pendulum seems to be swinging right now
 No 
 we really didn't keep that up 
 it's just 
 Um
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Um 
 And so th- 
 Yeah
 There really were three major um camps
 and there were those who uh were very friendly very open any anything we can do for you uh uh 
 either way you know was great 
 And then there were those at the other end of the spectrum and those that ho hum whatever you know 
 and uh it was interesting 
 the whole time we were there it was very very political 
 There was always some on Sunday afternoons uh going through the little neighborhoods with uh blow horns oh 
 I can't think of the term 
 but you know 
 And with banners and a parade of vehicles with their colors of a particular party 
 So they were very very um passionate about their beliefs 
 but it kind of broke down that you couldn't really see 
 I couldn't see that there was a clear majority that stayed 
 It seemed to shift as 
 Oh oh I see 
 okay 
 Well I have enjoyed it
 Uh-huh
 Bye-bye
