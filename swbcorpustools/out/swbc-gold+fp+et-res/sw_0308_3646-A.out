 Okay 
 uh so what do you think about the school system
 Uh why did you choose a private school
 Public school
 Oh has he
 Then how does he like it
 So he's been there all the time
 How big of a school is it
 A hundred per grade that's a good size
 Kind of gives them the you know 
 I get a little leery of the real small ones that they don't get much interaction with kids 
 but uh 
 So they don't 
 That's good 
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Right
 Still enjoy the 
 Right 
 Uh one thing I think I've noticed is uh my oldest is in kindergarten 
 so I'm in a little different ballgame 
 I'm just starting her 
 but uh seems to me that uh kids these days uh can really get away with murder 
 and the teachers aren't respected as much 
 and uh they have to be so careful of the things they do and say
 And uh makes me a little nervous that uh students don't seem to show that respect 
 and 
 No
 Heavens 
 no
 No 
 you wouldn't
 And uh the things they can say and do to a teacher they do from what I understand uh 
 I think that's wrong 
 I think we need to get back to show some respect 
 and course I guess the teacher used to warrant that 
 but 
 Right
 For other people 
 and 
 Well how do you think that that's happened 
 You think our society's just uh stopped talking out 
 or this uh generation's just kind of changed a little bit uh
 Right
 Right
 That just isn't coming through is it
 No 
 I mean I remember uh well it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi's 
 We used to have to wear dresses
 and then you had to go to dresses 
 they had to be a pantsuit 
 and it was polyester 
 and it had to be matching 
 and 
 Yes
 Exactly
 Yes
 Yes 
 so it's really changed 
 It's uh really kind of gone the rounds 
 so I think that maybe that's effected it to some degree 
 They say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit 
 so I 
 uh does this school your son goes to do they uh require to wear a uniform 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 there are quite a few of your s-
