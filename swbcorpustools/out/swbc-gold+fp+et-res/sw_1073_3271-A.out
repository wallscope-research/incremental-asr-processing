 Okay 
 What kind of pet do you have Gail
 Oh you have children 
 Have you
 Uh what have you had
 Oh
 Well you're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up
 Well we had a Schnauzer that we lost this summer 
 and he was fourteen years old 
 And uh we've had two Schnauzers 
 and before that we had all Dachshunds 
 and I think my husband wants another Dachshund 
 and we're trying to debate because our children are grown 
 and uh I don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a you know another dog 
 And we do have a very loving cat that's you know kind of our baby
 uh and we like pets 
 We like them around 
 We have grandchildren that run through 
 and they think we should have a dog 
 and that's because they have a Great Dane 
 They're just huge 
 Oh yes 
 yes
 Yes 
 I have never wanted to 
 that's why we've never gotten a female you know in anything
 uh uh and our male cats you know we had uh neutered right away 
 and of course he doesn't know it 
 He's still out partying
 But um you know I do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just have her spayed you know 
 And uh 
 Yes
 Yes 
 yes
 Which I think is a good thing 
 It just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved 
 and you know 
 It uh 
 plus uh you know the safety factor and stuff 
 Well we enjoy having pets 
 uh you know I think they're a lot of company 
 and when my mother lived with us uh the cat was really hers 
 and he was kind of wild 
 our daughter found her and brought her to us 
 and uh that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap
 And she was the only one at first that you know could really hold him you know because he was really skittish 
 But it was like he knew you know 
 and he would sleep with her 
 and so he was a lot of company to her You know and just love her 
 And cats are usually so independent 
 but this one you know he comes up 
 and he crawls up next to my husband now you know 
 He's 
 you know before the dog died we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side
 and the cat would sleep on my husband's side you know 
 And when everybody turned we all four of us turned in a row 
 Uh-huh
 Did he 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 <> uh-huh 
 I think that's one of the reasons our 
 because as I said our Schnauzer was old
 And so he was becoming incontinent 
 And so then I would just have messes in the house 
 and I think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with you know
 uh and it was new carpeting 
 and you know it just really you know upset me no end
 And uh 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 you will 
 You will 
 You know we were trying to decide you know about putting him to sleep 
 you know he was getting so old and had other problems too 
 and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier You know 
 and again going through that because our animals are almost like our kids in some ways you know 
 and you grieve just as much over them when they go you know as you would a child 
 and you know our son and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say get a dog get a dog you know
 Little thing 
 Be quiet 
 be quiet 
 And I can tell my husband you know deep down you know he real-
