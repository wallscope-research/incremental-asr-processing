 Uh let's see 
 How uh let's see about ten years ago 
 uh what do you think was different ten years ago from now
 Uh-huh <>
 Uh-huh
 We 
 Well uh actually ten years from today seems rather short
 Uh but I do agree that uh generally society has sort of uh let's see rushed everything ahead
 And uh I don't know 
 it leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that 
 In other words they just prioritize their lives differently 
 But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation
 Uh 
 Um It depends 
 Uh it's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too
 Uh I just 
 I'm twenty-eight
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I think that things have been busy all along 
 It's just a matter where priorities are placed And that uh usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home
 And now uh it's pretty much an economic necessity in most places for both parents to work
 I think that's part of it too 
 But I do think 
 No 
 no 
 I don't 
 No 
 I don't think that 
 But then there are a lot of people that don't have that But that really do need to work
 I think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents just to survive 
 And then there is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that uh they think is surviving which is really more luxuries
 Uh but I tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive
 I'm saying that uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working is more of the majority than the people that have the higher standard of living 
 Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing uh middle class in this country I think that that's in my opinion the case
 So 
 I mean I have met people that just want to maintain the standard of living and those that really need the job
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
