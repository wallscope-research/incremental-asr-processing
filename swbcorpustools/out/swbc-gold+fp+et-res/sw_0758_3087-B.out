 Okay 
 now we're supposed to talk about music
 why did you check music
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 What kind of music do you enjoy
 Like what kind of oldies
 Like the fifties oldies or older oldies
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 They have the same kind of station down here 
 and when I listen to music most of the time that's what I listen to
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 we just got a disk the other day that was a um disk of Nat King Cole's greatest hits
 and it is excellent 
 it's about twenty of his greatest hits on it 
 It's really an excellent excellent C D 
 we were really quite pleased with it 
 It was good
 um do you listen 
 have you heard of Nat King Cole
 Okay 
 Well um um <> do you play any musical instruments or anything
 Really *[[ slash error ]] at the same time or 
 *[[slash error should be qy]] Uh-huh 
 Like so you're in the marching band and stuff in high school
 Yeah 
 I played the baritone horn in high school band and in college 
 So and my wife played flute in high school
 So 
 Really
 really
 Actually that's exactly the same thing my ex-wife did 
 She played the clarinet 
 and then she played bass clarinet during concert band
 Yes 
 yeah 
 so 
 Um Well I like it 
 I like the low instruments better too
 Um do you go to listen to much live music
 Do you listen to much live music like concerts or things there
 Uh-huh 
 we're going to one here in a couple of weeks 
 The 
 um um I don't know if you follow Broadway much 
 but uh Michael Crawford was in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA on Broadway
 You know you know whom I'm talking about
 And he's coming to Dallas on the twenty-ninth 
 and we got a big group going down to hear him sing a bunch of uh Andrew Lloyd Webber's <> music 
 So that'll be good
 My sons are kind of into Broadway 
 my older son is at Columbia in New York City 
 and he's been to see PHANTOM and LES MISERABLES and bunch of other things up there 
 so 
 And he does it 
 he can go if they get sixteen dollar tickets to that thing 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 and one of the uh 
 the last time they went up a friend of his wanted to go 
 and Chris didn't want to go 
 so the friend David went 
 and he went and bought one of the low priced student tickets 
 and they gave him the seat that normally belongs to John Bel John <> 
 It's his house seat 
 That's under his control 
 and he said it was a great seat
 So they've been to see it several times
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Would they 
 don't any of those ever come to Pittsburgh
 Sure 
 Well we're kind of you know 
 they 
 well I saw two road shows of LES MIS- 
 and they were both excellent
 So if it comes to Pittsburgh in the road shows and I think they have three different companies that tour the U S um you should go see it because it's really outstanding
 Right
 Well I think it's just incredible 
 I 
 and then you know those um two guys who wrote LES MIS wrote a new show call MISS SAIGON <>
 Yeah 
 it just opened in New York this spring 
 and my son and his friend were in a lottery to get tickets to it 
 and they got tickets for the opening night
 And they went to it 
 and they said it was great 
 Yeah 
 like Depressed Mode 
 and 
 Yeah 
 I don't too much 
 but my younger son listens to some of that kind of stuff
 So he listens to New Wave 
 and you listen to the oldies
 That's kind of different 
 Well that's good though you know 
 It's good to cover all the bases there
 Uh-huh
 Well now we don't listen to much country 
 but we just 
 at the same night we bought that Nat King Cole album we bought Garth Brooks' album No Fences
 That is excellent 
 I've never listened 
 I mean I've probably heard him 
 but I've never bought any of his music
 Garth Brooks is probably the only country album we have 
 or no wait my wife bought an album of Hank Williams' greatest hits
 Nope 
 this is Hank Williams senior 
 so these are a bunch of old recordings
 She bought that the same night we bought the Nat King Cole and the Garth Brooks
 It is pretty good 
 She likes it
 it's a little too country for me 
 it's a little too uh ronky tonk or something
 I like the Garth Brooks album a lot
 It's pretty good 
 it's pretty good
 Uh-huh
 which of his albums do you think is the best
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I think we'll probably get one of his albums because we do kind of like it 
 but you know it's kind of different
 So so it's good
 Yeah 
 we do like the 
 in fact we have a album
