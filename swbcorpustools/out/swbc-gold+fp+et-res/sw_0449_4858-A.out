 Uh I'm of the age that could have gone although I didn't 
 and uh I guess uh looking back on it I tend to think it was uh mostly a mistake
 On the other hand uh the more I learn about the history the more I see it was incremental uh decisions Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time
 uh but on the whole I think it uh probably was the wrong thing to do 
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 *[[slash error]] Yeah
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] Yeah 
 it's funny 
 Tonight I was uh helping my kid with an essay on uh Stalin
 And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how uh in World War Two the personalties of Stalin Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war 
 and actually when you think back on the big events of the war uh it was almost a personal struggle among these three uh 
 I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense
 Uh they're certainly all leaders 
 uh and uh with their nations pretty solidly behind each one of them
 And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the uh early decisions of the Vietnam war That the uh people saw the cold war as uh you had to draw a line and defend it 
 Otherwise they'd get you someplace else
 Looking back it seems like that was only partly true That uh there might have been a better place to draw the line 
 Uh I guess you can say that a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight uh brought the cold war to an end 
 But I don't think you can just fight anywhere just in order to uh call the bully out and beat him 
 And I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war 
 They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward 
 And uh we were wrong 
 But I uh you know 
 like I said the more I hear about it the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable 
 But the accumulative effect was to really get into a hopeless situation where 
 and as you say uh going halfway was probably worse than uh uh committing to a completely and uh winning it whatever that would mean
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Well you're not 
 It's ambivalent 
 yeah
 what about the domestic effects 
 like I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it uh possible and even popular to uh criticize the government 
 And they 
 that pendulum started to swing uh maybe even too far To the point where uh uh supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on
 And that tradition is still 
 I mean it's dying now 
 but it's still alive as opposed to 
 this Desert Storm stuff may have uh killed it 
 But I think that was one of the biggest 
 that you know the domestic unrest
