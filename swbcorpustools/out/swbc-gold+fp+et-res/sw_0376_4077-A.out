 How do you feel about gun control
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well don't you think that you know just having you know some you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry 
 I mean It varies from State to State
 There is no national 
 Uh in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon You know or on probation or uh you know other obvious things like that 
 Uh and I know that like in a lot of states you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before You know be obviously insane 
 you know but have your legal right to get a gun
 Uh yeah 
 I'd probably say about a five
 Seems like it's a good safe number to pick you know
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Well you know uh uh no- 
 if you are looking at like you know country uh where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that you know 
 the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much
 Well I mean yeah 
 uh the 
 in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States
 Uh you know I mean the problem though you know since the United States had this you know pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think you know if you were introduced you know any controls it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already 
 You know so it's really kind of a complex problem
 Uh I'm not really sure how bad it is 
 I've not really had that many problems with it 
 but I mean apparently we were ranked pretty high up
 Uh I mean I think you know in the te- 
 I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I've thought about getting one 
 If I get one I think I will probably you know get something 
 I probably wouldn't get a hand gun 
 I would probably get like a shotgun 
 Just for protecting myself You know from burglar type thing 
 I do kind of live in the downtown area
 You know and shotguns are really good because they're 
 I mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know
 Uh and you know you 
 yeah 
 I just don't understand these people you know like when they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves 
 They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know 
 they are probably going to miss the person 
 and they're going to shoot through five wall and hit someone you know 
 I mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon 
 You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever
 You pretty much stop them 
 And you don't 
 then the actual shot doesn't go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that really does scare me People you know that have guns 
 because you know if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot 
 but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that person rushes you
 And you know you're pretty much dead you know Because you've just told the person that you're about to kill them then You know 
 and well I mean you basically made it clear to the person you know unless you know that you are a real danger to them 
 and then you know if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to you know stop you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Yeah 
 did it happen at a cafeteria or something
 Uh-huh
