 What vacations have you been on that you like
 Right
 Uh-huh
 So you 
 most of yours is kind of driving 
 and 
 Um how far do you usually end up driving 
 Now you're from where *[[slash error]] Oh Wisconsin
 Okay 
 Yeah 
 I have a brother in Minnesota that used to live in Wisconsin
 So yeah 
 that's quite a ways
 I've uh 
 we went to California this last year and uh liked it 
 but it was too crowded
 Walt Disney World and other places it's just the wrong time of the year to go
 And uh course uh you get in any of those tourist traps and everything's uh outrageously priced 
 and uh kind of 
 you wonder if it's really worth it to pay uh thirty-five dollars or forty dollars just to get in
 But There's lots of fun places to see Um 
 I think the scenery kind of 
 that's something do to like to get up in mountains 
 *[[two utts]] or 
 Do you have any mountains nearby
 Pretty flat isn't it
 Um I think uh the biggest limitation is a lot just time and money isn't it
 What vacation have you enjoyed the most
 What is it
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Probably a city in itself kind of like huh
 Summer place 
 How far away is it
 Huh
 Okay 
 sure
 Sure
 Right 
 well and you can probably 
 you're in a climate that's kind of humid 
 so you have probably a lot of green and lot of real pretty things 
 our climate's real dry 
 and you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery 
 most of the land's pretty brown 
 You don't have as much of the greenery like you have
 Uh Idaho is where I live 
 and uh 
 Yes
 It's by uh 
 I have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that I'm on the phone
 It's by um Boise 
 You ever heard of Boise
 And uh it's fine 
 it's nice 
 It's uh lot different kind of 
 I lived in Indiana for a while 
 and it's a real different uh land and scenery than there 
 It's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity and things like that 
 I think uh there's a lot of places uh oh down even in southern Utah the canyon lands and Bryce Canyon 
 and oh boy they're gorgeous 
 Those are kind of fun places 
 We usually go over to Bear Lake in the summer which is kind of on the border of Idaho and Utah 
 and the lake goes on forever 
 and that's real pretty over there too
 But I think I'm kind of a summer vacationer
 Right
 Right
 Where'd you
