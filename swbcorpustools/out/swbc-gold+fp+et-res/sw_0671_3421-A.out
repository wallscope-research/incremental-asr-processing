 So so what have you seen lately that um you think is worthwhile
 No 
 I saw the previews
 does it have a happy ending 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Oh that was funny wasn't it 
 Yes 
 and the regular NAKED GUN and AIRPORT and you know
 Yes
 Right 
 So now these are for two very different movies 
 one uh absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly you know serious subject
 Yeah 
 I guess I have similarly broad tastes 
 Um my most recent um movie that I liked a lot not my most recent movie was HENRY THE FIFTH 
 I only rented it you know maybe a month ago
 and it's been out for a couple of years 
 but Have you seen that
 Well it's an adaptation of the Shakespeare play 
 and it's beautifully done 
 Um I believe that all the language is as Shakespeare wrote it except it's been shortened a little bit 
 and there might be a word or two changed
 Uh but it's a glorious movie
 um and I like as you know these silly movies 
 and I also like just some strange movies 
 Do you have any
 Well the one that comes immediately to mind um is the THE COOK THE THIEF HIS WIFE HER LOVER 
 Um but there are also these various um David Lynch movies
 Um I got hooked on TWIN PEAKS 
 That made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie I could lay my hands on
 Oh 
 Um well I don't especially recommend 
 I mean you have to just sort of like this thing 
 you have to like 
 did you see TWIN PEAKS
 No 
 so okay 
 So if you weren't drawn to watch that maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies either
 they're just strange
 Well uh I think suspense is the right word 
 Uh but a little bit strange and esoteric 
 and uh in the case of TWIN PEAK there's some elements of the supernatural in it too
 That was the television show
 Um there's also a producer of movies in Baltimore called um John Walters who puts on even weirder movies 
 Uh his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream like HAIR SPRAY 
 Um but back in his early days he had things um um 
 what are the titles 
 I can't remember the titles any more But some really weird ones uh with quite a random crew of characters 
 Um it would have made you know these Fellini movies look normal
 I do like movies a lot
 do you rent them 
 or 
 Yes
 Yeah 
 that's what my wife does too um 
 I mean she falls asleep 
 So we have to pick just the right kind of movie to appeal
 Well well it was good talking to you
 Take care
 Okay 
 bye
