 Oh yes 
 yeah 
 They just uh started it again too just late or within the past few years 
 You know for quite some time just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty
 Uh yes 
 Well they find it is more deterrent
 Well uh if you You know compare the figures I think that's where uh they're coming from 
 The uh 
 Oh yes They are 
 That was before uh uh they adopted the death law again 
 But uh I myself am in favor of it uh particularly for uh well I think Texas has a good law Uh crimes murders related with uh drugs or killing a policemen
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Well why stop at children 
 Why not go to adults too
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yep
 Well I don't either 
 uh uh but there is something to be said about <> 
 or uh uh just for the sake of argument I'm taking a con 
 I'm against it 
 Uh you know yourself how many times have you heard where uh uh a citizen was wrongfully arrested and served time at a penitentiary uh 
 just recently this uh black man served nine years was it for robbery 
 Uh-huh
 That's it
 Uh-huh 
 Well right now our laws are so liberal that uh even with the death penalty in effect I don't think that uh they're going to use it uh too frequently uh unfortunately 
 I like you say yes 
 let's have it give them all a shot get rid of them 
 Why should they be sitting in uh prison getting their college degree
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 very true 
 uh I agree with you there 
 Uh *[[slash error]] Uh-huh 
 Well I myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that 
 Uh uh that's an awful lot uh to expect of a person uh to kill somebody is what it amounts to
 It 
 true 
 Very true 
 But they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason
 Yeah 
 well uh *[[slash error]] Uh-huh <> 
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 Well anyhow I guess we both agree that it should be in effect
 Oh that's true 
 Well now uh just believe in just about any state in the union uh uh a uh or uh yeah death verdict is an automatic uh appeal
 And uh uh yes 
 I'm inclined to agree with you 
 I think so 
 there should be a limit as to the number of appeals
 Um um well Not just for dealing in drugs 
 It uh 
 There are certain circumstances 
 and I don't remember what they are
 Uh yes
 Uh-huh 
 Oh oh yes 
 yes 
 I believe it's any capital crime related to drugs
 I think that's the way it's worded
 I do believe that's in 
 Uh I wouldn't swear to it myself
 But I thought it was in effect
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh it does 
 Uh I have four sons myself 
 and the youngest is twenty-eight
 so they are all pretty well grown up 
 and they all went through it you know going through high school and everything 
 and knock wood that uh they have not 
 well I won't say they didn't try it uh 
 I wouldn't know 
 but uh they 
 I doubt very much that they're using it now 
 In fact I'm sure they don't
 Huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 That's usually the way it is 
 it's just uh try it out with their peers 
 And none of them even smoke 
 They don't uh 
 they never 
 strangely enough uh their mother and I both smoked when they were growing up 
 Now my ex-wife she quit uh well when she was pregnant with the last one 
 and she never started up again 
 And I just quit oh about fourteen months and two weeks ago
 Yes 
 it is 
 I 
 and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by
 Um 
 Well when I was still smoking I felt that way 
 If I was in a public restaurant seated at table with uh non smokers I would try to pick my seat where the smoke would blow away from them 
 Or I'd hold the cigarette under the table
 uh but uh now the shoe's on the other foot 
 Uh I'm aware of other people smoking now
 Um
 Yes 
 Uh-huh
 Uh uh-huh
 Well there's a trick I use 
 They used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment
 And every time I wanted one I have to go outside and just take one One at a time 
 And uh that gets to be uh a deterrent
