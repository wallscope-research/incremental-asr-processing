 Well I have to say my favorite type of music would probably be uh classical music
 Oh really
 What type of music do you like in the classical area 
 or what era do you like the most
 Uh-huh
 Um do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I haven't gotten into that too much because uh if I don't know the story line and um I don't speak the language then I have difficult time comprehending what's going on
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 What is that
 Oh I didn't know that
 That can help people like me
 Well I can understand that 
 So I'd say Vivaldi is probably my favorite uh composer
 Yeah 
 I like Baroque music
 I like full body music uh um um with brass and winds woodwinds instruments you know 
 Course I like uh also string instruments 
 and I have two string instruments in my house Uh instrument players 
 both my sons play string instruments 
 One plays the cello 
 and the other one plays the viola
 So I get to go to at least four or five concerts a year 
 One is thirteen and one is eleven
 Yes
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 We're on our way
 So uh um I try to enjoy all of it
 Um a little bit 
 but um a lot of the um music I don't know about uh as far as the titles
 and I have to listen to it and figure out what I'm listening to 
 Um I do belong to a Musical Heritage Society
 Do you belong to that
 You can get recordings 
 Uh they know have them on compact disc uh or cassettes or L Ps 
 and uh they do a lot of original recordings themselves
 But uh they also uh go to the different composers or the different I guess 
 what do you call them the guys that orchestrate the conductors 
 Yeah 
 They go to conductors uh 
 and they actually have them perform the music 
 and they record it
 Sure 
 A lot of them are
 Or they will find out when they're performing 
 and they will uh record the music at that time 
 And so uh it is uh uh high quality grade music 
 and of course now they also have a jazz section 
 and they also have a uh more contemporary and American uh composer section
 Yeah
 Well you can control it
 Oh really
 I see
 Well that's good
 Yes 
 I play guitar and early years played saxophone
