 All right 
 I think our experience of camping is 
 I am the passive member 
 I get things ready and then I enjoy
 Uh because my husband is a good camper 
 and so they 
 he manages the troops 
 and they do the work 
 and I have fun 
 That's when we camped the most
 When 
 I thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because uh it seems like I would go through a period of time where I just uh was really overworked you know 
 and getting out into nature and relaxing and having the family do a good share of the work you know 
 and the part that I did was more fun uh than labor because they did the running and toting chores and I just helped cook and kind of organize you know
 It is 
 isn't it 
 It isn't 
 Ha- what kinds of things have you tried 
 Have you done uh uh uh the big pot cooking
 Oh yeah
 Big frying p- 
 Oh that's interesting 
 You know interesting enough uh the food part was kind of uh important thing in our camping 
 Uh when my oldest son uh 
 always at the beginning I did all the shopping and everything 
 But the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his uh uh cooking merit badge in 
 and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff 
 and uh I mean you know he did it up really good 
 And so uh after he took that merit badge he did all the shopping and getting ready for it
 it was a marvelous experience because after that then all I had to do was uh follow the instructions you know and do 
 And we did a lot of interesting kinds of things 
 like I would take corn bread and uh cook a pan inside of a pan over a camp uh stove
 And it works real good 
 It's like an oven
 Just uh put a thing on it
 What did you like to do most
 That's neat isn't it
 Right 
 I agree
 Huh 
 Well now in Florida are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot
 Uh-huh
 Oh is that true 
 Now now we're in Texas now 
 and you're in Texas 
 right
 Okay uh 
 we have not camped a great deal here because uh a good share of the time in the Summer time it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping
 I gue- 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 we have done that 
 but we camped mostly 
 when the kids were little we were in New Jersey and Uh in uh Allendale uh and uh Waldwick 
 it's just about twelve miles south of the New York border
 And we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp 
 and it was so you know pick your own uh blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast 
 Uh also 
 go ahead 
 Oh are you 
 Where did you live
 Oh oh yeah 
 I know that 
 I had a cousin who lived in White Plains 
 that's a neat area 
 But that is a particularly neat area for camping because 
 Yeah 
 it is neat though because there are lots of lakes fairly near by 
 you don't have to go very far
 uh and there's uh a lot of trees lot of mountains and lot of uh hiking sort of things 
 and we had uh little clipper sail boat 
 And so we would sail and uh did a lot of camping that way
 Oh do you 
 We've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis 
 and it's fun too I think
 Do you
 That's neat 
 so you kind of uh uh an everyday camper 
 A full time camper
 Well now are you living alone now 
 or 
 You and your dog huh 
 Hey 
 that sounds great 
 Well we don't camp quite as much as we used to 
 but uh I still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family and enjoy nature and uh kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life 
 I'd always 
 right 
 I'd always come home just relaxed and uh comfortable and ready to go at it again 
 so it was a neat activity 
 Good to talk to you 
 Tell me your name again
 Jack
 all right
 yes 
 we've been here 
 we're in Plano
 but we've been here about uh eighteen years

 Well we're all lots of people from T I up this way
 All right

 bye-bye
