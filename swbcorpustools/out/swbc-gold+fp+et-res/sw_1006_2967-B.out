 Uh well I have uh seen DANCES WITH WOLVES which is probably the best movie that I have seen lately 
 Uh I do not go out to films very often So as far as out of the house 
 So we do get a lot of videos that we bring in
 uh and I see some that way 
 But uh I am not real current on films 
 How about you
 I hear that is really good but I have not seen it yet
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Oh cute
 Oh dear
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Oh and he hears them or something 
 and 
 Who wins
 Oh great 
 great 
 Yeah 
 I had heard people talk about it 
 and they say it was really cute but I had not seen it
 Uh we usually wait 
 and eventually it comes out on video 
 and then we get it and see it that way
 And that is it 
 movies are very expensive 
 Uh movie theatres here they are six dollars uh for evening performances 
 And that is kind of steep
 I think 
 I don't know 
 How much is it in Dallas
 Yeah 
 You can do that but it is difficult if you if you work or you know 
 uh that is taking the middle of the afternoon 
 And if I am looking for entertainment usually I have more uh time in the evening than I do in the middle of the day to uh see things 
 What do you think of movies in general 
 As far as the trends
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Did 
 Yeah 
 The quality I think maybe has improved in that respect
 Uh the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a tougher rating Which suggests that you know it will be more enticing to the to the public 
 And a lot of times it is added for no real uh valid reason
 Uh which does not make 
 and I think SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT was a little bit like that
 Uh but DANCES WITH WOLVES did not seem to have anything added 
 It was just all legitimate kind of uh film 
 And that is where reason why I suppose it won so many Oscars uh 
 because it really was good even though it is such a long movie 
 You know they said "Oh people won't be interested in a three hour movie" But it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone
 Oh oh yeah
 Absolutely 
 Uh but much more true to life 
 and I think that is the point
 Uh they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good
 I hate sequels too 
 I hate these uh you know number one two three four
 Usually if a movie is good once is enough 
 Right 
 That was on Prime Time Television here uh recently at seven thirty in the evening 
 And uh it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie And children young children could have seen that movie uh at that hour 
 And I thought you know that would not have been the sort of thing I would have wanted my children to see at that age uh I mean when they were young 
 And here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the T V
 Uh which was a 
 it was a good movie 
 I mean it was well done but uh that is one reason why it was scary
 So but I do not know that I have seen any of the uh sequels to that 
 I think one is enough 
 Uh <>
 Yes uh-huh 
 That is what people say
 Oh
 Yeah 
 It 
 just a touch
 Well the whole movie is kind of far fetched
 But I mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched
 not too often 
 That has gotten to be a whole camp idea now though you know 
 If you hear that music you know everybody knows what you are talking about
 It's funny 
 Well it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah 
 I saw it then too Yeah 
 It was good
 It was very good 
 But uh um uh see I have uh teenagers in my house 
 And of course sometimes they rent movies and you know have friends over or something 
 And sometimes movies are here that I am not even aware that I could have seen you know 
 Because my family tells me that it had been actually in the house before 
 But I had missed it 
 But I did see it on T V 
 and I thought it was good
 Oh really
 Uh-huh
 No kidding
 Oh I did not realize that
 Yeah 
 Uh you know the character that uh James Earle Jones played
 Uh uh I teach in school 
 and we are doing a book called INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison
 And I wondered if maybe he was patterned after him
 Uh I do not know 
 I had not heard anybody talk about it 
 But uh he certainly could have been Uh which was kind of interesting You know someone uh who was a real activist but then took up the cause Uh kind of gave up you know because he did not think anything was happening 
 so uh it was kind of fun
 I do not know for sure 
 but there are certain uh qualities that suggest it could be he 
 Because uh they were suggesting that this Ben was something of a recluse 
 That he had stopped writing and had stopped you know 
 and that is true for Ellison 
 he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it And uh has pretty much dropped out of public life 
 But he is still alive 
 and you know that is what makes it so interesting
 And that book have you ever read that book INVISIBLE MAN
 INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison
 It is an incredible book 
 It uh really is very interesting 
 I highly recommend it
 Uh the 
 yeah 
 the movie 
 the 
 in 
 FIELD OF DREAMS came out after uh that novel
 So it could easily have been patterned after him 
 But the movie did not have anything to do with the story that I am talking about 
 But 
 I just thought the uh author could have been patterned after that uh 
 I mean that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him certainly
 Sort of interesting 
 so Well I guess we have talked probably our time limit haven't we
 Okay
 Very good 
 It was nice talking to you
 Okay 
 Bye-bye
