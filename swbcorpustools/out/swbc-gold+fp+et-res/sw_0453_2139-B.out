 *[[slash error]] Well I think uh 
 *[[slash error should be '%']] I haven't had that much of course 
 I just heard 
 but I haven't had that much time to think about it either 
 I guess the uh biggest thing I find is the financial aspects uh particularly the ability of people to access you know your financial records or for example your credit uh rating almost at will
 And uh of course flying uh 
 using your Social Security number of course permits people to do that
 and almost anything you do now a Social Security number is required
 And uh of course there's another aspect of this too uh in terms of invasion of privacy 
 I just thought about it 
 being a professional of course you probably belong to one or more professional organizations 
 and that is that 
 some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which I think is an invasion of privacy
 *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] And not only that it opens you to <> phone solicitations
 and I've noticed more and more I would say over the last six months
 *[[slash error--one utt with b26]] I am getting more at home phone solicitations for a variety of things from 
 I've had them for carpet cleaning 
 I've had them of course for you know real estate investments
 you know you get uh please send in uh you know this particular card and you get uh a free trip or something along those lines
 And so uh that bothers me because of course I enjoy being at home and I do not enjoy getting called by strangers uh particularly you know soliciting 
 So having your 
 and I know that a lot of these of course are random phone calls
 they just you know start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers 
 but some of them are sold 
 and I know you 
 talking about mailing lists the 
 I 
 there is one particular group to which I belong 
 and for some 
 the reason they have three different names for me 
 Now the address is the same you know my office address 
 But they have one under you know my first name James 
 They have one under my first name and middle initial 
 then they have a third one under just my two initials
 and I get mail here at home under each of those names
 So I know that they have sold their mailing list
 And uh I think those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy 
 And uh I can't really think of anything else offhand that uh 
 Uh-huh
 I think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner
 I know when I sit down with the family and want to have the opportunity to talk and see what's going on and all those things 
 even if friends call it irritates me
 So I try to 
 I actually during that period of time you know usually from six o'clock or six thirty whenever I get home until eight or so I will shut off the phone 
 and uh my daughter gets irate when I do that because you know she's a teenager
 so she'll you know 
 why are you cutting off the phone *[[slash error]] I might get an important phone call 
 So I guess those three things are the uh uh most irritating to me
 That's right
 Well now we have a you know voice mail system uh at the office
 Now what I have done is I have forwarded my home phone to the answering service at the office so that I do not have to have uh a ring at all if I want to do that
 uh or I will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward uh to the office
 And so you know it makes it convenient 
 But at the office when I you know 
 uh on our system and I imagine on most systems you can just route it directly to the answering service
 And when I want to be you know not bothered during the day that's exactly what I do
 And so uh 
 Uh
 Yeah 
 well Tigon is part of G T E
 *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 *[[slash error]] Except we call it Aspen
 Yes
 And uh we 
 Yeah 
 G T E purchased Tigon 
 And so we had been using the Aspen service before they purchased Tigon 
 so I imagine we will be uh shifting over to that service uh or in a while As soon as we determine what we're going to do with Contel after we bought Contel 
 Yeah 
 Oh Dana I think we have probably conversed long enough
 Well 
 All right
 *[[slash error]] All right 
 *[[slash error should be 'aa']] well thank you for calling 
 I enjoyed talking to you
 Take care
