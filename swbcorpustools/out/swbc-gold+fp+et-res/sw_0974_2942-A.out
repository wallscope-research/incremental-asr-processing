 Okay 
 Um do you have any advice for college 
 I'm full of advice 
 I'm still a graduate student 
 So 
 Um
 Yeah
 Um
 Oh that's interesting 
 I went to a liberal arts school actually at first 
 and um they didn't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were in your second year 
 and then by the end of the second you had to pick some sort of major 
 but until then they didn't sort of force you 
 they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then Certain requirements 
 so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything 
 so it wasn't that specialized 
 So that 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 I was just on a committee recently actually sponsored by uh the American Association for the Advancement of Science you know where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together you know because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts 
 and then the other way around as well 
 people are getting pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Well that must be helpful
 That could be very helpful 
 Yeah 
 well I figure that that's probably the thing I would most tell any parent you know to tell their kids I think probably 
 make sure the kid goes to a school where they get sort of a general education 
 and save specialization I guess for graduate school unless they're sure early on they want to do something like engineering or something 
 Or they can 
 Um
 Yeah 
 but that's a good idea 
 Well where I am right now 
 actually I'm at the University of Rochester 
 and that's a pretty good engineering school I think 
 I think they have pretty good engineering here 
 They also have a fairly large liberal arts college as well A sort of a separate you know arts and sciences college 
 Um and I believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in everything 
 and uh I do work in language processing 
 [ and at least one person who's in my field started off as an electrical engineer student and then switched over at some point into language processing because he found that he enjoyed it more 
 So they do force them 
 people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here which I think is wonderful
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 <> Uh-huh
 Um
 Um uh-huh 
 That would be very good actually
 Right 
 you don't need any philosophy at all in school 
 Uh-huh 
 Or so- 
 yeah 
 or some other thought provoking area you know 
 Very true 
 uh when I went to undergraduate we had uh 
 went to Brandeis 
 don't know if you know of it or not uh 
 we had uh uh a requirement freshman year of just Humanities 
 Then you were given a choice of um you know 
 there were ten or twelve or whatever or fifteen different courses that you could take 
 but they all came out of Philosophy English and Literature departments 
 and they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read you know for 
 so the first year Humanities courses everyone had to read the Iliad and so forth 
 and what they did do was they all approached it from very different 
 so that you could have one class in the philosophy of something the philosophy of Greek mythology or something that actually approached this you know or a literature course or just all sorts of different perspectives on it 
 and people got to pick and choose 
 but by the end everyone had a good sample of sort of how to think about these things nonscientifically you know 
 uh and that sort of forced them 
 But I believe that one of the best things to do at least for me in school was I was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses 
 Um I was forced to take I think you know some sort of art history course 
 and we all grumbled about it at first 
 but then afterward we all wound up taking extra art history classes because it just seemed like something we didn't totally know nothing about but just enjoyed very much doing and something I would never would have done if I wasn't forced to take it
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 Uh-huh 
 and that really is something that I notice 
 like I talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized 
 and they don't have that 
 you know they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take 
 and that was all 
 They never had some of the more fun classes I guess 
 I feel a little more worldly now 
 Yes 
 I'm hoping I'm hoping
 Yes 
 I graduated um college in eighty-seven 
 and I just went straight through 
 Um I'm finishing up next year 
 So yeah 
 I didn't take any break or anything yet 
 in graduate school I've been trying to do the same thing take courses completely outside my area 
 and I'm finding in graduate school it's a lot harder because uh I just don't have the time any more to sort of sit in a course that I'm not getting graded for 
 Whereas before I would just sign up for credit for it now I can't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily 
 So I have to try and go myself 
 and I went for like two or three weeks and realized not enough time for the work unfortunately
 I'm pursuing a Doctorate in Psychology 
 So I'm just wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead 
 Uh what else 
 I think I 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Um You had real world experience in the middle there
 And that helped you think 
 Or that was 
 Uh-huh 
 Um Yeah 
 I'm getting some of that 
 Um I have sort of some work experience 
 My wife is not an academic at all 
 My wife is sort of in the real world 
 and so I sort of hinge halfway out in the real world 
 and getting you know real world 
 Especially she works for a temporary agency 
 and I never would have had 
 she's the office supervisor 
 I've learned much just sort of by watching her and her business as well 
 So yeah 
 so I can see where that might be a 
 Yeah 
 That's my 
 oh yeah
 Yeah 
 agreed 
 agreed 
 Well I'll take that and think that through a little bit Uh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
