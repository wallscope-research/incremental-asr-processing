 At 
 currently I think they are a little restrictive Uh particularly for uh certain ethnic groups or from certain countries 
 Um I think we should permit uh more immigration from eastern Europe for example uh particularly uh the Jewish uh uh people from Russia 
 I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last uh several years 
 And I think we have uh uh too much restriction uh on the Orientals also 
 but of course that's just my opinion 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well we seem uh to favor certain uh uh countries particularly South American countries 
 And uh there is no uh uh 
 I have nothing of course against uh uh the South Americans uh or Hispanics in that sense 
 but I think we uh are more restrictive of the uh so called eastern uh European countries than uh we should be 
 Of course that's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern Europe 
 so 
 uh so I think uh you know the uh embargo we placed uh on the Russian Jews although we uh spent years and years uh lobbying for their release and their ability to um immigrate from Russia as soon as that occurred we simply said that uh instead of the uh hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by uh two thirds 
 So 
 I do not quite go along with that 
 but 
 No 
 And I still think 
 you know again kind of having uh uh within this century come from uh an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides 
 Both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants 
 so I'm a little touchy every now and then about that 
 Uh-huh
 Oh my 
 Uh-huh
 Well I think in a way though uh uh I also have uh an opposite point of view which is uh although I believe we should uh permit uh you know constant immigration into this country uh uh primarily for economic reasons I think we should have um some quotas 
 of course my family and I 
 again that was you know 
 my grandparents came over during the time when uh there were quotas 
 So they had to wait uh you know in uh certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over
 So you know 
 but uh I think unrestricted immigration I think uh is not best uh
 Uh-huh 
 Well you know there's another aspect of this too 
 They're also uh uh diminishing the uh health restrictions which 
 Well yes 
 There were some uh regulations over 
 I don't know whether they're laws passed or whatever they're called uh just recently where uh people with certain diseases cannot be excluded uh from uh immigration 
 Age is one for example 
 and uh recently uh tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country uh they dropped that also 
 So I think in some ways we are uh becoming a little too egalitarian in that sense 
 but uh I think we should be a little more circumspect about it 
 Again my opinion 
 Think we've talked long enough
 All right
 I have talked long enough
 Thank you
 Good-bye
