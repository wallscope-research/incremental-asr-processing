 Well we haven't really heard that much in the news lately about uh U S involvement in Latin America since uh all this Middle East crisis began 
 So I haven't really paid that much attention like since back in August when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on uh Iraq 
 and the the last thing that I remember hearing that much about is the Iran Contra scandal that happened in the Reagan presidency 
 Can you think of anything else that's happened recently
 Uh-huh
 Well the only uh references that I have seen lately has been uh in part of 
 the overmilitarization of Iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things 
 and they made references to in the past how we have given arms to uh Nicaragua and to other places in Latin America and that those might turn around and haunt us someday
 I mean not to this large scale as Iraq 
 but that 
 whenever we give arms to people as we did and as we sold arms pardon me to Iraq when we wanted them to fight Iran uh and then it turn around and 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 And I know when I spent 
 the time that I've studied in Mexico uh Spanish was one of my majors in college uh there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards America
 about uh like you say using them yo- 
 our interest there is you know what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them
 and we weren't normally very interested in them 
 and they have 
 other in most Latin American countries there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries you know 
 they have corruption 
 and they don't have uh 
 I mean there's just very few really modern cities
 Uh-huh
 Well that's right 
 because that's just so much of the way that they make their money 
 and so many communities uh have to have that for farming 
 And they don't look at it so much as you know 
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 And I think it's really very sad that north of the border you know the United States and Canada is so different from South America and Central America 
 There's really a disparity between uh what I would call civilization of the countries you know
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 it's really kind of sad that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and uh Israel and the Middle East Arab countries when we have a lot of problems right in our own back door
 Um
 So I guess we've kind of neglected Latin America
 Ri- 
 recently 
 Yeah 
 fairly recently 
 Well that's really sad 
 I hadn't thought about that in a long time
 Well I guess then I will go 
 but I 
 made me stop and think a minute about not worrying so much about the Middle East crisis 
 I know that it's not settled but there are other areas that we could focus our attention on
 Well thank you 
 you have a good day
 Bye-bye
