 Hello
 Hi Nola 
 I'm Steve 
 I'm in Dallas Texas
 No 
 that's unusual
 Seems like usually 
 Oh yeah <> 
 I think all mine have been East Coast people so far 
 So 
 social changes
 what's that mean 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I definitely 
 I mean there's plenty of things to talk about there 
 That's a 
 Yeah 
 sure
 Uh I was hoping that you would 
 but oh 
 In social changes is that 
 uh it seems to me that uh 
 Does that 
 Yeah 
 Like a lot 
 it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is even more true today You know
 S- 
 Yeah 
 It's like people are starting to give up hope 
 and they start out very poor 
 Let's see 
 that's a bad tangent to get on 
 What else has changed between the sixties and the eighties and the nineties 
 No
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It seems so that 
 yeah 
 that is a pretty big change 
 It seems even not just single parent families but with no guidance 
 but it seems like some of these even ladies that'll work and have a baby and then you know after two or three months go back to work You know 
 well I mean that's very young for a baby 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I mean they're going to 
 like you said I mean they might be saving money 
 I mean even if they had to pay more now I mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work Even though it's higher productivity is short-term
 Yeah
 yeah 
 Oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment 
 Huh It 
 Yeah 
 It's interesting w- uh 
 home study Is that what you said 
 Home school
 uh is it like uh a preschool level then or through grade school or 
 Oh I s- 
 Oh well you sound busy 
 So you're teaching them completely <>
 Huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 That's pretty sad because I mean I don't know something's got to change with the schools 
 That's what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway
 When they're young 
 Yeah <>
 Yeah
 Changing people's expectations
