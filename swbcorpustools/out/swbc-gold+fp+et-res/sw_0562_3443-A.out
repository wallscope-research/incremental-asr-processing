 Surprised they get anybody this time of day 
 but I've been trying all different times
 but I don't get anybody at five thirty don't get anybody at nine at night 
 so thought I'll try 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Well I go to school 
 so I'm home certain days
 and uh I really haven't been making any phone calls have you 
 Got 
 Oh 
 have you received many
 Yeah
 it's uh 
 well the first time we were on this it came just about every day
 I never had to make one 
 They just always came 
 People must be tired of it or something
 well anyway I guess we're supposed to discuss this uh subject 
 what do you think 
 Oh 
 Well I don't have any objection to people doing that 
 I think it might be good for them
 But as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent
 I'm just concerned about their safety 
 because if they do good work in America they'll probably be sent to a ghetto 
 And if they were sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait worried you know
 That that would be my main objection 
 Uh *[[slash error]] I don't think 
 it will probably never happen 
 but 
 Yeah 
 well it probably won't
 I don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway 
 We can't uh seem to pay for all the little things we have going now 
 That's another consideration 
 But uh I don't know 
 some kids are so spoiled nowadays 
 it might be a real eye opener you know 
 I mean sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here 
 and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes 
 and then they think 
 they're just kind of shocked at that side of town you know 
 I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl 
 Oh 
 Well that would be an eye opener wouldn't it
 I mean right next to us is such a pitiful country
 I know 
 Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world and helping some countries I never even heard of
 It seems to me we are 
 it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country Right on our borders
 But what do I know right 
 I'm just sitting at home and uh doing laundry today and certainly not up 
 nobody has called me from Washington 
 Oh but uh anyway how did you get on this program
 Oh you do work at T I 
 Oh you're in Lewisville
 Oh yeah 
 I just went by that place 
 We were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost 
 and uh we went by 
 That's the first time I'd seen it 
 It looked really nice
 A lot of trees there 
 It looked like a sight
 Sure
 Oh sure 
 Di- 
 Well my husband works at T I over on Central
 Uh why we're living in Arlington I'm not so sure 
 but he works over there 
 and tha- 
 we did it last time
 uh so just my daughter and I are registered this time 
 I don't know 
 they didn't even ask him back 
 That was weird wasn't it
 But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time
 And I can never find anybody
 So um 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I've had the same experiences
 all right around here
 Yeah 
 I don't know uh 
 I wonder if they really 
 I don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents
 there's so many with this one town you know
 even in some families some people talk a little bit different
 My husband is from New Jersey 
 and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me 
 and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way 
 and that's one family right 
 Of course I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny 
 but 
 You know how that goes 
 Oh God 
 Well I'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet 
 Sometimes she says at night or overloads 
 so please end your conversation
 Right 
 Well do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject 
 You don't have any kids you want to send over here 
 Well is 
 Well uh I don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto 
 Well one of them is real idealistic 
 she might
