 Okay 
 Uh do you own a P C by the way 
 I'm guessing you probably do
 Oh
 I see
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 And what kinds of things do you use it for when you go to them 
 Yeah
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Great
 Yeah
 Oh sure
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well I tell you once you get used to having them you get spoiled really quickly
 Uh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Um I'm a writer by profession 
 and uh when I was first here in Dallas or in Plano um this is oh been like fourteen years ago we moved here And I was finally able to afford a new typewriter and I got an I B M Selectric I thought I had died and gone to heaven because I thought oh they're so wonderful
 Well then um 
 Yeah 
 ours really needs to have some work done on it 
 but then my husband um worked at T I 
 um this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore but he got the T I professional and brought that home 
 and I learned Wordstar on that
 and boy once that happened there was just no way that I could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Have you ever used WordPerfect 
 Or 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 That's probably where you've used it
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah Um 
 I have that on my uh computer here 
 and also um I do some work at U T D 
 and uh that's what they have there 
 and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and you know already know the software 
 And um I don't know from my own experience um 
 WordPerfect is just so much better than Wordstar at least the version of Wordstar that I used to have 
 It may be improved by now 
 but 
 Yeah 
 uh Wordstar was never very intuitive to me 
 I mean you know you 
 some of the commands just had nothing to do with you know what they did on the computer 
 but uh 
 I mean like going um forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just you know didn't match with the kinds of keys you were using
 Yeah
 but WordPerfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways 
 and it does a lot of things too that if you do any kind of uh research or anything like that where you have to uh use footnotes it is just wonderful Because it keeps track of all your footnotes
 Yeah 
 and if you put a footnote in the middle you know if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it um it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you
 So you know it's just 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 And I think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything 
 and oh it was just awful 
 So um I don't know I think we have just become really spoiled 
 But I think it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled 
 So um well I have not really paid much attention because I 
 clock 
 although I think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes 
 so um um unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with P Cs 
 Well um I was a technical writer for many years um
 and my husband and I actually met in a computer company 
 Um I was a tech writer 
 and he was an engineer uh so I did tech writing for a number of years
 Oh sure
 Got a problem huh 
 Um
 Oh Trying to figure out what all that was about huh 
 But um I have 
 um that was the majority of my writing although um I have also done oh free lance magazine writing and some educational writing 
 And um for a while I had um uh a partnership in an advertising agency with another woman who is an artist 
 So I did some advertising and P R 
 but 
 um actually I'm not working anymore 
 I'm a graduate student 
 so I'm doing a lot of writing 
 but uh now all of the sc- scholastic majors though 
 I've done a lot of different kinds 
 but I just know right now that I couldn't have put out half of what I did if that much without the being in computers 
 so that's been really great 
 so I'm real spoiled
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Good
 That's great
 Yeah
 Well those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on 
 and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children 
 So um I think that that would be a real uh advantage to her to have that and uh do it early 
 so Uh d- 
 Oh neat
 Yes
 Right
 Oh great
 Right 
 That's great
 Well that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life 
 so Might as well start now huh 
 Well Nola I have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly 
 This is really going to be fun I think
 and um my husband is a ham radio operator 
 and I think about all the people that he talks to all over the
