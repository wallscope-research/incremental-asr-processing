 Okay 
 so we've got to talk about music
 And um do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind
 No 
 not a seventies baby 
 Is it disco 
 or is it like 
 but 
 Oh okay 
 so they can get like the Doors and Led Zepplin
 Yeah 
 that's cool
 And how about the Rolling Stones
 Oh that's when they toured 
 How about um Pink Floyd
 Okay 
 so then we got some same things 
 because 
 No 
 it's very hard 
 because see well I mean in the whole spectrum I'd rather listen you know 
 I listen to heavy metal or classic rock
 We're talking about what they call hard rock
 Like for example let's see uh Bad Company 
 what 
 well they're like for example A C D C
 Why 
 have you heard of them
 Okay 
 And stuff like that 
 that's not really hard rock
 Okay
 Well Cinderella is hard rock heavy metal
 But see for example they have see what 
 but other bands consider it like really hard rock 
 It's like brash metal which all they do is like they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar 
 and the guitar is set like really low
 and what happens is like oh everybody gets like totally into the music 
 and then they start dancing around
 and they just bump into each other
 like they hit each other with their shoulders
 and then you knock people down 
 and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people
 No 
 I don't like that music
 But that's what they do 
 that's what some people call like really heavy metal
 And see the difference I guess between hard rock and heavy metal is the lyrics also 
 Like really like heavy metal is considered like the words heavy metal 
 and like you always thought about like suicide And killing people and stuff like that
 And just hard rock has 
 they don't talk about that 
 they just talk about like life in general
 Like Queen's Reich if you ever heard of them
 Yeah
 Okay 
 well no 
 I said Queen's Reich 
 oh but you got to like Queen also
 So because 
 Yeah 
 especially uh oh God what is it A Night At The Opera 
 Don't they have a 
 no 
 let's see the one that they have the whole opera singing in the background
 Bohemian Rhapsody
 Yeah 
 that was great 
 I heard that the other day on the radio 
 and I pumped it up
 Because I mean I just love that song
 Yeah 
 but they had 
 that whole record was pretty good 
 But then they started going downhill like everybody else
 Yeah 
 they're still around 
 they've got a new C D out 
 but I wouldn't buy it 
 Because see what happens is the old see whe- 
 I like the old Rolling Stones 
 I don't like the new stuff
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well for example I used to like old Phil Collins
 An old Genesis
 *[[listen]] and then what happened was that Phil Collins said hey I can make money a lot of money doing this 
 and then he came out with uh see for example his record like No Jacket Required
 That was good 
 but it was on his way of going downhill 
 because he said I can make a lot of money just singing alone 
 and then he came out with the Invisible Touch with uh Genesis 
 and that really 
 like now I hate Phil Collins 
 I can't stand him
 Because I look at him 
 and I say you know you were singing at this time and with these people 
 and you were great 
 and now you're singing all this stuff that doesn't matter what you sing or what you record 
 it's still going to be a number one hit 
 And so that's what gets me mad
 But did you go see that new Doors movie
 Yeah 
 I saw it when it opened
 Yeah 
 Well you know it's like I was watching Siskel and Ebert *[[slash error]] you know like those guys that criticize movies
 And they both loved the movie right
 They said the music's great 
 it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that
 And then one of them said well everything is great 
 but I'm going to give it thumbs down 
 And they go 
 but why 
 Because like the end is like really depressing 
 And so 
 like the movie is so well made 
 and the music that goes with it just picks you up see 
 I was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine
 I mean so for me 
 No 
 but you learn to 
 I mean it's just that like the sixties music's got a lot to say
 I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too 
 You know I was like 
 Hey 
 but I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants
 Yeah 
 yeah
 did you go to college
 Oh that's cool
 Okay
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Well they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in progression ever in history 
 So 
 No 
 about everything
 So it's like nothing happened during the seventies 
 Everything happened during the sixties 
 the seventies I don't know what they're called you know 
 it's like 
 the eighties are called like the progressive years or you know like the technology years because of all the computers and stuff 
 But the seventies got nothing 
 I mean nobody cared to name it 
 So
 Yeah 
 I know
 Can you imagine like a big picture of John Travolta ta-da what is it SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER 
 Him just standing there
 Yeah 
 that's a good example to look for in history 
 Well from now on we're going to go from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first step on the moon to nineteen eighties 
 Okay 
 what happened in the middle 
 Don't worry 
 don't worry 
 you're not missing anything you know 
 so 
 Yeah 
 really 
 And that's why I guess everybody 
 yeah 
 it's like they don't want to talk about that 
 so they just don't name it 
 I mean I guess it was pretty bad times
 Oh well let's see 
 yeah 
 okay 
 we've been talking for seven minutes 
 so 
 Okay 
 all right 
 so um I'm going to leave you alone 
 Uh what are you doing 
 Do you have a family
 Okay
 Oh I'm sorry
 Oh okay
 Okay 
 All right
 So then uh have fun doing this 
 It is not that bad 
 Bye bye
