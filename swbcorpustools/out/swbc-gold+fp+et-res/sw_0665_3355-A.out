 actually when I'm home alone which isn't too often uh our Public Radio Station has wonderful classical music 
 It's just very wonderful Soothing and you know uh lot of symphonies 
 and I love that 
 that's probably my all-time favorite
 Um
 Right
 Right
 Relax
 Yeah
 What do you teach what grade
 Good for you
 A certain subject
 Good for you
 I was just sitting here while she was trying to find another caller {F uh 
 } I was reading 
 my husband and I are taking a computer class at our junior college 
 Yeah 
 it's pretty good 
 it's just a real basic class 
 but we're learning a lot 
 and we have a home computer 
 so it's very interesting
 Yeah 
 the subject of music 
 I play piano 
 I took lessons for thirteen years 
 and right now my nine year old is taking piano 
 and I just got a whole mess of music 
 volunteer to play the piano at the children's Christmas program for the whole grade school which is K through six five hundred kids
 I did it last year 
 and um I just sub at the school 
 I don't want to work full time 
 so I just sub at the school 
 and that's kind of my volunteer thing 
 so it's really neat 
 and my older daughter plays the saxophone 
 my next son plays the drums 
 and my third son just started baritone this year 
 and my little girl will start French horn next year 
 so 
 Oh
 French horn is absolutely wonderful instrument 
 It's just my favorite 
 Of course that's what I played 
 and so I'm pushing that on my daughter because I want to play in our city band not the symphony with just the city band once we get the the French horn 
 and I get a little bit more time 
 Right now I'm busy chasing my kids
 I love it 
 but we have a marvelous band instructor 
 and he's wonderful 
 We have uh couple of hundred kids in the band 
 our junior high band is just wonderful
 He lot 
 and their concert band 
 and then he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in 
 and my son will be in next year 
 that's 
 I mean they play college level music in junior high 
 he's that good of an instructor 
 and the kids just love him
 So it's really good 
 It is wonderful
 Oh do you 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
