 Well um Minneapolis isn't too bad 
 Uh I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders
 Uh that's kind of gone up in scale and some other things 
 Uh I personally had a little experience the other day 
 Uh somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck
 But actually you know when you look at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live it's really quite a bit better Uh because I came from Florida 
 and in Orlando crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever 
 so 
 What part of California are you from 
 Oh really 
 I have a good friend there 
 Yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that's <> 
 That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like 
 Sure 
 Well uh interestingly enough right before I moved up here 
 I'm an intern 
 and then I go back down in May 
 Uh but in Orlando before I moved up we had a real problem with it 
 Uh we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks 
 And one of the things that I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there 
 Uh because they were just 
 it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work you know 
 and then the houses were left unguarded uh 
 but yeah 
 I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it 
 that's a good way to work it with a neighborhood watch
 Oh is that right 
 Oh
 That's amazing
 Yeah
 Uh 
 Yeah 
 it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter
 Really you know 
 Yeah 
 unfortunately it's starting to really you know look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day
 Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit
 and uh the crime level there of course is quite a bit uh more pronounced uh
 but uh yeah 
 I guess
 I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis 
 I'm not real sure Uh 
 Pretty much
 Yeah 
 I was basically involved in that in the organization of it
 And then I left right in the middle of it 
 I'm not sure where we went from there 
 but 
 Yeah 
 that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious uh activities like that sure 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited
 even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps 
 it's against the law to do a lot of things you know 
 They could basically uh 
 when I was getting robbed down in Florida I was really considering electrifying doors um things like that like 
 they did in Miami that time
 That's not always true
 No 
 there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed 
 and essentially what he had done is set a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home
 The guy came in while he was home 
 and sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned 
 He didn't die 
 but he was severely burned 
 and he took the guy to court and won a settlement
 Yeah 
 So that makes you think you know
 It's like your hands are very much tied
