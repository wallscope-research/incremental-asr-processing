 All right 
 well I'm not a big exerciser 
 but I kind of had to start after I had my baby because I wanted to lose that extra weight
 And so basically at this point I'm a real walker
 Are you
 I don't do oh I guess I'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips you know and keep their arms up 
 I don't do that 
 I mostly just take a walk around the block or with my baby 
 you know and I have to do that at least once a day If it's going to make any effect on since I have to eat the same as I did before 
 I can't neglect that because of the baby either
 uh well she was premature 
 so she's about nine months now though 
 Goll- times goes fast
 Oh that's great
 Uh-huh
 Oh my goodness
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Exactly
 Uh-huh
 Well I think that is just wonderful 
 Now as far as I'm concerned I have several other children 
 and so uh I think at this point to fit it to other things it's kind of a task
 You know Uh it's not to where I'm just so freed up that I just go oh this is wonderful 
 let's go 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Now does your husband usually go with you then
 Oh see now that's really nice
 Because mine's at meetings sometimes 
 and he's not really into it 
 so I have to 
 Uh-huh
 I think that is so wonderful
 I bet 
 I think that's really really good 
 and you know I think after you've done it a certain amount of time it kind of does get to be a routine
 It's not 
 like when I first started it you know that was the hardest thing was to get ready and get out there 
 But now if I haven't done it in a day or two or something I really notice that I haven't done it in a 
 You know And I like the time because my kids sometimes they come with me 
 and sometimes they don't 
 And when they don't I really notice you know how fun it can be when they come 
 So uh I like to have somebody come with me
 Uh I know enough of the people that if anything ever happened I could go to a home around this block area 
 So it's not real dangerous 
 but still I don't like to go alone
 So <> 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 You know
 Well I think that's great 
 and well sometimes when I take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise I really think I do 
 I was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing
 Uh I found real quick that wasn't for me
 Uh-huh <>
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Right 
 right 
 And it gives me time to think 
 So I think not only does it help my body 
 but I think it helps my mind too 
 So I like that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 need something 
 and 
 They can wait until you get back home
 Well I think that's great 
 Well that's what I do for 
 Okay
