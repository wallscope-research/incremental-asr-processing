 I don't have one in my home here 
 My um parents have one 
 and they live just about three miles away
 so we use that one
 And my in-laws also have one 
 and they're almost as close
 They're in Richardson
 Um usually uh word processing something um such as oh forms for things uh 
 also I have a nine year old that I've been home schooling for the last three years
 And we got 
 uh the one that my parents have is an Apple Two E
 And I have a sister-in-law who works in the Fort Worth school district
 And so she got me copies of uh several of the Apple for school programs 
 and so we use those 
 and there's some 
 whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game 
 so that's part of it 
 Um my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things Uh his resume his uh letter 
 he's been applying for jobs and things that type of thing Uh forms for his photography business and that kind of thing
 Yeah
 I'm uh 
 my father had a software company
 and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that
 and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing here 
 But um they're kind of older 
 so I'm not sure that we'll be able to get too many other programs for it
 Oh
 I have one of those 
 Yeah
 Mines broke at the moment 
 but 
 Oh
 Yeah 
 I learned Wordstar uh 
 I did some typing for my father when he had the company
 and so I learned that on there too 
 that was 
 I haven't 
 That's the one that my father 
 well I guess I have used it once or twice
 Uh it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer
 He's got on I B M
 uh so that's the program that they're using there
 That's what I've heard
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 you had to memorize it
 and 
 Oh
 Oh that's neat
 Oh how wonderful
 I had heard that That was a better one 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I agree 
 Not too much 
 what kind of things do you write
 Oh 
 <> Go talk to Daddy about it
 Excuse me
 <> Go on and talk to Daddy about it 
 Tell Daddy I unplugged it for you 
 But you don't need to drag it down the hall 
 Daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that I had unplugged 
 Yeah
 Huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I'm anxious some day to have one here
 I'm 
 and they just talked the other day about setting something up again 
 so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing 
 My nine year old I've decided to teach her how to type using the computer 
 so 
 Yeah
 I've 
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 we've been uh writing a story together
 and I wanted her to put it into the computer and then print it out and make a book with it you know
 And so I decided well if she's going to do that it would be a whole lot easier if she could type 
 So we'll slowly learn just to type here and then put the story in
 Yes 
 yes
 I agree
 Yeah
