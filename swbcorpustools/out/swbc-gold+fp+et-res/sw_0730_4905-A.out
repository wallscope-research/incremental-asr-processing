 Okay 
 Uh I just currently quit my job 
 and so I really don't receive any benefits right now 
 But my husband does 
 and uh I think one of the uh my 
 first of all always salary and se- 
 the second thing is uh because we have children 
 so it would be uh health benefits and medical benefits 
 and uh right now we have probably some excellent benefits right now 
 We have with Aetna 
 and uh I don't know if you're familiar with them 
 but we're real happy with them
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Huh 
 Right 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Right 
 Uh and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices on who to go with
 And that really helped us out a great deal/
 So 
 But my husband does get vacation 
 and it's worked out really good for us too
 So 
 But 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's great that you all can work that out 
 That's really good 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It's the same with my husband cause he's got pretty flexible hours as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do 
 Worked out really well for us too
 Uh Well is there anything else that you look for 
 or 
 You've hit pretty 
 you've put a lot of the main points in
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 And that does make a person want to stay
