 Okay 
 Uh well since I initiated the call I guess I'll start off first 
 Uh number one I have absolutely no problem with random testing Uh 
 I spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job 
 and I feel I would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for particularly airline pilots and such 
 I'd feel much more comfortable than I do now based on what I've been hearing in the newspapers 
 So I really don't have a problem with it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well I happen to be uh 
 my job is I'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world's largest paint company 
 so I 
 it's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause this type of thing 
 And even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs 
 and we at the present time do not have random testing
 And I am pushing towards that 
 I honestly feel if people have nothing to hide they shouldn't have a problem with it
 And if they are trying to hide something then I have to know that because we're talking major liabilities 
 Not only with themselves but with other employees
 And I really you know 
 they're talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that I would much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested on a random basis 
 I have a real fear 
 but that at some point something's going to happen 
 And they're showing it with AIDS 
 so why you know 
 they ought to start doing something with the drugs 
 So I really have no problem with it
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Oh really
 Well that scares me because if that's the way they are 
 I 
 if I were a dentist I'd want to be protected too
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well where you're located I do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing
 And I think they've had it for several years 
 And they're program they had I don't think had a lot of uh problems associated with it 
 but uh my brother-in-law happens to work there 
 and it sounded very positive 
 And I think it's great 
 I would encourage it 
 I'm pushing our company towards that 
 Right
 Exactly
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Ours is changing 
 Yeah 
 ours is changing 
 it's increasing 
 I live in a very nice suburb 
 and it's unbelievable what's going on and the selling of drugs 
 it's just too loose 
 It's too free
 Uh-huh
 Really
