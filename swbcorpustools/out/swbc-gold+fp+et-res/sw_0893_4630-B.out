 You don't get any newspapers
 I'm kind of the opposite of you 
 I get all my news from newspapers 
 we have two newspapers
 Yeah 
 Two newspapers in the morning
 And uh I'm uh in a government position that I'm in the news a lot 
 so uh I kind of look through to see what uh I'm quoted in
 But uh how bad the quotes are every day 
 Yeah
 Or uh sometimes there's uh letter to the editor about me 
 or there's a even uh editorials for and against what I'm doing 
 uh but uh the T V I don't really watch even if I'm on it 
 But just 
 Right
 And that's 
 C N N had the {F uh 
 } everybody was watching C N N 
 that seemed to be the place to be to find out what was going on on that
 At that point I was watching the T V On something like that
 Well the thing is with T V I uh 
 a lot of times the news on uh the local T V is so brief you really don't get the full picture of uh what's going on 
 And uh that's a problem that I have is not getting just a little brief uh idea of what's happening 
 But 
 Right 
 But I like the weather report
 So I wa- 
 I always turn that on 
 that's one part I watch because uh I go surfing down here 
 and I always want to watch the weather for when the waves are going to be good
 Yeah 
 No 
 Right on the south Florida coast Where the weather is still warm here
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Weather channel's good <>
 Yeah
 I mostly look for the storms out in the ocean Uh hundreds of miles out 
 so I can predict my week and where I'm going to be
 So I can be at the beach when the waves start coming in
