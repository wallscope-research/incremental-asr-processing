 Uh-huh
 Ah 
 Boy you and my husband would have a whole lot in common 
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 What's the 
 how old is your car
 Oh
 Yeah 
 Right 
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 So what do the Miatas run
 Well that's not too bad
 Yeah 
 Really 
 I've never driven one
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 And so you've done this
 Oh 
 Okay
 Oh 
 Really 
 Yeah 
 <> Whatever my husband buys 
 Oh not too much 
 No 
 uh we just got rid of a full conversion van that wasn't me 
 That was my husband
 He wanted a van 
 and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there T V you know the whole bit
 But I never drove it 
 so it just wasn't me you know
 And then Oh I'd want a minivan 
 Because I'm with the kids all the time
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 And 
 Yeah 
 I pick up my little one from preschool 
 and the whole parking lot's full of minivans/
 But you know I drive a little Subaru
 And uh I love that 
 I 
 we were going to trade that in for the van 
 but I just wanted to hold on to it cause I just really enjoy that
 And uh that's really all I needed was for something just to go here and there and back 
 Uh-huh
 Oh really 
 Oh really
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 It's amazing what a minivan can do 
 We went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan And pulled uh the little trailer behind
 The pop-up trailer
 And uh it's 
 so it's really amazing how much a minivan can do
 No 
 they're not
 They're probably 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 And we do a lot of uh driving 
 We do a lot of traveling By car 
 And so that's the only time that the uh conversion van came in handy 
 But it really didn't cause our kids are still little
 So uh that was the only time we really needed it 
 Other than that it got terrible mileage 
 and 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
