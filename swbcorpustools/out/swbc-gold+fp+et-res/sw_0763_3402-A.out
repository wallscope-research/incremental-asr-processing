 All right 
 I guess tonight's subject is to discuss current events and how we keep up on current events and if we're satisfied with the uh coverage that we receive
 Um thinking about it some of the ways I try and keep up on current events is uh I enjoy reading the newspaper but uh quite often don't have time to read all of the newspaper 
 and so uh I enjoy watching some of the T V highlights and also uh some of the news periodicals uh weekly magazines 
 and uh at work I also have uh management summary reports that uh give basically a lot of the current events 
 Uh how about yourself
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Oh yeah 
 Okay 
 You think that that's uh pretty adequate coverage 
 and you get 
 Uh-huh
 It's historic events huh
 Oh okay
 Yes
 Yeah
 Um I found out too that uh quite often if I see something on television that I want more in-depth uh understanding or want to know more about it that the newspaper or uh NEWSWEEK can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what I've heard on T V 
 but uh um I found out that also on T V that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on C N N 
 and like you said the news shows that are happening 
 and you can read some more about it if you want to 
 Um I found out though that 
 or I feel that a lot of the stuff on T V and the newspapers is negative 
 There's an awful lot of negative news or bad news 
 And it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news
 And uh 
 Yes 
 we do
 True 
 true
 Uh-huh 
 I've heard an interesting comment also that uh with budget cuts and uh expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or uh investigative reporting on certain topics and issues 
 but that takes time 
 that takes an awful lot of money and commitment 
 and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing
 and you know it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer and uh find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things 
 so I don't know 
 I guess the economy is effecting also the news media
 and we have to pay that price 
 but uh I don't know 
 I don't know 
 It's interesting 
 and I think that nowadays with communications the way they are also that we can see global events happening as they occur all over the world like the 
 Exactly 
 We saw 
 Yes 
 you know twenty years ago thirty years ago we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or luxury to view that 
 So 
 Oh yes
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
