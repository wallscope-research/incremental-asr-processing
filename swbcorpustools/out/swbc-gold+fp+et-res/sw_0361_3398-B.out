 Hello
 Hi
 Hi 
 My name is Lowell 
 and I live in Raleigh North Carolina
 Go right ahead
 I'm single 
 and I live in a town home here in Raleigh 
 and it's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area
 we have a lot of town homes here as well as single family homes 
 and at the time that I bought this one it was just a much better arrangement for me personally 
 I'm not home a lot 
 I travel a great deal with my job 
 so it was easier to have a home exactly that somebody else looks out for the maintenance
 It certainly is
 Well if you ever get one be sure the walls are good and thick because if they're not you can hear 
 that's the main thing when I was shopping for one 
 I wanted to make sure I couldn't hear my neighbors 
 and that was 
 so I bought one that's more like living in a 
 once you're inside you don't know you're in a town home
 It is 
 They're kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of like side by side
 so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you
 Yes 
 definitely
 Well we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees people who don't want the heat of Florida but don't want the cold of the northeast 
 so they settle sort of in-between
 Yes
 as a matter of fact uh this particular community that I live in is very wooded
 It is nice
 Uh we definitely have a lot of trees here
 Yes 
 but fortunately the home owner's association does all that
 Yes 
 I don't have to worry about that 
 and this is the time of year we're starting to lose 
 they're all falling now
 Right
 No 
 I don't think so
 It was good to speak with you too
 Thank you 
 you too
 Bye-bye
