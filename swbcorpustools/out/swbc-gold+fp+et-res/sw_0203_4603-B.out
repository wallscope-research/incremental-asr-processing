 Okay 
 Go ahead

 I think that might be referring to uh something kind of uh alternative to the draft you know 
 Either you have uh military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years 
 Right 
 right
 Huh Right 
 right
 Well i- 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 i- 
 for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative uh public service for uh young people to go into uh after high school
 Uh kind of in lieu of the draft for people uh who you know are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise want to be in the military you know 
 Say okay 
 well you can go into the military 
 or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and learn about things 
 And it's interesting because I'm not a particular fan of the military 
 but I have seen a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined you know even just personal discipline about what they want to do 
 and they come out 
 and now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline 
 And uh you know in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can see that you know if I do something or submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time I can accomplish a lot 
 and it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn That they don't need to be you know cowboys 
 They don't need to be out there uh you know constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished
 And you know for some young men that's good 
 For me it would have been lousy idea uh because I did have the personal discipline 
 And I went to college for four years and got out you know 
 But uh you know for some people that's good 
 I don't particular like the fact that it's the military you know 
 and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially as an instrument of U S policy 
 Well that's one view 
 you know and that's another debate 
 But uh it's uh 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right <> 
 and well it seems pretty aggressive oriented 
 I mean you look at the last military action which was in the Persian Gulf and wasn't anywhere near the United States 
 and uh you know it was definitely a projection of U S power on the other side of the globe 
 so at any rate this is getting off the topic 
 but i- 
 my point was that for people who don't want to do the military service it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and uh sense of community that the Boy Scouts
