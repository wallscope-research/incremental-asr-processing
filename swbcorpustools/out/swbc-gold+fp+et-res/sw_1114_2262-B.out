 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Well I live out in the country
 so that part is good 
 Uh we're maybe one hundred miles from Pittsburgh 
 which has a lot of pollution from their plants
 and right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator
 *[[sp: we're]] And uh it won't be too for from where we live 
 *[[sp: far]] And everybody really has been you know fighting against it because we do not want it 
 Well we don't want one any place 
 we would like the uh industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration because we feel that uh the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much 
 You know *[[slash error]] Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Oh that has to be terrible over there
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 we're breathing it all the time
 Huh-uh 
 No 
 And I figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste no matter who does it 
 [ So + *[[slash error]] and ] they have shown some of the industries have been real good at uh uh doing their part in uh reducing the amount that they have
 *[[sd]] Uh they've reused some of it uh 
 it can be recycled a lot of their things
 and that they've shown that uh to begin with apparently it does cost more
 but once they get started it saves them money in the end 
 and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way
 And if they would all 
 that's what we want done 
 we want industry to take you know more responsibility in taking care of it
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 they're greedy 
 It's money is what is 
 it's the money
 They're making fantastic amounts on these things 
 and uh even the incinerator the money and the income that they're going to make off this is you know just astronomical
 We've never been 
 we went as far as uh like Las Vegas and Yellow Stone Park
 we should have gone the whole way over 
 but we didn't
 But I understand that 
 we have an aunt that lives out there 
 and When she was visiting here she would look up at the stars 
 and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw
 She said they couldn't see those things out there because of the smog and everything
 No 
 Never been in New York 
 I don't want to go there 
 Have you been there
 Oh
 Um no 
 I never heard of that one
 We're near Pittsburgh Clarion University
 it's kind of northwest part of Pennsylvania
 Huh-uh *[[slash error]] You sound very young 
 *[[slash error should be sv]] Are you a young person
 Thirty-one 
 you're young 
 No 
 you're young 
 You have a lot of life yet
 and these 
 we have some people who say well this isn't going to affect me this air pollution
 uh older people 
 or they think they're far enough away from something that it's 
 and they don't realize these things are going to affect everybody 
 And if you're older it's not going to affect you that way 
 You have grandchildren 
 you have children uh
 Nieces nephews whatever friends 
 Uh everybody is going to be affected by it
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 They say it has really made a difference though
 Now see we don't have that here yet
 No 
 we don't have that testing in that down here yet
 But they 
 I have read that it has really helped where where the population is greater 
 and that it has made a difference
 Huh-uh 
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Something is coming out 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 If you have to put a price on it Which is more valuable life or paying a little more
 Huh-uh 
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Yeah 
 And like I said I think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because it's industry 
 We're paying industry to make the products 
 and we're helping pay for there making these end products that are toxic waste 
 Then we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace 
 then they put it in the dump some place 
 and they find out well this dump doesn't work 
 so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else 
 We end up paying for it again 
 Now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators
 And we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted
 Or the 
 the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the two water sheds that feed Clarion river 
 And you know it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there because if that water gets contaminated it will go on down to Pittsburgh 
 It will you know 
 it affects so many people
 And it's just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this
 Huh-uh
 It really is
 It is really a concern
 So *[[slash error]] Huh-uh
 Well you too
 Huh-uh
 Bye
