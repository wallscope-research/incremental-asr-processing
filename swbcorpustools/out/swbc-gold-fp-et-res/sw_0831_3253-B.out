 Hi
 When I think of camping I think of bugs and sleeping bags and tents like along the Appalachian Trail
 No
 I have never been camping 
 No 
 Do you do much
 Really
 Where you live now 
 or Did you camp up in Maryland 
 or 
 okay
 I bet
 Uh-huh
 okay 
 Well my husband and his uncle especially grew up camping together 
 and they just love it 
 and they're planning a trip into Canada I guess in about a year 
 and they're going to spend about a week and a half camping up there
 No 
 this is a man's trip 
 So they're really looking forward to that
 so 
 And see I was never exposed to it
 so 
 I feel like I'm a little bit too much of a city mouse to try doing it 
 What's the best part about it to you the quiet the getting away
 Wow
 Now like do you usually go and there's lots of other people around 
 or is it pretty much isolated
 Yeah
 Yes
 good grief
 that does sound neat 
 but I don't think I've got quite enough nerve to do that
 I know my husband's gone for several days on the Appalachian Trail before 
 and he said that a lot of times you can go for you know a good day before you'll see or meet anybody else on the trail
 So it's not for the faint of heart I don't think
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 I think it would be
 yeah
 Well that sounds really neat
 Well I don't know 
 we talk about sometimes going up to Chincoteague
 and I 
 maybe like you said start out slow and kind of get used to it and find out that maybe it's not as bad as I fear it might be 
 Yeah
