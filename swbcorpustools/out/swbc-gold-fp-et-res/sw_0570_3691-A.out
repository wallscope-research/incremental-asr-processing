 You bet 
 They tell you our topic
 You've got it 
 Yes 
 we do 
 my wife and I have a dog that soon be eight years old 
 and we have a cat which is I guess about five years old
 How about you guys
 Three dogs
 And two bi- 
 what kind of birds do you have
 No kidding 
 enjoy them 
 You let them out and let them fly around and everything
 Okay
 You- 
 You know this is like a cruelty joke 
 and I apologize if you're a bird lover 
 but we had a parakeet And my fault put up our first electric fan And never thought about it 
 Knocked that parakeet right out of the air
 It killed him
 that's 
 well it killed ours 
 I'll be darned
 Well speaking of pets I'll tell you my kids are older now 
 both of them are either in or out of college 
 but my son had a Burmese boa constrictor 
 and that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in length 
 and finally my wife bless her heart got rid of it because I didn't really like it
 We also had a 
 one year down in Florida on a vacation for Father's Day my kids years ago maybe ten years ago bought me a skunk from a exotic pet shop 
 like it'd been like deactivated as far as smell and everything 
 and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years 
 and my son left went to school 
 we finally sold his boa constrictor 
 but my son needed some money 
 and we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars
 So when the guy came over he was infatuated by that skunk 
 so I made him a deal 
 I said You take that skunk 
 and he said I'll sell that snake to you for two fifty 
 I said otherwise I'm going to give it to this other man
 So he took the skunk too 
 And the skunk was a decent pet 
 but you know does his little jobbies in the litter box 
 and is 
 And it was sort of a neat 
 but they just stink too much 
 That was sort of fun you know 
 I tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover 
 I use to visualize my wife 
 many times my wife would be lying there on the sofa 
 and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body with his head right on her neck
 and the skunk would be sitting at her feet 
 but the cat would be on the back of the sofa 
 and a dog would be running around crazy 
 gosh 
 my son bought this snake 
 someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school 
 and it was just a small thing then 
 but it got to be pretty big 
 and you know you feed him small mice to big rats and things like that
 it's just too much 
 That snake used to watch our cat walk around 
 I always told my wife 
 I says you know your friend's going to get our cat one of these days 
 me neither
 We're down to a simple dog and cat now 
 and that's the way it should be 
 and 
 Haven't had any parakeets for quite a while 
 birds 
 customer of mine has a parrot 
 and gosh sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot 
 and that was just mind boggling 
 Are you
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 gosh
 That's neat
 Why sure
 Come to my menagerie
