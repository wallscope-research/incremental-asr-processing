 Okay 
 you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team or who you think will be doing well this year
 Are we talking about is this the N B A
 This is College okay 
 Uh-huh
 And see that's probably all I saw 
 we have moved in the last couple years from Utah to Texas 
 and there's so many colleges and universities in Texas we haven't really followed them too much 
 and none of them are our alma mater 
 so that seems to help
 I follow it especially around the playoffs 
 so course I was real familiar with the Utah Jazz 
 and the Mailman or Karl Malone was you know pretty big thing 
 and the Lakers have always been amazing to watch
 I did keep track a little bit of the Mavericks 
 They've not had any good seasons for a long time and have a lot of problems with Tarpley 
 and maybe now that that's over they'll come out of it 
 but 
 Yeah 
 I hope they do something 
 They need to 
 or they're not going to have any of the team left at all
 Yeah 
 Kind of like the Cowboys I guess
 Yeah 
 they coming out of it this year 
 We'll see if it's held on
 The Bulls
 Yeah 
 They'll probably be pretty good 
 Course the Celtics are always really good too with their players
 Be interesting to see how the Olympics does this year with all the N B A players playing on the Olympic team
 So 
 Yeah 
 I don't know how close I'll follow them though 
 And the season hasn't started yet
 I'm usually more the end of the season person 
 and we need to talk about baseball 
 and so 
 Well 
 It's 
 yeah 
 yeah
 it is 
 and that's why I've 
 I guess my mind went blank 
 It's like last season was so long ago 
 and I haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet 
 so 
 But this wasn't a good subject 
 but We'll see how our predictions come true
 Okay 
 it's good talking to you
 All righty 
 bye
