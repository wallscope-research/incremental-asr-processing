 Well I have five
 Right
 Well four of them are grown 
 they're in college or just out of college 
 so I really have just a thirteen year old at home
 Well I work at it 
 I try to fool everybody 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I think you are right 
 because I was an only child too 
 And that's one reason I have so many because I enjoy the big family
 And my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters 
 and so she is sort of like an only child 
 and it's the same type of thing 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 That's exactly how it is you know 
 She's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her 
 When things don't go right she just calls one of them you know
 But yeah 
 it's a little bit difficult though 
 I think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more 
 And 
 we really did not 
 My next oldest daughter that's in college in California is a world twirling champion 
 She twirls a baton 
 and we did a lot of things together
 She and I did a lot of things together and flew 
 we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform
 And that was a lot of fun 
 But I guess you could consider that organized 
 there is a competition all the time
 We were very heavy into that 
 Other than that they were pretty much 
 and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that
 Uh-huh
 Well you can't afford to
 Right 
 Right 
 That's right 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well I know I spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter 
 and my little one also competed because really she had no choice 
 She had to go with me
 So the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and competing 
 and of course the competing itself really didn't matter what it was 
 it was making the friends and going all the places 
 and it was a really neat experience 
 but it took our total time 
 I did not work when I did this 
 Now I do work full-time
 And it's just my thirteen year old and myself 
 and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other 
 So 
 Yeah
 Really
 Well things cost a lot more 
 I don't know how it is in Georgia
 and I don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some
 Is it
 Really
 Right
 That's what I've heard 
 
 Yeah 
 I'm surprised to hear that 
 I've heard very positive things about Atlanta
