 I don't know 
 I grew up in the sixties 
 and at that time it was a changing time for the whole music scene I guess 
 and I grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it I guess for several years after I graduated from college and thereafter 
 but have since 
 I grew up in a small town in southern Oklahoma 
 I have kind of gone back to more of a county flavor in music 
 I'm not quite sure why that is 
 and it seems like almost a opposite 
 but I guess I got away from what I consider to be the pot sounding music 
 It didn't have you know I guess what I was looking for at the time country tell's more of a story 
 It kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up 
 and I've become I guess more of a country fan over the years
 Yeah 
 that was my teenage years 
 I was born in fifty 
 and 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's kind of the way I am
 Uh-huh
 it's got basically an easy rhythm and tone
 And it's fairly well easily something to fall into 
 I'm kind of the say way 
 I've gone through different periods of life in music from pop to classical 
 I guess one of the things that influenced me was that I've worked in radio stations as a D J for all my college years trying to support my way through there 
 and suppor- 
 was support 
 I was influenced by all different kinds of music 
 but basically because that's where I worked 
 And I've developed a real love for classical music in probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was heavy into classical type music 
 He said he used to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music that they were using behind them because they used especially Disney used a lot of classical music behind the cartoons 
 and so consequently we wound up playing a lot of classical music there 
 and I think that got deep seated into me 
 One of things I especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is are those that call on those classical roots I guess Barry Manilow comes to mind for some reason there's not a whole lot of his stuff that I'm real crazy about 
 but he does have some things 
 Chicago had some things
 and I think even Electric Light Orchestra had some real influences by classical music 
 and I'm still 
 my favorite 
 in fact most of my C Ds are classical music
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I'm kind of thinking that's maybe 
 our generation was so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with things now with the music that's behinds them
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 That's their signal
 Yeah
 When did you first take your first piano lesson
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It is a time consumer
 Yeah
 Right
 No 
 it's making that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it 
 I was never able to master all that 
 In fact my brother and sister both they were thirteen sixteen years older than I they went through the parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing
 and when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again 
 they sold the piano 
 and turns out I was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to 
 so I 
 that's one of things I felt like I missed in life 
 and I really 
 in fact one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin that is played on piano 
 you know I can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time to do that
 maybe one of these days I'll 
 you know I'm kind of like you maybe one of these days I'll get around to it 
 I'll do something with the piano 
 but probably not 
 Just never got a chance to come out 
 No
 Well it's a pleasure talking with you
 Best of luck in your graduate school
 Good-bye
