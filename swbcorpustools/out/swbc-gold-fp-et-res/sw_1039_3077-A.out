 Americans like me 
 and whether I night not 
 I think that we're paying too much taxes including taxes in general or income tax 
 and the other thing was do we get what we pay for 
 what is our opinion on that 
 so are you prepared to talk 
 Let me push
 Let me push one here 
 Okay 
 well I can just tell you a little bit about taxes in Texas 
 It's most interesting because we're one of the few if 
 I don't know of any other state does not have a state income tax
 so we don't have a state income tax 
 but we certainly make up for it in other ways here 
 for instance the local sales tax is eight and a quarter percent
 Isn't that awful 
 How about you 
 What do you have there
 Uh-huh
 And you have state income tax also
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 Well it's been 
 people here have this 
 they've been really holding out in the legislature 
 and it's starting to show in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded 
 and I don't know if Texas is ever going to be able to totally avoid having an income tax or not 
 I think eventually they're going to have to do it
 but Do you think you pay too much there 
 or how do you feel about that
 really
 interesting 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 yes 
 we do have tax on clothes
 Uh-huh
 How interesting 
 I guess I didn't realize that
 we don't have tax on groceries for instance 
 Yeah
 Right
 yes 
 yes 
 I should have delineated 
 yet your absolutely right 
 It's the consumable food parts that you know we don't have to pay tax on 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and you really have to watch your bill 
 Sometimes I think it's real interesting to look to see how many things that I buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries 
 And that's when it really starts to add on 
 so that is sort of a help 
 but I don't know 
 it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of tax on any sale as far as I'm concerned 
 It's real interesting this last tax season 
 I'm a student 
 and the last tax season I had just a part time job helping out in a tax office 
 And the woman that owned the office was saying she'd had this business for probably seventeen or eighteen years 
 and she was saying as the years have gone on there are fewer and fewer things that people can take off of their income tax
 And you know if you're not a home owner or if you haven't sold property or have something major like that you know it's just not much else you can do 
 and she said it's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of you know accumulating receipts
 really can't do it any more
 So 
 Uh-huh
 How interesting gosh 
 Where did you go to school
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Well you are the same age as my daughter because she just graduated from college this year too 
 I'm a graduate student having gone back after many years 
 So 
 nevertheless I am a student and poor 
 So you know it's been 
 I guess as far as people like our family we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class Americans with college age students you know 
 and I don't know 
 I guess as you say you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are 
 and 
 yes 
 Absolutely 
 yeah 
 Because it seems like they still come out okay you know
 Yeah
 I kind of have my doubts 
 Uh-huh
 That's 
 Yes 
 Seems that way yeah *[[Should "yeah" be a separate slash unit]]
 that the higher they get the you know 
 at least 
 I don't know 
 it seems like they must feel like they're paid for all of the years of experience or something or just the title sometimes 
 and it doesn't seem fair 
 and I know a lot of people do make money you know in good investments and things like that 
 but I think that's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling and not a whole lot of work 
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Probably not
 Yeah 
 yes 
 or what's left is not going to be worth anything you know in terms of how you can actually use it 
 Yeah 
 right 
 But that's 
 well and 
 That's right 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 that's 
 I haven't heard much in recent years about social security 
 for a while there not too long ago they were saying that the whole system was going to be bankrupt you know before very long because so much was going out for programs that originally it was never intended to be used for Or you know programs just weren't in existence
 and then I 
 it sort of calmed down 
 I haven't heard much lately 
 but if you have talked about that in your classes you know in the last few years I'm sure that you have heard
 Yeah 
 well I don't know 
 I guess we complain about taxes 
 but I guess you know you have to be sort of 
 Yeah 
 you have to appreciate yeah what you do get for them sometimes
 and I guess it's worse you know 
 I'd rather be able to control my money as much as I do with what's left over taxes than to live in England or some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all
 and so you know I guess it's all relative
 That's exactly right
 That's right 
 yeah 
 and I
