 If you want to go first go ahead
 Yeah 
 definitely
 I feel that we've missed as far as the top jobs go You know the higher echelon
 Because if you look at most corporations there isn't a woman you know that's on the board of directors or that type of thing 
 they are mostly all men
 There may be a few but very incidental
 And I really think that it will be a long time probably before we see that 
 In one sense I'm an older person in my fifties so I feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today You know that they are not in the home by choice anymore
 It's mostly you know 
 even if you want to say home you really can't
 You know it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living 
 and I don't think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff you know as far as your medical insurance and just groceries and gasoline and all you know
 So I think that we did come a long way in the sense that you know like you say we're out in the labor force but I think we've lost something too
 Yeah
 That's what I mean 
 and you know there's a lot of truth to that 
 If you are not going to have a family then that's fine 
 then you know a career is a smart choice
 And I think it's great but if you have a family I think you owe the family a responsibility 
 And to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff you know I think that the mother and the child lose 
 and I think that's why there is so many problems you know with kids today 
 because they don't have the family roots anymore 
 You know I'm not saying that it's totally gone but it's nothing like what it used to be You know in that sense
 definitely
 That's right 
 they don't want to take care of the kids And the house and that kind of thing 
 That's very true but then they shouldn't have a family
 That's what I'm saying you know 
 I think it's great that women have a choice today That there are ways to prevent families you know 
 like basically there's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies 
 There is no need to have children if you don't want them
 That's fine 
 that's the freedom of choice
 And I agree with that 
 because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent
 Well I shouldn't say they are not going to be a good parent 
 They won't be a caring parent
 Like they won't have that 
 Right 
 that's what I mean 
 they'll feel like it's a job
 It's not like something that they really wanted 
 Like I had three children 
 and I wanted every one of them
 I'm not sorry I had any of them 
 and I worked third shift for a good part of my life just so I would be home with them
 You know I had to work but I tried to make it as painless as possible
 In fact at one time I worked as a second shift 
 and one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table 
 and the kids were talking daddy this daddy that daddy this daddy that 
 and I was sitting there 
 It was like I didn't belong anymore
 And it was because I had worked for about nine months 
 and when they were coming home I was going to work
 And I wasn't there at supper time or bed time 
 or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they would be coming in the door 
 I would be going out
 So we were 
 I felt I was losing my family
 And that's why I said that's it 
 I either have to quit or you know try something else 
 so I went on third shift
 And I worked that shift for eleven years
 Yeah
 Just so that my kids would have me at home
 You know and I feel that's very important 
 it really is 
 and it's too bad because mothers miss out on so much too
 So in the sense that we've come a long way 
 yes 
 but we've sacrificed a lot to get there
 And I really think that like after the second World War when women went to work in factories and all that that was like out of necessity because the men weren't here anymore
 But then it got to be a point where they got some independence
 Exactly 
 A man can afford the necessities a woman affords the luxuries
 And I notice today kids you know 
 like we had apartments before we had homes
 And we had to walk before we had a car
 And now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday 
 what do they get 
 they get a car
 And to me it's like we've lost our values in this country
 We really have 
 and I'm not trying to be you know a prude or old fashioned or anything but I don't think unless you earn something and you've worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it 
 because while I did this you know no one gave it to me
 You will take better care of that 
 and you will prize that possession More than someone handing something to you
 And it's just like college too 
 I think that if a kid goes to college and you can help them fine but I don't think you should pay the whole way
 Of course
 Sure 
 but I'll bet your values are a lot higher you know and your self esteem and the way you you know think about things is probably a lot more common sense than these kids that don't have that responsibility
 Sure 
 they probably don't even have any
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 and that's what I say you'll be so much better off for it as you get older 
 because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and stuff 
 but it's because you've been there And no one can tell anyone anything
 you know you are going to find out for yourself 
 but I don't think you should just not listen to advice even if you don't take it just listen
 You know there is no harm in that whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid you know Just attention you know
 But really 
 what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing women in politics and president someday maybe 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well I still think people have a choice 
 You know if you can live with it and you know your conscience is clear then all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe Or maybe not 
 I don't know
 no one has said for sure you know
 But 
 Yes 
 yes 
 Which I mean I think it should be anyway
 Yeah
 Because you as an individual what you do that to me is your business
 And 
 Exactly 
 exactly 
 that's
