 Well the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time are crafts 
 and I've been involved in making hat stands and rag dolls and different type hats with flowers and roses you know and that kind of thing straw hats and all that kind of stuff 
 And I enjoy it 
 it's relaxing 
 And you kind of get absorbed in it 
 so the time goes by you know before you realize anything is going on 
 And I play the organ sometimes just for my own satisfaction Not for anybody else's ears 
 because I'm not that good at it 
 but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while
 How about yourself
 Really
 yeah 
 that's neat
 that's great 
 uh-huh
 that sounds nice 
 I like bluegrass too
 Uh-huh
 That's the hard part right
 If you can do things together that really helps a lot
 that's good too
 Uh-huh
 it's good 
 and it's healthy too
 We do that too 
 we have a treadmill and a bicycle and that kind of stuff 
 we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week you know
 Yeah
 And we like movies 
 that ki- 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 yeah 
 that's great too
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 we did some remodeling when we bought a house 
 we put a kitchen in and that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering 
 that's fun
 It is 
 It really is
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 I like things that you know two people can do 
 but I like the quiet of doing things away you know 
 kind of gives you some space for yourself 
 and that's what I find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that I can create 
 and I like to crochet and knit 
 I made some afghans and that kind of stuff 
 I like doing things with my hands
 Yeah
 Yes 
 I love to cook
 Italian food 
 Yeah 
 pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff
 Yeah

 Do you do barbecues
 Well smoking and all that stuff
 Yeah 
 yep
 I lived in Abilene for a little while and worked in the Abilene plant 
 and we used to go to Joe Allen's Barbecue 
 and that was great
 Really great
 they have some nice stuff down there
 I miss it 
 yeah
 I did horseback riding too 
 in fact when my children were growing up we always had horses 
 and that was kind of for them 
 but they weren't as interested in it as we were you know 
 so that was a real 
 I'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that you know 
 we always had horses around 
 and I really enjoyed that
 and I was disappointed when I went to Texas 
 I didn't see that many of them
 Yes 
 I know 
 I know 
 it's true
