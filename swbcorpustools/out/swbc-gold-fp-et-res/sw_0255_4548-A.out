 Well actually 
 I don't think I'm in the majority in Texas 
 I don't think I agree with 
 No
 I wouldn't say that 
 I think I would have said that a few years ago
 When I was younger I thought it was a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have capital punishment 
 but maybe slowly changing my opinion
 I'm not thoroughly opposed to it 
 I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment 
 but I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I certainly don't advocate turning people like that loose
 I'm not sure executing them does anymore than keeping them in jail 
 but 
 Yeah 
 that's a factor 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well I 
 the cost is something 
 but but I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of dealing with crime 
 and I guess I would like 
 I don't know 
 the European countries certainly none of them have capital punishment 
 and they don't have a crime problem either 
 No 
 you can't 
 they don't execute anybody in Britain or France 
 and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either 
 and they don't have the crime problems we do 
 I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two
 I guess what worries me about capital punishment is when I see people enthusiastic about it and sort of bloodthirsty I think it brings out the worst in the people who do the punishing 
 and that bothers me 
 But it 
 but 
 Huh
 Yeah
 Huh
 Well actually I wha- 
 the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else 
 I think it just becomes a symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians 
 so 
 I would like for it to be settled once for all and get in the background while the more important issues get discussed 
 Like I said some years ago I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the civilized western country
 Now I'm not so sure of that 
 I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around
 I guess I'm 
 my view of 
 my 
 I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and that costs and other factors justify executing people
 Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture than anything else 
 and I've also never been a victim although I have two friends whose wives were murdered 
 and I can imagine that for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case
