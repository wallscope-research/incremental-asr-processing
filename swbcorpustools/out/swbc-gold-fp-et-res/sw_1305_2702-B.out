 [Clanking] {dishes} {woman and children} 
 What kind of a car do you have now
 Yeah
 Yeah
 You got kids
 Okay
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Huh
 Well we've always had uh Fords
 Uh mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership 
 Yeah 
 That'll do it 
 Um but yeah we're we're in the same shape 
 I think our next car will be a you know some big old four door uh something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons 
 and we've got a minivan
 and that's great 
 And I d- drive uh 
 well I used to drive an Escort 
 but it died on me
 So I I mean I I I used to run it I uh where we used to live I used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day
 And uh and this Escort took it all 
 And it it it got up to uh uh I was at ninety-four thousand miles on it 
 and the engine just went
 So I I I bought a used uh Dodge Aries which has been okay
 I I mean I've haven't had it that long
 But it it al- it's an eighty-five Aries 
 but it only had thirty-four thousand miles on it when I bought it
 And I just you know I just drive it to work 
 So it's just a ten minute commute every day
 So uh it doesn't get much of uh 
 I mean it's not like I'm putting it through its paces
 But I think uh 
 and it's a four door which is nice
 but it's still a little cramped 
 I've got three kids
 so I I 
 Yeah 
 that's what I was thinking of 
 was a Taurus 
 Uh 
 Oh really
 Yeah 
 Ooh
 Yeah
 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well my wife wants a Miyata
 
 Right
 Right 
 yeah
 I know 
 I know 
 It's like I I guess I could fit in it maybe 
 Yeah
 Oh
 Yeah
 
 Yeah
 
 Oh no
 Yeah 
 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well I 
 you know it's funny 
 Most people that I've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college or you know or when they were single anyway
 They'd they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last 
 I never did that 
 Uh you know my first car was a Toyota Corolla
 And uh because I got a good deal on it 
 and uh that was a great little car 
 Actually I met 
 that's how I met girls was I'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission which I I had never 
 I I'd learned on an automatic transmission And so so I'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car
 And uh in fact I married one of those people 
 And it worked
 Yeah 
 it worked all right real good
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 
 Wow
 That's weird
 Yeah
 Huh
 Yeah
 Well my wife 
 I mean she'd always driven standard transmission
 And uh and 
 in fact all our earlier cars were a standard transmission 
 In fact the minivan's a has a stick shift
 And in 
 this Dodge Aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had anything 
 You know it's got automatic transmission cruise control you know electric locks 
 You know it's like it's like a luxury car except that it's the Dodge Aries you know
 So uh 
 
 Well you um 
 the the thing about this uh th- 
 I will say this about the minivan
 We thought that was a luxury car when we bought it
 It it 
 Yeah 
 And and it was quiet 
 it had a stereo system
 We never had it you know 
 we always had the A M radio
 And uh of course this has this that had s- speakers that you can control from the back seat
 And you can change the channels on the on the radio from the back seat too 
 And put s- speaker phones in it 
 So 
 Right
 That's right 
 That's right
 And you've got to pay for it too
 And I bet and I bet it costs twice as much as as when I bought mine 
 We 
 Nice talking to you
 Thanks a lot
 Bye-bye [
