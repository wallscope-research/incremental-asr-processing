 Well what is your favorite kind of music
 same here
 Yeah
 well I guess I like a wide range everything from Baroque through at least some modern music
 And my wife and I these days are especially into opera 
 We've been sort of opera fans for a few years now
 Well we generally 
 the places we've gone they sing in the original languages
 Like the Dallas opera here normally does I guess
 Well one thing that's helped us a lot is that you know you can buy a lot of these operas now on video tape 
 and so we have quite a collection of those 
 and you watch them at home 
 and they have subtitles 
 so you figure out what's going on after a while 
 and then you can enjoy it in the theater
 But you know the Dallas opera now has super titles on all their performances I think
 Well they give an English translation on a screen up above the stage
 Yeah
 In fact they even do that for operas sung in English because it is hard to understand the words sometimes
 Yeah 
 well I really like Vivaldi 
 he's definitely one of the top of that era
 Uh-huh 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 how old are they
 So they're doing this in school or what
 Uh-huh
 Well you've got half a string quartet there
 Yeah
 Well since you seem to like Italian music have you ever gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era the period right before actually before Vivaldi I guess
 Uh-huh
 yes 
 uh-huh
 No 
 I don't 
 but I think I know what it is 
 Isn't that a see 
 can't you get records through that or something recordings
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 yeah 
 I think 
 
 yes 
 right 
 So they're actually commissioned performances
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I had heard good things about the Music Heritage Society 
 but if I get involved in one of those things I end up spending all my money on music
 I almost bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago
 Yeah 
 my roommate signed me up 
 He got a bonus record 
 and I got a lot of bills 
 So we have to watch that
 do you play any instrument yourself
