 Capital punishment I guess out in California has had a lot of you know discourse in the paper 
 apparently you know they haven't executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven I believe
 Yeah 
 they 
 Well we lived in Redwood City when we were out there
 and we found that you know it was a very liberal kind of community 
 But I really feel that the law enforcement community you know puts these people behind bars 
 and then these lawyer groups get together 
 and they I think extend beyond the normal appeal process you know and just drag this guy his ultimate demise out for ten or fifteen years 
 and I think that there's something that has to be changed in the system to do that 
 I think capital punishment was probably stringent enough 
 but I think the appeal process is really getting in the way
 do you feel as though there should be more you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by capital punishment
 Uh-huh
 Well the term technicality 
 The law enforcement community you know has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which grievous <> acts are done you know to get somebody into a situation where they're going to be guilty of a crime
 and whether the rights of that individual have been you know impuned 
 or whether you know a policeman has just made a noncritical error though be it not the right way to do it 
 but you know the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a law breaker as being supportive 
 Now I'm at this juncture 
 you know I'm not sure you know what constitutes a technicality 
 You know that's what all these hearings are about 
 and that's what all these you know court cases are about 
 our glorious you know mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of the can 
 and you know he tried to appeal his conviction 
 and you know it didn't work 
 But be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry 
 in the old days you know and say round about times of battle of Hastings you know and the villages if you were a transgressor they either you know drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody 
 and you were his slave 
 And if he didn't like what you did he killed you
 And that's pretty effective
 you know it's not good for civil rights I guess 
 but it's pretty effective in that you know you've got to get along in the community 
 and if you don't you'll perish Either by the hand of your master or by being pushed out in the woods 
 So as man has gotten more complicated so all of the imaginations to you know protect him from being dumped on by civilian authority in criminal actions especially you know murder cases and that sort of thing
 Uh-huh
