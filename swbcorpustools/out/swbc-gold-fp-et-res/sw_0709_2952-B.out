 Well I have two children
 so I do not have a whole lot of spare time right now
 One of the things that I have made time for is playing softball
 I really enjoy 
 I enjoy softball 
 but I enjoy all kind of sports 
 I enjoy watching and participating 
 I really like water sports like swimming and skiing 
 but I do not get to do that too often
 And then I really enjoy sewing 
 but I do not get much of a chance to just really sit down and do much sewing 
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 I know it 
 It is
 Do you work full time
 Part time
 Oh
 Right 
 Yeah 
 that definitely takes over your time
 Is this going to be your first
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 Well that is 
 it sure is fun to do that kind of thing because then you have got something to show for it
 Yeah 
 That is neat
 Yeah 
 I do too
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well since I have had kids it is kind of funny I never really was much of a garage sale shopper until I had kids 
 *[[ 2 slash units ]] But you will probably find after your children get bigger like when they want things like tricycles toys things that cost quite a lot in the store you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars
 And 
 Yeah 
 you can just get all kinds of things and kids especially clothes and toys they just do not use them and wear them you know for that many years or anything
 *[[ 2 slash units ]] So I am 
 I have become a garage sale shopper
 And it is fun
 On the weekends I drive around look to see you know who is selling what 
 And I found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class And just you know all kinds of things like that that you would probably pay thirty dollars for 
 and I got them for two dollars 
 Yeah 
 So 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it is 
 it does take more time 
 But I do not work 
 so that is something I have decided I am going to make sure my kids have a happy growing up years 
 and 
 Yeah
 Well Well that is good
 I am glad
 Well at first when you first have a baby seems to take every moment of your time Partly because you are not used to you know juggling your time around like that 
 But eventually you will be doing lots of stuff 
 So 
 But I think my husband is real into sports too 
 He plays on a T I softball team and the church softball team 
 And by the time he plays two games a week and I play a game a week we go to lots of softball 
 But the kids enjoy going because there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with 
 and that is getting outside and you know doing things they like to do too 
 So 
 Yeah 
 And one other thing we are doing this year is we bought Wet and Wild passes
 We have never done that before 
 but the kids are always wanting to play in the water 
 And like you said unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play it is kind of hard 
 And they have real good kiddie areas at both of the Wet and Wild's around here 
 So we are planning on going two or three times a week 
 Yeah 
 I think it will
 Yeah 
 Because my oldest daughter is in school 
 and she gets bored real fast when she is home with nothing to do
 So I think that will be a lot of fun
 So we are looking forward to that
 Well when I got married I thought it was going to be fun 
 But my husband and I both I think consider it a chore 
 It's 
 our yard has had so many problems 
 It has completely died out two times
 And we have had to start all over trying to plant grass 
 So it has become a chore 
 Do you and your husband like to work in the yard
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 That is true
 Yeah
 Well that is how sewing 
 I love to sew 
 and I wish I had more time to do it 
 But sometimes I will get started on a project and then finishing it is more of a chore than 
 Yeah 
 Another thing I enjoy doing is cooking 
 I like especially 
 it is real strange 
 but I like to cook for other people 
 Like I have a friend that is pregnant 
 but she can't get up and walk around right now
 So I enjoy you know cooking things to take over to her house 
 or 
 Yeah 
 And it is fun for me to do that 
 it is something I enjoy doing 
 It is funny though it is like I do not really want to cook for us 
 It is kind of like when you are a kid and someone else's house was fun to clean 
 but you did not want to do your own 
 Yeah
 yeah
 Yeah 
 When you are home it makes a difference 
 It sure does
 Well do you guys go camping or anything like that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well that is something that we are planning to do not this weekend but the next 
 My parents go camping a lot 
 and they invited the kids and my husband and me to go with them 
 and 
 Yeah 
 We are really looking forward to it 
 The girls love it 
 They have been a couple of times and just getting to be outside you know all the time and sleep in a tent that is really fun to them 
 So We are looking forward to that
 Yeah 
 I think so
 Yeah 
 my husband loves to fish 
 I am not much into fishing 
 but my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish 
 so I think it will be real good for them 
 They can go fishing
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 I know 
 Yeah 
 she is really looking forward 
 I am hoping 
 that is another thing though when sometimes your hobbies can interfere with each other
 Because my husband is afraid he is going to have a softball tournament that weekend
 And I am saying no no 
 Yeah 
 If you are doing a lot of things sometimes you have conflicts 
 and you have to decide what you enjoy the most
 So 
 Well not really right now 
 I keep thinking when the kids get bigger and I have a little more time I would love to cross-stitch 
 I think cross-stitching is so pretty 
 but I have never done any
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I crocheted when I was younger 
 It is funny when I was in high school I made a blanket 
 And 
 but you know I can't even remember how I did it now 
 It has been so long since I did it that 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Yeah 
 well I did the same thing 
 when I was pregnant with my first daughter I was really bored 
 and I bought one of those latch hook rug kits
 It was a real pretty rug 
 And I thought well I could use this as a gift or something you know 
 And it was so 
 it was beautiful 
 but I did not realize how long it took 
 And I got about two-thirds of it done
 and then I just 
 I had the baby 
 And then it was just like I forgot all about it 
 And every once in a while I will be digging through the closet 
 and I will find that thing 
 And I will think maybe I ought to get the rest of that out you know and finish it
 But for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big hobby
 It seemed like people did them a lot
 people do not do that much any more 
 So it was something easy I could do 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 You too
 thank you 
 And thanks for calling
 Bye-bye
