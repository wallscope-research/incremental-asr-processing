 Okay 
 well some of the things I like to do are 
 I like to knit 
 I knit sometimes 
 and I sew
 and I like to sew sometimes for my kids 
 I sew clothes for them every once in a while
 And I make quilts
 After a while cross stitch I th- 
 I don't know 
 I have to put it away 
 and then I have to bring it back
 You know and I don't know why that is 
 I don't know if it's looking at the little things every time
 Yeah 
 that might be it
 That might <> 
 and yet there's 
 do you
 Oh
 I bet
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I've not really done too much challenging stuff 
 I can do it with a needle and thread you know and get about five small stitches in which is pretty good 
 but it's very long
 It's very tedious if you don't have a whole group you're not finishing a quilt in a long time 
 So 
 So I like to just mostly do the tie quilts
 That's so much easier
 But the other ones are very pretty 
 They're 
 we have a quilt on our bed that's 
 instead of like yarn they tied ribbon into it
 And it's real pretty
 It's real pretty
 wow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Now did you say you could knit
 Oh
 Well I was going to say Because if you could knit you could crochet
 It's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to weave the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand
 And then you just use your right hand with the hook
 And that's not 
 it's really not too difficult 
 You could learn that I'm sure and pick that up
 I think if you can do any handicraft you can learn to crochet
 It's not too difficult
 Yeah 
 <> Isn't that interesting
 I think that's really interesting
 Huh 
 And yet you know I think about you know 
 you said you do a lot of needlework 
 and there are some beautiful just gorgeous patterns that people do 
 And I just think that that's one of the arts that I think are really pretty 
 And a lot of people don't do that either
 You know and so 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's true 
 You know and I always think well I can do this and watch T V or something you know 
 And it seems like I always get my mind carried away to something else 
 and then it doesn't quite work 
 or 
 And you know I like to sketch 
 I can sketch something like if I see a picture like out of a book I can sketch that
 and that's nice and everything 
 but you know it's funny 
 I can't draw it out of my own head kind of thing 
 I wish I could 
 and yet I can't do you know like craft on wood
 I can't do that painting thing
 And yet 
 Yeah 
 me too 
 Me too 
 I know a woman who's just wonderful at that
 And I look at it 
 and you know you look at those things 
 and you wish so badly that you could do them 
 I guess if you wanted to you could take classes and learn 
 I guess that's the only way I could do it
