 Okay 
 could you tell me what you think contributes most to air pollution
 well you talked about volcanos 
 I'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now and what the amount of material that they do put into the atmosphere 
 I think probably the greatest cause is vehicles especially around cities 
 do you live right in the city itself
 Okay 
 so Can you notice 
 well it's 
 I live in a rural area
 It's mainly farms and no heavy industry 
 Attleboro itself 
 I live in Rhode Island
 And it's in the north 
 I live up in the northeast corner 
 and Attleboro sits in just over the line where T I's plant is 
 but there isn't a lot of heavy industry 
 There's the freeways 
 and we get an occasional 
 it depends which way the winds blowing from Boston cause we're like forty miles south of Boston 
 so we'll pick up that 
 And I've noticed over the past say maybe five or six years 
 we live about twenty miles away from the state airport 
 and I notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger 
 they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over our homes
 And it seems like we're catching all that residue 
 I'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping 
 But other than that you know we don't have unless we're catching it from the midwest the emissions You know from the power plants 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 we generate 
 one of our biggest electrical plants in Rhode Island uses coal to generate electricity 
 there doesn't seem to be much emission from them 
 but I'm not sure about the rest of the country
 Okay 
 well is that right 
 Yeah 
 surprise surprise
 Yeah 
 there must be some of the larger plants up around one hundred twenty-eight
 we've got reports that 
 during the night seems like they'd blow off their stacks from the warehouses for powerhouses
 and they do that at night too because employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted and you know spots all over them
 So you're right 
 they could do something about that I guess
 How are your lakes 
 and 
 They have
 Acid rain 
 yeah 
 that's what I was 
 Yeah 
 no 
 Didn't they just have an article on 
 they were dumping lime
 upstate New York somewhere over huge areas
 and they thought that was more beneficial because you know some of it does soak in 
 and some of it runs off right away in to the streams and rivers 
 and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback
 I can't remember where 
 I read that recently somewhere 
 and I can't remember where
 But I thought it was up there 
 So that's interesting because New Hampshire and parts of Vermont they showed pictures of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain
 you kind of think it's something else then
 they didn't say what though 
 they just said they thought it was 
 natural disease
 Yeah 
 yeah
 we can demand more efficient automobiles for one thing 
 I still think that's one of our major causes of pollutants
 how we go about that it's a little bit difficult
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think you need a vehicle something like Ralph Nader Nader's Raiders or A A R P which has a lot of members if you can get those types of groups
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 they're better 
 but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there 
 when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch smoke or 
 I'm not really sure 
 You think that the trucking industry is that incompetent that they wouldn't you know 
 fuel is one of their biggest costs
 So you would 
 Yeah 
 diesel engines
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 We could also push for legislation for rapid transit systems 
 This country seems to be a little behind on that
 yeah 
 but only because we got used to single person single car driving 
 A lot of people don't even like to carpool
 But we could that 
 That'll help air pollution 
 The United States and Canada is going into some types of agreements to limit what's being given out by power plants
 I guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there
 So that's helping
 Now that's an idea 
 don't say that too loud though because every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating revenue 
 that's an interesting concept 
 Is that your idea
 Well I was going to say 
 right 
 it could be installed like a catalytic converter
 I guess you could take those off too 
 but 
 Yeah 
 if you can take a muffler off and only replace 
 well not unless it was built into every muffler
 And that's 
 that's quite a concept 
 You should pursue that I think or patent it you know
 If you could come up with a device that's the thing
 But it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that 
 But that's a thought 
 No
 you're right 
 and that will solve a lot of problems 
 I don't know if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that
 but you know a proposal to I guess the proper authorities 
 well you might generate some 
 yeah 
 you might generate some interest in it 
 But that's a good idea 
 Other than that I'm not sure what individuals can do other than like I said get involved through a group or an organization
