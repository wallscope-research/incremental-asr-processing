 Yeah 
 I like to 
 I don't have a boat 
 but I like to fish 
 and there's a lot of lakes around here 
 are there many lakes up there
 Uh-huh
 They have mostly small mouth in them 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 that's right 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 it's 
 I fish for bass 
 but I hardly ever catch one 
 but they have a tail race over in Lake Lavon
 and you know when they open up the dam and let out water they wash down the fish 
 and you catch that white bass and crappie out of there
 Every once in a while there'll be striped bass
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 what do you catch perch on
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's 
 sometimes I use corn 
 but some fish steal it off the hook sometimes
 Yeah 
 the other day I was fishing with bread 
 there's a college across the street
 and they 
 it's full of carp and I caught a carp on a about what size is that I think it was a number two treble hook
 and it's huge 
 its mouth was full of hooks
 So he was in a bad way 
 But it's 
 he was fast 
 He 
 Yeah 
 Well it's it was sixteen inches long
 Yeah 
 I think it was about a pound and a half you know 
 but all they're good for is the fight 
 Boy they really don't want to come out of the water 
 they zip through the water you know 
 how your line goes you know 
 and I thought you know that I wasn't going to be able to get it in because the one I hooked just about ten minutes before when I tried to raise it out of the water it fell off 
 so it wasn't hooked very well 
 But you know I got it that far 
 I figured that 
 Yeah 
 that's what I said 
 That's what I told the guy 
 The guy was standing there 
 and he laughed when it fell off 
 and I said that's a quick release right there
 catfish yeah 
 But I haven't eaten anything else you know 
 there's some 
 my dad has a farm 
 and there's 
 he has two ponds up there 
 and my uncle has a pond upstream 
 and there's a lot of crappie in there now 
 But I think he's the only one that's that's caught a big enough crappie to eat 
 But the catfish you know there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and that 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 and if you know 
 when you have to look in their eyes and you know hit them in the head or whatever that's what you do with a catfish you know because you have to sever their spinal cord
 Yeah 
 yeah
 not yet 
 My brother went off the coast of Maine 
 when the 
 I don't know 
 what they 
 mackerel 
 that school up there 
 *[[listen--is there overlap]] It's 
 he said that it was just like that 
 They were throwing like hell benders or some other kind of treble hook lure 
 and each time they bring them in they'd have at least one 
 sometimes they've had you know one on every hook
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Wow
 Yeah 
 down here it's like two hundred dollars a day
 A group party
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well I don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not
 Yeah 
 It's nice talking to you
 Good luck
 Bye-bye
