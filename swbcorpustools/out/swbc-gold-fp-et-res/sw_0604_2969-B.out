 Yes
 well
 Well the topic today was gardening and lawn care 
 Ooh
 Yeah
 You know what 
 It seems like we are doing it here forever 
 We bought a large house that was completely unlandscaped 
 it probably was up to your shoulder in thistles 
 That was all that was there
 And we hired a professional landscaper to do it 
 And I have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted 
 or the plants do not make the winter time
 And so I am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year probably through the Fall too And rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires more care than I am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies
 Just two
 but they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more
 Four and five
 Uh-huh
 well I have a twenty six year old stepson
 and I do not know if that counts
 Well I did for many years 
 So 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It is over with
 back to gardening 
 Are you one of these Howard Garrett organic enthusiasts or a Neil Sperry nuke the lawn with chemicals
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 All right 
 now are you sure they are hyacinths 
 Because that is a bulb
 Well you should of just ripped the whole thing out
 Have you had 
 is this the first year they have been up
 Well let me tell you they do not come back very well at all 
 Maybe they will up further north 
 But down 
 and you are not that much further north 
 I have probably planted around here maybe six hundred bulbs
 No 
 I have done hyacinths 
 But I have just learned from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming Because they do not take the heat here 
 And if they do come back next year they are going to look real puny
 Yep
 About the only bulb that repeats well in my area is the daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb
 They call them flags
 when does it bloom
 And what color
 And you only get one of them
 You know what I bet you they are 
 And I am a pretty good gardener 
 because I have killed a lot of things here 
 and I have planted a lot of them 
 and I work on a landscape committee for our neighborhood
 And our neighborhood is a planned development with I think it is seven hundred and fifty-five families
 But we have about sixty acres that we have to plant 
 I am going to bet you that is a lily Because it is 
 And I will get 
 is it 
 what color is yours blooming
 And what does the foliage look like 
 Does it fit that 
 
 
 I bet you what those things are is a Dutch iris
 I bet you it is a Dutch iris
 on the flower does it have a beard on it at all Any kind of fuzzies
 I am going to bet you that 
 that has got to be blooming this time of year 
 It has 
 Well I was just going to correct myself 
 Because they would have bloomed pretty early
 Well 
 Yeah 
 Right about after the daffodils
 Okay 
 I will bet you those are Dutch iris
 Uh-huh
 Well 
 Yep
 Well <> 
 
 Well then it is not a Dutch iris then 
 gosh
 
 Well I am not so sure that Texans know what they have got
 Did you just move down here
 who 
 Because I have probably got I do not know how many square feet it is a big circular driveway 
 The whole perimeter bordering the house is all in Texas wildflower beds 
 And I am into that 
 and it looks quite formal 
 it really does 
 it looks quite formal 
 But it has been about three or four years of playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here
 You want blue
 Uh-huh
 blue is hard you know 
 Do you want a perennial flower that will bloom all Summer
 Okay 
 Put in a perennial blue salvia 
 Now the plant itself will grow about eighteen inches tall
 And it will send out a flower spike 
 You will see them blooming now 
 It is a wildflower here 
 but you can get them in the nursery
 Yep 
 Well the you know nursery men will sell you things here 
 And they are kind of in a labor of love 
 The other thing to do if you really like the hyacinths and I do is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them
 Yep
 Huh-uh
 Uh-huh
 Salvia
 Uh-huh 
 And now that will bloom all Summer long 
 but it insists on full sun
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I will tell you another plant that is purply 
 it is kind of a purply blue red
 It is really a pretty plant 
 It is sold down here as Purple Buddy
 Now it's not 
 yeah 
 it is not a perennial 
 it is an annual 
 But it will take the heat down here
 Purple Buddy 
 Its proper name is Gomphrena
 G o m p h r e n a 
 Gomphrena 
 And is sold as Purple Buddy or sometimes sold as straw flower 
 And they make about a foot high plant 
 And they send out this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it 
 But that purple ball
