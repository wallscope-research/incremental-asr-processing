 So Beverly what do you think about drug testing
 Yeah 
 we got a lot of mistakes here in the Maryland Baltimore area because of train conductors on drugs 
 I think we've had two terrible accidents here recently 
 and also on just like I bet you within five days a dump truck where the driver was high on marijuana 
 I guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay
 and it would 
 that tied up traffic for a long time 
 everybody died 
 the fire was terrible 
 it was awful 
 So yeah 
 I think you're right 
 I I think if you're in a field 
 but then you know who would test all truck drivers you know
 Right 
 yeah
 I think looking at athletes being drug tested 
 I don't know 
 I think the random drug testing I don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs because they're still being caught
 that make sense
 Yeah 
 and then I think 
 Yeah
 in the long run I think it would be good
 I think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know the test hasn't come down hard on anyone
 I don't know
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Get rid of him
 Right 
 yeah 
 B- 
 Yeah
 Right 
 I think that that's a terrible thi- you know 
 it's really funny though 
 I guess my dad was hit by a drunk driver who was also high when I was probably eighteen my senior year in high school
 and though he's alive today and everything worked out fine it happened about two blocks from the high school 
 and a friend came and got me 
 and I was there 
 and I could smell the dope 
 and I could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him
 and nothing ever happened 
 and from that point on I became so anti drunk driving now I think people should be allowed to drink I think that's an adult responsibility whatever 
 but I really 
 I'm so anti drunk driving 
 and drugs have long lasting effects
 and I guess when I younger I was probably a little more liberal on the subject
 Yeah 
 but as soon as that happened 
 I guess when I was eighteen years old if you'd have asked me I'd have thought it was fine
 but by the time I was nineteen my opinion had totally changed
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Traction and all that terrible stuff
 Right
 Right 
 yeah 
 I don't think somebody 
 Yeah 
 you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life
 you know I wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life 
 You don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
