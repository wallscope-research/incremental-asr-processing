 well that's interesting isn't it 
 yeah
 Right
 What did you think about that idea
 They've not really given it attention either 
 yeah
 Right
 Well I'm glad I'm not the one that's in charge of making those decisions 
 you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're all so serious you know 
 it's not so serious I guess until it affects your family 
 and then all of a sudden it's the most important thing
 So I would hate to have that responsibility just personally 
 but then again we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address 
 I guess it frightens me to think of so many people with AIDS and with cancer 
 and many of those things if they're not able to be insured then the country's going to pay for it one way or the other Whether it's through prevention or treatment or you know <> just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves 
 It seems like one way or the other we're going to end up paying for it
 But <> 
 Just change our p- 
 Right 
 just change our priorities a little bit
 Right
