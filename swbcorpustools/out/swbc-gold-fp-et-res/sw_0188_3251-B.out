 Okay 
 I missed a part of it 
 We're to talk about what lawns and gardens
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I well 
 it's very strange that I got this call because my wife just called me 
 I was just in the shower after finishing you know mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden 
 this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall bulbs
 
 Well that's the way this was 
 the petunias were really great 
 Our mums are beautiful
 I don't think we've had a frost up here 
 I was down in for a week 
 so I don't know what happened last week
 but I don't know if it's late 
 I'm sort of waiting for Indian Summer 
 so I can get a lot of stuff down out here
 I enjoy it 
 well we moved in November and put all the landscaping in this year 
 We came from nine years in a condo 
 and working in that condo you didn't have to do anything you know unless you really wanted to 
 so 
 Right 
 You know I can't 
 this is my third house I think I've owned 
 but it's interesting you know 
 the only problem is that I do quite a bit of traveling 
 and it sort of gets away from me if you're not with it 
 but I enjoy most of it 
 and about this time of year it starts getting a little old 
 and I start looking forward to you know having other things to do with my 
 Well it is for me 
 because I've been doing a lot of fertilizing 
 We had a terrible summer 
 we had a drought
 and took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing 
 and now it's really growing 
 and I'm trying to establish a good root growth you know for the winter
 Really
 
 really
 
 yeah
 yeah 
 I hear that from my brother-in-law lives in Plano
 Yeah 
 Well he always 
 he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here 
 and then he calls us
 yeah 
 it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine 
 So 
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that is 
 you know I was like conditioned to it
 they have to be hardened to it 
 that's strange with me 
 You know you think Dallas you know almost semitropical you wouldn't have that kind of problem 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Really 
 do they
 Uh-huh
 I love 
 Yeah 
 I love the landscaping 
 like I say my brother-in-law I get to Carrollton quite a bit
 I go there on business 
 and I really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens 
 and Texas is 
 Dallas is very nice 
 I really enjoy it there The landscaping the homes the architecture the whole thing very enjoyable gardens 
 and my wife and I 
 Well 
 Yeah 
 that we have you know 
 Ohio's a very pretty state 
 in seventy-six we moved to Chicago 
 we lived there for five years 
 and I remember the first time I took my wife there on a house hunt 
 we were coming in 
 and before the plane landed she looked out the window 
 and she said there's no trees down there
 this is Illinois 
 you're not 
 And when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land
 and now all of a sudden it was being developed 
 and the first thing I did was planted all kinds of trees
