 Okay
 I guess the first thing has been for the right for women to vote 
 I think that has been a major change and also the fact that there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were 
 and that's probably going to increase You know
 I'm sorry
 It sure does 
 Yeah 
 there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays
 Role
 Right
 That's changing 
 Right
 Right 
 yeah 
 I agree 
 It definitely has changed
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well you know they've been talking about 
 and I don't know what the status is on it 
 but you know women get maternity leave and stuff like that 
 and I know that there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out 
 but you know I haven't really heard much about that recently
 Uh-huh
 is that right
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 that's interesting
 That's a bummer though 
 You got to take the time off 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies run by females
 And we'll prob- 
 I'm sorry
 Right 
 right 
 upper management 
 more women in upper management 
 and probably we'll see more females in political roles 
 More governors and I think you know roles like that
 Well in Texas we have a female governor
 And we had a female mayor here in Dallas 
 and her term just ended 
 so I think we're probably going to see more of that in the future <> 
 Uh-huh
 Right you know 
 and that's fine with me
 but sometimes 
 I'm not a women's libber by any means 
 but I do 
 there are issues that you know as far as like equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff I totally am for
 But I don't get into the real women libber movement you know
 Yeah
 Right 
 right
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 I've heard of that 
 I haven't really talked to anybody that's you know too involved with that 
 But I think that is a 
 Like the cottage industry 
 is that what you're talking about women working out of their homes
 Yeah 
 I think it's wonderful 
 Yeah
 I kn- 
 By the phone and all that
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up 
 Right
 Right
