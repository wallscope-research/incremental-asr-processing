 That's good
 That's good 
 it's hard for me to find time also to read 
 a lot of times I do just read magazines and stuff like that you know because I don't have a lot of time 
 but when I do get to sit down and read I like to read the Bible 
 and I like to read 
 I read to my daughter a lot too
 And I like to read you know Bi- 
 I have Bible storybooks
 so I like reading those to her 
 and she really enjoys those 
 So that's good 
 and it's kind of short because we don't have a lot of time to read

 Well I have a 
 my daughter has PRECIOUS MOMENTS collection
 and I like that because it's real easy to follow for her 
 you know gosh if I read straight out of the Bible to her she'd never understand any of it
 That's right 
 it is real hard to follow and understand
 and I've got a Bible that has a little bit of a glossary in the back 
 and it helps explain who people are 
 that's about the hardest thing is who's related to who 
 Yeah
 Yes

 Yeah 
 that is 
 he just brings stuff alive you know
 You could just visualize everything
 That's 
 Yeah 
 I think they did a pretty good job 
 but they didn't follow it exactly 
 but they did you know do it justice
 But most of the time they don't follow books very well when they make them into movies
