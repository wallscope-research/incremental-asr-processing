 Okay 
 I'm presently living in a house 
 first time 
 we had the house built 
 and so this is our fifth year in it I guess 
 and it was a real excitement to go out and select the house and have one made and built 
 and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses 
 And as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in Dallas-Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home 
 and they're good for about five years or four years 
 and after that they start falling apart 
 So I would not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in because they're overpriced 
 but they're a cheap house 
 If you can't afford something good you know 
 they're good for that 
 and you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head 
 but as far as the costs for what your getting the longevity of the house is not worth it 
 How about in your case
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's great 
 that's great 
 that's 
 I've heard 
 I have another gentleman friend of mine who had a house built 
 as a matter of fact another guy is building one now 
 he's been doing it for three years 
 and the city's a little upset with him 
 but I understand you save a lot of money off by doing that 
 and 
 Nothing wrong with that
 I'll vouch for that 
 
 That was a big savings
 Well that's great 
 have you been in it long
 really 
 well have you any plans to maybe expand or move onward
 I see 
 well 
 First one is always a bear
 We're having an architect friend of mine design a house for us 
 and that can basically be put in any state you know 
 so that's kind of we just got with him and told him what all we wanted
 and he's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it 
 and he's certified and registered 
 so least we know it's not going to fall in or something if it's built
 But I have heard that your approach is right 
 you can actually go out and sub it even if you don't want to get hands on
 you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things 
 and that's kind of the plan I have 
 so I'm 
 everyone I talk to I file in my little book and do other things with it 
 That's great 
 that's great
 Sure 
 I can imagine
 If your happy with it that's all that counts
 That's all 
 you only have to satisfy yourself and no one else
 that's an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell I guess
 Well that's great 
 Well yeah 
 I guess that about does it
 Nice talking with you too
 Bye
