 Golfer
 Well 
 Well that's about the way I am 
 I don't consider myself a good one 
 but I do enjoy it
 I usually play a couple of times a month 
 Sometimes more 
 but lately it's been just about that 
 But I do enjoy 
 I think one of the things I enjoy the most is the beauty of the golf courses
 Uh-huh 
 You can get out there
 Yeah 
 that's really neat 
 You can just get out there and lose yourself in it and forget everything else in the world except what you're seeing out there
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 it really is
 And you know it's so frustrating 
 I keep wondering sometimes why do I do this because it's so frustrating 
 You think you do pretty good one day 
 and you're doing a whole lot better you know 
 and then all of a sudden you go back out 
 and it's just terrible
 You can't do anything right 
 Boy I'm improving Uh-huh 
 And you think my goodness why did I think I was doing better 
 I don't 
 I guess I could 
 I've never been to a major golf tournament
 I watch them on T V a lot
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Uh-huh
 I'll bet 
 Uh-huh
 Well I've only been playing like about three years now 
 My husband's played for twenty-five 
 But I just took it up about three years ago 
 and we play in a lot of couple's scramble tournaments 
 We belong to a country club a little ways outside of Dallas 
 and we have developed a tremendous number of friends that couples do this 
 and you know it's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses
 You can meet some really neat people
 Uh-huh 
 they really are 
 I just love them
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 And you just do your own thing and be relaxed and enjoy it 
 Really
 Really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I have never played in any tournament except just a scramble 
 They have a lot of them there at the club you know 
 they have A B C D type tournaments 
 and then they have the club championships and everything with the women's slots as well 
 but I don't know 
 I've just never really gotten into that 
 Now my husband and all the men they love the real competitiveness of playing for money you know
 Uh-huh 
 But I'm not good enough for that 
 Yes 
 they do 
 I don't do much with it since most of theirs 
 they have a traveling league 
 and most of their meetings and all are during the week 
 and I don't get to play except on the weekend 
 I work during the week all the time
 Uh-huh 
 Someday when I get where I live closer to the club and partially retired maybe I'll be able to play a little more 
 but 
 Uh-huh
