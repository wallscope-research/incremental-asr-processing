 Okay
 what's your most recent one that you've seen
 Uh-huh 
 Really 
 I used to do that too 
 but I haven't been doing it lately 
 but 
 No 
 see I haven't seen that one 
 No 
 is it good
 no 
 not ye- 
 I know that sounds funny coming from a woman 
 but usually I don't 
 action 
 I guess well two of my favorite movies is probably like LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON TWO
 And those are like two of my most favorite 
 they're just really good movies 
 And I liked BIRD ON A WIRE And movies like that
 yeah 
 some I guess like 
 what do you mean 
 like are you talking about movies like DIE HARD TWO 
 Okay 
 yeah 
 I liked that 
 that was pretty good
 that was okay 
 I guess I thought it was too far fetched 
 but so many people said no it wasn't you know 
 But I guess 
 Really 
 that's true because 
 I don't know 
 I just didn't find that one to be real 
 I just thought it was too far fetched
 <> gosh I can't think off my head 
 Do you know which one yours was
 yeah 
 well that's 
 Right 
 Really 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 you're right about that 
 but that's really like an all time classic 
 I don't think [ anybody anything ] could ever beat that
 See I've never seen that
 No 
 should I rent it
 Should I go rent it tomorrow 
 That's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking history in school 
 So it'd probably be a good thing for me to see Oh
 really
 Uh-huh 
 Really
 you just gave it away 
 I guess I can't go see it 
 no
 That does sound good 
 is it one 
 I guess it's a rental
 Okay 
 I may have to do that Go see it 
 or go rent it
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 it's not David is it
 I don't watch that 
 
 Really 
 
 see that's one side of the action I guess that I didn't really care for 
 but see I don't really like Sylvester Stallone
 I don't think he's really a very good actor 
 I know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful 
 but I just have never been a Stallone fan
 Hey that's pretty good
 No 
 I guess like I say 
 I don't know I just have never seen any interest in him 
 but 
 Oh
 Yeah 
 I don't either 
 Yeah 
 you're right 
 Well it's so 
 I guess I'm a realist and so when I watch movies like that it's like this can not happen 
 So I just don't enjoy it you know because it's just like come on give me a break
 You know I just 
 and so many of them are done so poorly
 you know it just doesn't even give you the effect 
 some of them are done good 
 and they do scare you 
 But so many of them are just done real 
 I don't know 
 I'm not really into those
 that was one of my favorites 
 yes
 I thought that was a very good movie
 I was really impressed with that one 
 what I liked about it was that it was a new subject 
 Nobody had ever touched it before
 You know and it was done so well you know 
 it was just 
 Right 
 well that's probably true 
 But it was a very good movie 
 It was done real well too 
 there wasn't any part of it that you really felt like no this can't happen 
 it seemed real 
 you know it was really good
 that was one 
 it's not my all time favorite movie 
 but it was good 
 it was really good
 And I don't know if you like this kind 
 but I thought PRETTY WOMAN was a really good movie too
 Yeah 
 we've seen that two or three times 
 We waited 
 and we rented it
 you know but it was really good
 No 
 I haven't 
 I don't know if I've even heard of that one
 It must have what's his name in it
 No 
 it doesn't
 Really
 Yeah 
 Paul Hogan
 No 
 really 
 I'm surprised 
 really that must be pretty good then 
 was it good
 Oh 
 Yes 
 yes
 Yeah 
 it was 
 TWINS was good too 
 because when I thought of that I thought of 
 anyway 
 there was another one 
 what's the one that just 
 DANCES WITH WOLVES have you seen that yet
 you've got to see that one 
 it's really 
 Right 
 that's probably true 
 that's probably true 
 it's very very good Very good
 That's another one that 
 I was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it
 Really
 wow that's impressive
 neat 
 yeah 
 it's really worth it 
 it's a very good movie 
 and yes 
 I would suggest seeing it at the theater 
 I know that they're still playing it 
 and they pushed it back to playing it in the theaters until like August
 I think because they were scheduling a video release of it in July 
 and then when it won all those awards they pushed it back to August 
 <> so But yeah 
 that one is definitely worth seeing 
 it's really good
 Yeah 
 and you know I didn't think that one was near as good
 You know I guess it was okay 
 it was all right 
 but when I compare like the winners of this year and last year it just 
 I don't know 
 Maybe it's not
