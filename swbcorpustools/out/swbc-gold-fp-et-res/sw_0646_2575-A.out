 Well what's your views on it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Sure
 Sure
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 we're not too far behind 
 I graduated in seventy-one 
 so I'm same generation 
 I'm 
 it's going to be a short conversation because I agree with you
 I think I don't even think it ought to be voluntary 
 I think it ought to be mandatory for kids to either do military service or public service one of the two 
 a lot of reasons for that not just because I'm a hard ass or anything
 It's just that like you say kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do 
 and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus 
 And I think that it might stop us some problems later on 
 you know these kids will get their heads on straight and figure out what they want to do instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something 
 I think it would be good for them 
 it helps mature them a little bit and helps them understand the world the way it really is
 yeah
 yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 and most of them aren't
 you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right even in high school 
 and you know you wonder where are the parents in all of this 
 You know why isn't somebody stepping in and putting a stop to this 
 Kids in high school are just too young to be married
 they have no idea what the world is like 
 They don't how tough it is out there to make a living
 I was in the same boat when I left high school 
 my parents wanted me to go straight to college 
 and I didn't 
 You know I was ready 
 I was ready 
 I had wanderlust 
 I wanted to get out and see some things 
 So I joined the Air Force and ended up staying there for thirteen years
 but I had lived in my own little bubble up until that time 
 and after traveling around the world a few times I realized that things ain't the way they seem
 And I did a lot of growing up there 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 That's right 
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Well you know it's just like you say there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country 
 and you know if you could have a thought of something like a Peace Corps sort of organization this would be so useful for instance just helping old folks
 you know they need help 
 they don't have anybody to depend on 
 and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house or do minor repairs or something like that 
 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 my mom's in the same position late sixties 
 and it got to the point where me and my brother both were gone and she couldn't maintain the house without large expenditures of money
 You know it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment 
 And I'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway 
 but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things You know like the yard work and little repairs and painting and stuff like that
 Oh yeah 
 sure
 Sure 
 the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money
 You know that 
 I remember when I was a kid I used to do little things for the old folks around the neighborhood 
 and I know how it made me feel 
 <> You know you s- 
 people just don't help people anymore 
 they're out for themselves 
 and 
 Yeah 
 well that's the point we've gotten to you know 
 Every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government 
 And the government's going to be limited 
 where are they going to get the money 
 They're going to get it from us 
 And we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government
 We don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program
 the thing that Carter works on Habitats For Humanity I was involved in that in Montgomery before I came up to North Carolina
 and it was a pretty neat little program 
 We'd just go out 
 and they would buy a plot of land and contractors and builders 
 and everybody else would donate their time 
 and the materials were at cost 
 And we'd put up houses 
 And that was kind of neat 
 in a way I think it's a little bit inefficient 
 but it's better than nothing
 and at least I had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing 
 course on the other hand I can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves but just won't Because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw welfare money than it is to work 
 we did a cost comparison in one of my courses 
 and we took all the benefits that a married couple with two kids would get under welfare and what they would be making at minimum wage 
 And they came out four thousand dollars better a year by taking welfare
 So there's no incentive for them to do anything 
 <> Far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money
 You had to do something
 Yeah 
 and that was tried in Alabama too 
 and it got shot down
 and I don't understand the reasoning for it 
 I really don't 
 it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money then they should return something to the public 
 if nothing else go out along an interstate and pick up garbage
 Yeah 
 what do they do in Maryland 
 do they use highway people 
 or do they use prisoners
 Yeah 
 that's the way they did it in Alabama too
 usually you'd see these big chain gangs out there picking up trash
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 we have that here in North Carolina
