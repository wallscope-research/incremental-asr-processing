 Do you have any
 Uh-huh
 All right
 Yeah
 that's good 
 You don't often find that 
 I don't think
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Sure 
 There's a 
 okay 
 that's interesting 
 Yeah 
 the only pet that I've had 
 I'm a doctoral student right now
 and in my earlier days as a student I kind of time shared on a dog with a good friend of mine 
 and it was an amazing dog 
 it really was 
 he had gotten it from the pound 
 and it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino Kind of looks like a Dalmatian 
 and we trained it from a pup 
 and basically right now it's fully trained 
 and it can do a lot of things 
 It will get beer for you out of the fridge 
 and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff 
 So it's kind of a show piece 
 and whenever anybody comes over we all have to show him Domino you know 
 Yeah 
 it's 
 she's been a real good dog 
 and just it's kind of a shame that I'm away from it now 
 I actually live in Florida
 but I'm on an internship up here for a year 
 and then I go back down 
 but 
 yeah 
 Domino's a real good dog
 what possessed you to get the dog
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Sure learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that
 That's good 
 That kind of builds some character a little bit
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's something that's important for sure
 I think do you live in a fairly rural part of the 
 or 
 I see
 
 Yeah
 it's not that big of a problem 
 With Domino she was full grown 
 I would estimate seventy pounds
 And you know we lived in Oviedo which is a small town 
 it's a suburb of Orlando
 but there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around 
 and she was a dog that loved to run 
 so that was the biggest problem I saw 
 and I think that's one of the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is you know do you have the room for this dog to run around 
 or you know I guess you can't really say for cats 
 Me and cats don't get along too well 
 but you know that whole space issue I think is real important
 Right
 Yeah 
 that 
 Sure 
 and that's all part of keeping your part of the relationship You know showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those issues
 You know and also the whole thing with noise 
 My mother she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs that don't train them
 and you know we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had Brittany Spaniels 
 and they're very high strung animals to begin with 
 but
