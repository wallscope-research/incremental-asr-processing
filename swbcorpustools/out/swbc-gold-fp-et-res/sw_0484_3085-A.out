 Okay
 Uh-huh
 great
 Great 
 well my children are grown 
 but they're teenagers
 so I have three children ages fifteen seventeen and twenty
 and I guess about when the youngest one was in kindergarten I started working at a preschool and you know doing some work 
 and then I took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool 
 so I am around not a day care situation but you know in the child care environment
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 it is
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 in other words there're more people 
 Yes 
 yes 
 that's an interesting point of view 
 I you know 
 seeing the children in the school the way I do we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds as opposed to the ones that have been in the program that started at twelve months maybe and were even in there one day a week which is all our school provides you know for the under three year olds
 but still they have an opportunity to be with other children
 and it is true 
 but as far as looking for a place you know I think it's very important to have very caring people you know to take care of the 
 in a school if you're going to have the structure and you're going to have the large numbers you're going to need really 
 Yes 
 yes
 Yes 
 it is
 Yes 
 that's right 
 that maybe 
 Yeah 
 that maybe have another salary in their family where they can do that 
 and that's what I had the opportunity of you know doing
 and I could concentrate on the creativity and you know really having a lot of fun with the children and providing them with a great atmosphere 
 Yeah
 And they have to be there at sometimes six o'clock in the morning
 which is 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yes 
 that's true 
 that's true
 Yeah 
 yeah
 because people can't pay to provide and 
 well you know ours is a church 
 and so we don't have the expenses of a building you know
 we share the expense with the church 
 but we don't have enough
 you know taking care of a whole building and that responsibility 
 So it is a lot different
 my goodness
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 you did
 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 yes
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well that's different than most people do it 
 a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school you know
 But 
 Yeah
 Yes 
 that's true
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 dear
 dear
 how awful
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 yes
 
 gosh
 dear
 Yes
 good
 Yes
