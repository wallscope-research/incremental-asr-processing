 Well as far as T I is concerned I'm not sure 
 and I have heard you know in residential situations 
 I live in a dorm

 and the only responsibility of the patron is to separate them 
 and then the 
 I guess the department takes them and does what they do with them 
 and it doesn't cost the patron anything 
 Doesn't really cost the department
 Right 
 they don't pay for the recycled items
 Uh-huh
