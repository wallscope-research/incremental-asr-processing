 There we go
 Well actually I'm a Dodgers fan from way back
 
 Like late fifties early sixties
 What's that
 Yeah
 Is that right
 That's interesting 
 Yeah 
 I also lived eight years in Ohio before going away to college 
 and I used to go watch the Toledo Mudhens
 I couldn't tell you for sure 
 It's been a long time
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think that's right
 Well that's true 
 I think I've kind of become a Rangers fan over the last eleven years since I've been here 
 they've led the American league in batting fielding and pitching 
 but they've never been able to do more than one of those in any given year 
 So 
 I don't either 
 the guy's twenty twenty-five home rums maybe thirty eighty some R B I-s
 he really has become a very decent fielder
 He's not the liability that he used to be
 
 Yeah 
 of course get a guy like Cecil Fielder you know 
 if he strikes out a lot so what
 yeah
 Right
 Yep
 Well I think the key for L A this year is whether Oral Herschiser can come back
 It may be
 Right 
 right
 Well picking up Darrell Strawberry didn't hurt
 who's the last one
 okay
 Yes he is
 Yes
 Yeah
 Well it should be an interesting year
 Are you an Orioles fan
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you know I kind of wish that they had inter league play like they do in all the other sports so I could see some of the National League teams here once in a while
 three hundred miles
 Yeah 
 it's incredible
 There you go
 Boy you are a baseball fan aren't you
 Interesting
 Wow
 All right
 so do it while you can
 Sure 
 Well it's been good talking with you
 I wouldn't mind it
 Yeah 
 well God bless 
 and good talking with you
 Bye-bye
