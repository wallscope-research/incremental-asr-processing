 How do you usually keep up with current events
 Do you 
 Yeah 
 I don't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday 
 so I try to listen to the radio in the morning and try to catch one of the morning talk shows 
 and then I usually end up flipping through C N N and HEADLINE NEWS during the evening 
 I always try to read the Sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the week's hot events 
 So I try to catch that if nothing else
 for local news I think we do real well where it's 
 we live in a kind of small town 
 but I think we get excellent local coverage 
 and I like the national news that we see 
 we watch N B C 
 and I think they do a real good job 
 So I've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get 
 how about you
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 but I think there's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us 
 and like you said save the commentaries because I'm going to listen to the news and draw my own opinions 
 I don't really need their help to do that
 I don't think radio is as bad to do that as T V is
 Uh-huh
 Right
 I used to 
 but I don't anymore maybe once or twice a year
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Yes
 Yeah 
 Well I had heard a couple of people you know that I had talked to about certain programs say that you know they had read other things besides what SIXTY MINUTES presented and that they didn't present it nearly the same way as the you know news articles or whatever they had already been familiar with 
 So I started questioning just how bias they really were 
 so 
 <> 
 No 
 not really you know 
 in the last few years just his kind of informal segments I've seen 
 but I never got to see his actual nightly news 
 I liked 
 I did grow up with David Brinkley 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 we used to watch him and I guess John Chancellor 
 And I always liked David Brinkley 
 and I used to enjoy John Chancellor's style of reporting 
 but on the nightly news now he goes into his commentary 
 and that's where I get into the problem with him 
 I frequently disagree with his commentaries 
 so 
 Right 
 What did you think of the news coverage of the war
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Did that help you understand a lot what was going on your prior experience with the military did
 I wondered if it would help you sometimes fill-in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that people like myself might not pick up on
 Okay 
 What weekly magazine do you look at 
 is it 
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Does that give a pretty good overview of everything 
 or like does it give I guess little encapsulated reports and then a few big stories
 Yeah
 That sounds good if you were short on time you could get a summary real quick
 Right
 Right
 Well we're working on a NEWSWEEK 
 for the last couple of months we got you know an introductory subscription 
 so we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like GLAMOUR or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED 
 So we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us so to speak
 It can't hurt 
 No 
 I enjoy reading T NEWS 
 I try to catch it because it's another example 
 they just show you the words and the facts 
 and they don't offer any commentary 
 and it gives me a quick chance to be caught up during the day Because you know we don't listen to the radio at work at all 
 So I don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything
 Yeah 
 and the other thing we have that I like to check sometimes is TALKING FINGERS 
 do you have that
 You have different telephone numbers that you can dial 
 and then you dial in an access code 
 and depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update it will give you updated information 
 So that can give you you know current news updates current weather updates things like that 
 and it's offered through the local phone company free of charge 
 So that's an interesting alternative occasionally that I like to use
 it really is nice because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk and find out about 
 So that is something you might keep your eyes open for 
 I think it's catching on throughout the country
