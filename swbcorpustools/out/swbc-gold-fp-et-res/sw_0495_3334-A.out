 Well what do you know about Latin American policies
 Uh-huh
 Are you relating this to the affair we've got going on in Haiti right now
 Right
 that's just it
 Right 
 I guess my concern you know no matter which side we take we're going to have supporters and we're going to have antisupporters I guess for lack of better term 
 and like you said they're such small countries that we're bound to upset somebody 
 but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance
 Right
 Right
 That's true
 Sure
 Yep 
 that's about the lump sum of it 
 Well I was speaking with a woman 
 I believe she was from the Honduras or Guatemala or somewhere in there 
 no 
 she was from El Salvador
 and she was from a relatively wealthy family 
 and when the Contras came into power of course with 
 gosh darn what's his face 
 he's in Florida jail now 
 Marcos 
 no 
 Marcos is Philippines
 Well you know who I'm talking about
 Yeah 
 I know it 
 anyway when he came into power he basically just took everybody's property you know just assigned it to himself
 Right
 right 
 so she's been a real strong supporter of the Sandinistas and has been trying to back the U S government in that respect 
 and in that respect I have to agree that I think we're taking the right stance because they were a democracy turned 
 yeah 
 right
 basically a dictator fascist 
 Sure
 Well what do you think of this U S free trade agreement we're working on with Mexico
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Mexico 
 the Mexican government is trying 
 and a lot of the larger Mexican businesses are trying to make themselves Americanized I guess which is great because that's what they basically need to do 
 The big problem with the United States is we have our basic nine to five schedule you know 
 and we don't have the Siesta 
 and the cultural differences it's what's really hurting the Mexican people because they've had their way of life 
 and we've had our way of life 
 and
