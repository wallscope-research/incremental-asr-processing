 Okay Charles gun control 
 what are you in favor or no comment
 you are
 Well this should be very interesting because I'm against it
 Well you know now here's something that first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic weapons
 now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons
 And yet the gun control enthusiasts are preaching about the gun control and how we should have stronger laws and what not
 I don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have
 Now this is not just a state law 
 this is a federal law controlled by the Treasury Department for fully automatic weapons
 And all right now for instance in California where they passed the semiautomatic 
 or now what was it they called them 
 The military version attack weapons or something 
 how is that going to affect the sports weapons rifles that are automatic or semiautomatic
 Uh-huh 
 well now I've got to admit I'm inclined to agree with you there even though I am a member of the N R A
 and their reason being that well if you let one little law get through pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another and so forth and so on
 And you've got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way
 
 that's true 
 now did you hear about the control that they have up in Virginia
 it's a little hard to believe 
 but they can of course 
 like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law 
 Anyone ever convicted of a felony cannot purchase a weapon
 and they don't have a waiting period because they have access to computer records concerning all these felons
 And the- 
 when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in Virginia the salesman just calls some number and punches in your name 
 and if it comes up negative okay fine 
 and you get your gun right then and there
 but they are the only state that does it
 And according to Virginia it didn't cost all that much
 and frankly I don't understand why a state doesn't have those records available anyway
 at least records of known felons which are available to local police departments
 certainly those records are available
 and all they would have to do is expand it To well connect them into a modem somehow
 Well Virginia is not a particularly rich state 
 and they managed to squeak out a few bucks to do it
 And it's one-hundred percent successful
 Yeah 
 I just heard about this last week
 they were bragging about it
 with 
 they should have have pride in this because it's a good system
 and it's working well
 And they don't need that seven-day waiting period
 Because the whole idea of that waiting period was so that the police could check up on you
 Well you know what's going to happen there 
 those files are going to back up on somebody's desk just some of that typical bureaucratic work
 that's another thorn in my side bureaucratics politicians
 So anyway well we seem to be one in favor and one against
 Although neither one of us are really dyed in the wool
 we 
 but we both 
 well there should be some way of checking
 now here in Texas all you need is a driver's license
 And even felons can still get a driver's license
 So I don't think they are too 
 well they're not rigid enough here in Texas
 But don't tell the N R A I said that
 They're liable to tear up my membership
 You say you retired a year ago
 I'm looking forward to it in about just over a year myself
 
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh 
 Well I bought a motor home here four years ago
 and I have been living in it ever since
 and I'm looking forward to just traveling
 I have four sons scattered all over the country and a few grandchildren
 And I'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them
 Well Charles good luck to you on your 
 Yeah 
 nice talking to you too
 Take care now
 Bye
