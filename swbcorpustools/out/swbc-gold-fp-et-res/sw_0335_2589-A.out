 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's very true 
 I guess I can relate to that because I have two kids that are opposites like that 
 one picks up real quick 
 and the other one doesn't 
 And you're right they do get bored really fast if they already know what you're talking about 
 What do you propose that they do 
 what is your suggestions
 Uh-huh 
 Out of each child
 Each individual child
 Right
 Yeah 
 That's 
 That's true 
 I think the only thing that they would argue about that is that you know every child needs to learn every subject 
 that might be the only thing 
 But I definitely agree with you 
 Right 
 right 
 That's true 
 Yes 
 I definitely agree 
 There's no doubt about that 
 I can relate to that because I'm going to college right now 
 and I feel like I'm taking this history class 
 And it's so boring 
 and I just hate it 
 And I think why do they make us take this stuff 
 what does this have to do with getting you know a computer science degree or whatever you know 
 American History 
 We have to take like this is like early seventeen hundreds through I don't know I think like mid eighteen hundreds 
 And then we have to take another one that's mid eighteen hundreds on up to basically present
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well that's basically what they're doing
 Yeah 
 yes 
 Definitely 
 I agree 
 Yeah 
 there's 
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 yeah 
 Any way this school system thing 
 I tell you I saw something on the news I don't know maybe two weeks ago 
 And they were talking about 
 I don't know where you're from 
 but I'm from the Dallas area 
 And they were talking about the Plano school system that they had one school that if the students did something wrong whether it was behavioral or you know they weren't learning properly or something They took these students and put them basically in a closet With no windows 
 They had a table not a table but a desk in this closet 
 and they had to sit in there by themselves 
 Well parents were getting really angry about this because they said Why is my child being put in this closet 
 Well how is that helping my child you know 
 And the thing you know 
 they said Well we're giving them isolation time 
 and this helps them to think 
 But a lot of kids 
 if a child has claustrophobia that's just going to terrify him you know 
 and 
 that's true 
 That's true 
 But no 
 they were 
 I definitely agree with parents 
 I think that is a very wrong way to handle disciplining a child 
 Putting them in they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms 
 They didn't call them closets 
 But they showed these rooms you know on the news 
 and they looked like a closet to me You know with a desk in it real small 
 But they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms 
 I said how is this helping 
 either way You know I definitely had to disagree with that 
 I think that's not the way to you know discipline a child by putting him in a closet 
 Right
 Right
 Yep 
 <>
 Right
 Well 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 I don't 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Well 
 I have to 
 I think one of the things that can come out of is not just discipline okay 
 But okay 
 for instance one of the things they do at my kids school they have what they call caught being good slips 
 And when the kids are in halls and stuff and if they're being really good just being excellent they're not you know cutting up and so on 
 They're just standing in line doing whatever they are supposed to 
 they get one of these caught being good slips 
 And then when they collect them at the end of each week they get to go to this little what they call their caught being good store 
 and then they get to spend these like money 
 Well see to me that's positive reinforcement is much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids because they're going to be good and try and earn those things you know to get the positive part of it 
 they'd much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked 
 So they're definitely going to work towards being good you know rather than trying to act up and be bad you know
 Yeah 
 well that's true I think really though 
 that's one thing that my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked 
 But I really do try to use positive reinforcement with them at home also 
 And it really helps 
 And they don't get spanked very often 
 but they do when they deserve it you know 
 But I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked 
 I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child 
 But you know that's just my personal opinion 
 and that's not going to 
 I don't think that law will ever change 
 They are never going to let a teacher spank a child again 
 But I don't think 
 some kids don't get don't get spanked at home 
 and some kids need to be spanked at home 
 don't you think
 But I don't know
 Right 
 right 
 Well there's so many parents that say you can deal with a child without spanking them Which is true you can 
 But there are times when a child needs to be spanked 
 they do things that they need that
