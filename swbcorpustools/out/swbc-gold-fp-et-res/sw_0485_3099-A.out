 Okay 
 so what were you saying
 No 
 no 
 not at all 
 I work with computers
 Yep 
 they what 
 one thing I 
 I have some friends that have children not that many actually
 
 I do not really know 
 excuse me 
 too much about child care in New York 
 Excuse me one second
 Huh-uh 
 No 
 not at all 
 in fact my situation is a little bit strange 
 I was a student for many years and then graduated and went and worked in France for awhile 
 And I have just come back and was doing consulting work
 So I am just taking a little bit of time off right now
 and I might 
 Yeah 
 well hopefully I can do some consulting work at home 
 And if I can do that it will 
 Yeah
 I'll be able to spend the time with my daughter and not have to worry too much about child care 
 But I might start to go crazy with it too 
 It is a little 
 I miss the intellectual stimulation
 But at the same time it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now 
 And 
 yes
 Yeah
 Well I do not think I would put her in day care for joint situation right now unless it was like one other child with a person
 I would not want her to be in a large day care situation so young Because I think a little infant just does not get the stimulation they need
 Maybe if I needed to work part time like four hours a day I might do that cause like you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time 
 But I just think that you know when there's two year olds running around the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds
 And only when the infant screams are they going to go there 
 and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with
 And you know I play with her most of the time she is awake 
 and I think that is so important
 Yeah
 Well such as things for learning gives the child stimulation I think is important
 And 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 well she's just been doing all kinds of stuff where she's you know 
 She's two months now nine weeks
 And she's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that
 And she's just started that like yesterday or the day before
 so every days are different
 And you know I think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older 
 and I will probably be going back to work around January whereas she will be about eight or nine months old 
 And so I think you know she will be at a 
 I have heard it's a rough age to put them into a 
 Yeah
 but I think it 
 Yeah 
 We are just going to have to see how things work out 
 but I am trying to you know leave her a fair amount even at this young age with her grandparents just to go to a movie and things like that So that she is used to other people taking care of her 
 My parents 
 my husband's parents are in France 
 So it's a little bit harder 
 but during you know 
 she's met them already
 Not that she will remember them 
 but she's met them
 Uh-huh
 Are they all nearby 
 Yeah
 Well if I work part time that might be doable
 Yeah 
 well 
 right now the situation is so tight at many places that it's even hard to have a choice
 Incredible 
 but you know since this is 
 people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids 
 And you know I just find that incredible 
 And my sister-in-law is going to have a baby very very soon 
 and she is intending to stay home with the baby
 And you know maybe do some free lance type work at home 
 And so if I go back to work on a part time basis I am hoping I can leave my daughter with her Because her daughter again will be a couple of months my daughter will be about six months older than hers 
 And 
 it will be a little rough when she is a very very little infant
 but like when she is a month or so my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with baby-sitting for large families
 And so she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day 
 and we might even be able to do it on a trade off basis That I watch their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever or if she wants an afternoon off Even if she wants an afternoon just to work and not be bothered 
 we might be able to exchange that way
 And so we will just have to see how things work out 
 But you know ideally I think business should have the day care centers there whether it's the parents who take turns watching the kids or whether 
 they hire a couple of people 
 and you know parents come down to supervise or whatever
 Yeah
 Yeah
 yeah
 Yeah 
 well she's 
 my daughter does not seem to be on a real schedule yet 
 and it's probably my fault because I do not have a real schedule now
 But 
 Yeah 
 well she's been staying up late at night and you know sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me 
 Right
