 Okay
 Mostly freshwater 
 I 
 yeah 
 I used to fish when I was real young down in Galveston with my parents 
 and I never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to do anything 
 and I didn't know anybody who had a boat now 
 so I don't fish too much in saltwater
 really
 neat
 really
 What'd you do with them
 You didn't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do
 Do they have a limit on sharks 
 is that like a sport fish 
 can you actually catch those 
 and there's no limit
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 really
 Right
 Uh-huh
 no 
 I haven't 
 I don't know that I could do that 
 That looks awful tiring 
 Did you
 Didn't like it
 It looks complicated to me 
 It's a rhythm or something 
 Catching tree bass 
 right 
 Did you 
 That would have been something
 So do you fish mainly for trophies 
 or do you eat what you fish
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 You just like to sit down and watch it right
 Really
 Right
 Right
 That's nice
 Well most of my fishing is done at area lakes around here freshwater lakes
 and most of it 
 I haven't been really in a long time 
 Last time I went I actually was in Galveston trying to saltwater fish 
 and it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle 
 That was real fun
 but I went fishing at I don't know if you've ever heard of Lake Worth 
 It's a fairly new lake in Texas
 And we went fishing there last memorial day 
 *[[Memorial Day]] and I caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep 
 I was so excited 
 And that's really about it 
 Mostly just the lakes around here 
 and I fish to take home and cook 
 I don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching 
 I get a little bit of relaxation from it 
 but mainly I want to say I brought something home
 I want to say I did this 
 I was out there for a reason 
 Really
 Everybody but you
 It had to be you
 Couldn't catch one to save your life 
 How funny 
 just hoping maybe he could pull 
 Right
 Yeah
 Right
 yeah
 That would be fun
 Right 
 Hand picked 
 The weirdest fishing experience I ever had People to this day are still trying to figure out if I really caught what I think I caught 
 We were in Rockport which is close to Corpus
 and we had been fishing in a canal 
 they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area 
 and we'd been fishing in the canals 
 and all we were catching were catfish 
 and we were pretty bored with that 
 So we thought well maybe there are some crab in here 
 we'll try to catch some crab 
 So I got my chicken and all my little net and everything 
 and something 
 I had a rock to weight it down 
 something grabs and just runs with it 
 And of course there's no hook 
 so it can't be a fish
 I'm sure it's not a fish 
 right 
 And crab they don't bite like that 
 they don't just run with your food 
 So I netted it 
 and it was the ugliest fish I've ever seen in my life 
 It had real teeth like human teeth 
 and it looked archaic 
 I had no idea what it was 
 I called my father long distance just to describe the thing 
 and it had the rock in it's mouth not the chicken 
 but the rock itself is what it had grabbed 
 They say it's a dog fish from everything I've described 
 it was brown with these little white dots
 and it made a loud almost a croaking noise like a croaker does
 it was the strangest thing 
 I'll never get over that 
 To this day I don't want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because I'm sure one of those fish are there
 Uh-huh
 I've never heard of that one
 That's where it gets its name obviously 
 Uh-huh
 
 Can you eat them
 Ooh 
 I don't think I'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly 
 but 
 That's like this dog fish 
 it scared me to death
 it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died
 Oh
