 Well how do you feel about capital punishment
 you did
 Wow
 really 
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 wow
 Okay
 Wow
 Really
 Wow 
 Yeah 
 well the cases like that they should 
 if he's going to be drastic somebody has to be drastic back
 Really
 Right
 Wow
 Uh-huh 
 no remorse whatsoever 
 Well I guess in cases like you know where the guy would obviously go out and do it again you've got to do something
 Right
 Wow
 You're kidding
 Right
 Really
 Well I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun 
 really
 Okay
 Oh
 Wow 
 What 
 I guess cases like that I don't see why they wouldn't bring in the new evidence from the other case
 Okay
 Of that crime
 but he was found guilty of anoth- 
 okay
 That works
 Right
 Well they pushing the death penalty
 Wow
 Okay 
 So 
 Yeah 
 and I'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much
 That's true 
 if you're going to put him in prison for life with no chance for parole 
 That's true
 Uh-huh
 That's true 
 I don't know whether I'd stay in prison or not 
 or 
 Yes ma'am
 Yes 
 they do 
 I 
 they've had a number of cases here
 not a whole lot 
 well Jackson I heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year
 It was like last like year they had forty-nine 
 so that's going up
 But yeah 
 they have a death penalty 
 I hear of one every now and then
 And I visited the prison up here at Parchman 
 and I've been 
 I haven't 
 they won't let you on death row 
 but they'll let you look down the hall
 You can't see any prisoners 
 and it's kind of a weird feeling 
 I've been 
 they took us around on a tour you know 
 and I got to walk in the gas chamber
 and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you're sitting there saying like people have died here
 But I guess just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff the people up there
