 All right
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 That's the way we always were 
 We always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up
 So well I guess we're going to talk about children today
 So you ready 
 My children are all gone already
 they're all out on their own 
 So do you want to start first 
 do you work
 Uh-huh
 Right
 <> Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yet most of the problems we hear 
 of course maybe that's what we hear about is from organized and approved day care centers
 But maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be
 You know the individual incidence or something
 Uh-huh 
 how old is your oldest
 well he's plenty big enough then 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's the way with me 
 I worked four years one time 
 but my last two children were both entering high school age
 And they were of course gone while I was working 
 so it wasn't a problem I saw 
 and I stayed home the rest of the time
 so I didn't have that problem either 
 Now I 
 my oldest daughter she has two children 
 and they've been in day care 
 she works full time
 it's difficult 
 but yet she's the type of person that I don't know if she'd be happy staying at home
 Uh-huh
 she surprised me though 
 She's done a lot of things that I never thought she would do you know with the family because she was the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children
 So she spends a lot of quality time I think when she is with the children
 And they've used the day care most of the time 
 They tried one once 
 They had a lady come in
 And she also had a small child she brought with her 
 And it did not work out at all 
 she thought it was going to 
 She was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out in the morning 
 but the lady called 
 and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble 
 And this baby is the real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually 
 and she was having problems with her 
 and so she called and said things were okay settled down and was all right
 Well my daughter decided to call them and check 
 and things weren't okay 
 her one son was watching the soapies 
 which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies
 And the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out
 and the baby-sitter was in the kitchen with her baby
 And so that ended that episode 
 and she was most upset over finding this
 So they kind of had decided that the day care was better 
 There's more people involved 
 more than one adult they 
 and the age groups are separated <> 
 And *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 Yes
 story time 
 and this one has been particularly nice 
 it kept track of what they did
 and they would tell the parents what they did that day 
 You know if they said anything or did anything 
 So it kind of kept them 
 Yeah
 I always thought that if you were checking into a day care that you would be good to get references on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there
 Because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying you know 
 if there was a problem they would I think be more ready to tell you what it was
 They may not say anything
 And how do you judge other than from what others have what you see the cleanliness and that type of thing
 Uh-huh
 <> Uh-huh
 But it would be real difficult you know to find one and decide
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 <> Uh-huh
 Yeah
 <> Yeah
 it worked out good 
 I've decided I'm going to baby-sit my two granddaughters
 Since they'll be going back at the end of the month 
 And so I'm going to give it a try 
 I sell Avon and Stanley products
 and I've got that worked out 
 My husband he's retired 
 so he's going to deliver my products 
 so I'll do my orders and that by phone
 So I'll be able to keep that up a little bit 
 But I think I'll enjoy doing 
 Yeah 
 I think I'll enjoy 
 I guess I kind of miss having a baby around A kid around or something 
 Yeah
 Right 
 That's right 
 Well they do say you enjoy them more
 somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun they would have had them first 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 <> Yeah 
 My daughter always said she would not let me baby-sit because you do hear grandparents complaining you know because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much
 But the ones that complain a lot are the first
