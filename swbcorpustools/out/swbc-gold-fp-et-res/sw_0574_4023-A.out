 how do you feel about crime in the city 
 You say you're from Atlanta
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 do you find crime in Atlanta really 
 I live in Atlanta also
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city
 Uh-huh
 I probably agree with that
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's probably true 
 so well do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I don't think it's as bad as L A either
 I don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I don't know 
 I came to the conclusion also that you know if you are walking in a downtown area you know where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's going to just keeping your senses about you and trying not to look like a victim you know
 You know just walk in a confidently 
 and you know don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 
 Yeah 
 have you ever been mugged in Atlanta
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I've been pretty lucky about getting mugged 
 Yeah 
 I think I've only actually seen like you know one actual robbery with a gun
 and that's been about the only you know you know potentially violent crime that I've seen in Atlanta
 And that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed
 really
 where was that 
 Was that downtown 
 or 
 Really
 Metropolitan 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I've known some people that have had their cars stolen 
 and you know about half the time the A P D seems to recover them you know in various states of disrepair Up on blocks 
 My friend had a V W Rabbit 
 and when he got it back his dashboard was sitting in the front seat 
 Uh-huh
 Well you're probably luckier than 
 Uh-huh 
 so like does insurance pay for the body damage 
 or was that all there was body
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 So how do you know this much about stealing cars
