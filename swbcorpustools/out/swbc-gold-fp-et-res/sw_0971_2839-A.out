 All right
 I guess what I feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that there's got to be something 
 when we pay so much for the debt instead of using the money for where it ought to go it's ridiculous 
 What kills me is when they had a chance to put into action the Glen- Rub- 
 what is it the act where they had to cut everything across the board
 they kept putting off doing that 
 Why did they do that 
 That's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together
 yeah 
 I think so too
 Yeah 
 well Things like mailings 
 They don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things 
 They just think once they get there that they can do just anything 
 No 
 they don't try to conserve 
 And of course here at home we end up conserving and conserving 
 and when I don't have money I don't buy something
 They sure don't seem to
 There are a couple of things I think we need to really work for 
 and I don't know quite how to do it 
 But I think we need to have the one line veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything 
 If it's a good idea it can be done again
 You know and if it's not so what 
 At least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months
 Yeah 
 that's right 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on
 And the trouble is you have so little input about it 
 You don't know enough to know what to do about some of this stuff
 I 
 Yeah 
 that's right 
 The other thing about is I think limiting their time in office would be good 
 I just can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that's right 
 Yeah 
 wouldn't that be too bad 
 Well that's right 
 I think 
 I don't know 
 I think people in general 
 the idea of what you need to exist is so outrageous that it's not hardly 
 You know it starts at the courts 
 it starts everywhere until we've just lost control of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable you know
 No 
 you can't even conceive of what they're talking about
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and you just 
 the other thing is it's all very well to give money to help other people 
 and I think we need to do that 
 But they need to put more limits on them 
 They need to restrain about what they do
 Yeah <>
 you know I think that's probably unless we can afford it 
 if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again
 You know I don't really mind helping people 
 but you need to get rid of this thing that's just eating us up you know and get things on an even 
 if it were a family we'd be up before the magistrate for doing all these wicked things you know 
 but the government does it 
 and it's all right
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 Well sounds like 
 Yeah 
 it's good to see them doing some things there anyway
 Yeah
 Well 
 I think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens we're going to have to bite the bullet 
 And we're all going to have to do it 
 it just isn't fair though that when this happens in some places it needs to all come off everywhere
 That's why I thought well you know this is the time 
 They need to put that into action and show they mean business That they've got to cut costs
 Yeah 
 I think that's right 
 Well I don't really mind paying taxes for positive things that are helps like roads and making sure that that water is safe and some of these things 
 But you know you just feel like it's out of control 
 You feel like they do not have control of it 
 and so then it just aggravates you you know 
 you think I could spend my money 
 I could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing
 So it's 
 Yeah
 Well I think that's right 
 if they don't pull it in and start doing something I think they're really going to have to I think
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 in some ways we're awful lucky I guess 
 There lot of places where it's worse than it is here 
 But still you don't want it to get that bad good heavens 
 No 
 we need to try to get hold of it and have things be honest 
 and I guess in the fact I don't really mind paying taxes 
 But I would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent That they're doing something that's positive for somebody 
 I don't really feel like I use taxes very much 
 I don't know 
 maybe I do more than I 
 I guess I do 
 I use them in roads and lot of things 
 but 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 they've done some good things 
 The state actually did some good work in that a couple of years ago
 Sam Johnson came out and talked to us about what they had done 
 And they really had done some good work
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 there are a lot of places where they're in real trouble 
 and I think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too if they don't take that early stand
 Yeah 
 that's probably right 
 The growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait til they need them 
 Well it's good to talk to you
 about nine
 No 
 just a housewife 
 I just heard about it and found it fun 
 Guess I like to talk that's all 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Bye now
