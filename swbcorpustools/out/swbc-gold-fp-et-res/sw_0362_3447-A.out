 The way 
 I'll go ahead and start 
 the way I dress for work is this year nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie 
 or I shouldn't say suit but coat and tie every day
 a year ago I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group
 I guess it's a different set of standards I guess
 So I dress almost the same every day 
 pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat
 But it was very different before 
 How do you dress
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I understand
 Right
 I understand 
 that's funny 
 So does it change
 Your dress 
 no
 or I guess do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that
 So back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like 
 but probably once a month or so there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit For a customer presentation or something
 I see 
 I understand
 Well that's interesting
 Let's see what else about this 
 it seems like T I is pretty cut and dried with like two or three levels
 there's the upper management that always wears gray suits And the people that don't 
 if I want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like I used to be in that research
 and I guess you are
 That we dress in the jeans 
 and then there's kind of the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing
 But there's not much
 It's nice that there's not a requirement for it
 yeah 
 right 
 Yeah 
 I guess you see those once in a while
 Sure
 Yeah
 That's right 
 that's right 
 I guess isn't there a dress code something about spaghetti straps 
 I'm not even sure what they are
 backless 
 all right
 Okay 
 so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation 
 but I think we did it 
 Okay 
 and your name was Lisa
 Great
 I am 
 yes 
 and I work in the north building
 well thank you
 All right 
 good day
