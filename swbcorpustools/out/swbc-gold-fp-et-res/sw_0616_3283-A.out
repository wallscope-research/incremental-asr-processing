 Okay 
 We're talking about capital punishment
 How do you feel about that Lenore 
 Well wonderful 
 I am too one hundred percent
 Uh-huh
 All your life
 Uh-huh
 There's no deterrent
 That's right 
 There's just no deterrent
 And so many of those kind of people they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway 
 so you know unless they really make it rough on them going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent I don't think
 Right 
 Well I don't know what Oklahoma's laws are 
 but Texas's I don't know are 
 I don't know 
 it's no ones f- 
 it's not the judges fault I don't think 
 It's just the way the law is down here 
 Man our prisons are so crowded that they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two
 Well that's what ours did same thing
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh-uh
 It's not here either really
 I do too 
 you know but the way the courts are set up they've got so many chances for appeal 
 but I think it needs to be expedited 
 You know if they've been convicted and given an appeal and they're still convicted of a crime that's deserving of a lethal injection let's do it and not waste so many years to do it
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 That's right 
 Somehow it just doesn't 
 it works and then again it takes too long for it to work
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 it equ- 
 I do too 
 I think that needs to 
 and I don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably 
 But you know 
 Yea- 
 that's true 
 It is overcrowded because there's so much problem with the people on drugs 
 because that ha- 
 with the drugs they're robbing and killing 
 and that's why it's filled the prisons up so much I think
 No 
 it doesn't
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 With all these lawsuits and people suing people over ridiculous things 
 but 
 Boy haven't that we though 
 We really have 
 But anyway I'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the capital punishment
 I'm very muchly for it 
 Always have been
 always will be
 It could be supportive 
 it's supported with facts though
 It could very easily be supported with facts
