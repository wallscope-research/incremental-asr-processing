 we have a terrible air pollution problem
 Our summers are extremely hazardous
 and during certain wind directions because we get the Gary Indiana Chicago pollution
 and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze coming up along the lake
 And they do post warnings for people who have heart diseases or respiratory problems during that summer season 
 In the winter it's not as severe
 But if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad
 the State of Wisconsin as a matter of fact started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting
 I don't think it's going to go very far 
 but it was a way of triggering awareness
 So what's the conditions like in Dallas
 
 Wisconsin has a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag and they are tested for their pollution control equipment 
 and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it is drivable
 So they've tried to do a lot of that
 and I thi- 
 you know there seem to be at least in certain little pockets 
 and we were talking earlier about Madison
 Madison has one of the nicest bike road sharing programs of any city in Wisconsin
 and all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of bike trails for recreational use of any of the states
 And there is a real promotion of biking
 but there are still a lot of people who insist on driving their own automobiles to go everywhere 
 I find that a little irritating because I don't think it's always so necessary
 send them to Wisconsin
 and we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from the acid rain
 and they may wake up you know 
 how'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain
 It's really a serious issue for those of us up in this sector up here
 I think it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of the Gary area
 and I don't know exactly where it emerges from when it's up in the northern sectors of Wisconsin
 *[[slash error with b70: one utt]] that causes the acid rain 
 That I'm a little uncertain of 
 but I do know that it is a problem
