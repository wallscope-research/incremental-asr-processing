 Good morning
 no 
 no 
 go ahead
 very good 
 because actually when I was in college I visited Mexico several times 
 I was in the Peace Corps and Peru 
 but recently I have been following the Middle East rather than Central America <>
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 did that have 
 so you don't feel that we were exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting 
 and they weren't
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 did we tend to change their attitudes 
 like sometimes when Americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt American things Americanism consumer products T V the whole works
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh

 Yeah 
 I was in Peru 
 but I wasn't aware of that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers
 this was when the Peace Corps first are started
 and it was one of the big targets 
 and I don't think at that time at least Peace Corps was an obnoxious group in the sense that we were very controlled regarding number of days off 
 and you couldn't just take off and leave your group and go explore and things like that
 and I was working actually in the savings and loan program 
 so that was quite specialized 
 although I was living in the slums I was really working with the middle class
 I was up in Arequipa 
 And <> 
 Uh-huh <> 
 so 
 I don't have any idea 
 probably not 
 I was Peru thirteen which meant there were twelve groups before mine that had gone in 
 and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development 
 and they were building schools and doing co-ops and things like that 
 health inoculation and things
 No 
 no 
 I believe they did 
 because some of the Peace Corps that I knew of did marry Peruvians and have been back 
 and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things 
 and of course the savings and loan program that just continued to grow 
 In fact after my group 
 we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread 
 and then of course Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's something that nationalized very quickly
 And the same with the co-ops
 Right
 Uh-huh <>
 Yeah 
 you know some of the programs I would have concern about like the language teaching you know 
 why should we push English
 and a lot of people were down there teaching English 
 and when they talked about Hungary or someplace one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach language you know to me that's a little bit marginal 
 I did teach economics at the university one night a week 
 and the textbook was in English 
 but basically I taught it in Spanish because I really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test
