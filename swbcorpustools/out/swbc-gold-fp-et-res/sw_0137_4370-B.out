 I certainly can't argue with that 
 Definitely does need some improvements 
 and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to
 I think it's Four or five 
 I can't remember which 
 I was on a jury trial last year 
 only I got kicked out as the last selection that the defense got
 
 That 
 Right 
 but it still has to be a group of your peers
 See 
 So if it's your peers and you're not educated then 
 you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them 
 So that's why the defense is there picking through them whereas at the same time the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him a guilty verdict if the facts warrant
 So I think the jury selection process is pretty neat 
 but I don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards 
 I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have 
 you're talking about the person's already been found guilty right
 and many times I've seen on trials they have on T V the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever 
 but I think that it should be up to the judge and the lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be
 Maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system
 and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure Also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure
 Well preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime 
 But when it comes to sentencing for punishment of course if the person's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side
 and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury
 At least in California they're supposed to be 
 Not during the trial 
 during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background
 But when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down I think that they should
 I don't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial 
 They get too boring
 Well if it's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time
 So you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better 
 When it comes down to things like alternative sentencing I'm all for that for small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant 
 you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things
 I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are
 Yeah
 Well say embezzlement right
 You get a guy down the street who comes up carrying a kni-
