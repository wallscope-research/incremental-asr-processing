 Hello
 Hi 
 this is Betty 
 and I'm in Richardson Texas
 okay 
 well here we go 
 I guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that did some stuff over in the Gulf 
 Yeah 
 no 
 I haven't pushed one yet 
 I just 
 Okay 
 we're just sort of getting acquainted here
 you know I just wanted to see if you know you had an opinion about this 
 or you know 
 so if that's okay with you then I'll just press one
 Okay 
 Well hi 
 Good morning 
 if I start this I just wanted to say that one of the things that I don't think we really understood about the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are 
 and they think differently 
 and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours 
 and right now I think that that's been proven in the fact that they have just 
 well anyway I just think that you know the United States policy over there 
 I think we should just leave them alone 
 I really do in a major way because that whole region over there I think needs to settle it's own differences within itself
 And that's the course that they should go 
 you know we can maybe help them a little bit prompt them 
 but I don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on 
 the thing with Israel and Palestine I believe that should be settled between them 
 And also you know the other thing is our idea of democracy has nothing to do with them 
 I'm talking about the whole middle ea- 
 and maybe this is too general 
 but I just believe that they do not look at democracy the same way we do 
 They don't understand it as we don't understand the way they live
 And so you know trying to put like a square peg in a round hole is just you know 
 I don't think that that's the way to go in this 
 and you know that's a couple thoughts on it
 I guess you know I'd like you to maybe express something here
 Yeah
 That's 
 yeah
 Well ye- 
 well yeah 
 I guess we could be a catalyst for their change 
 I 
 the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there 
 and I don't think we'd be talking about this you know the Palestinian situation sort of came to a head unless there had been a war 
 that was one thing that came out of it good or bad 
 I don't judge any war as good or bad 
 it's just a war
 And I don't see any winners or losers 
 I just see dead bodies 
 I'm sorry You know 
 but I just think you know you're right 
 and I think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along 
 It's not going to be that we're going to you know sort of tell them to go to their room 
 and that's going to solve the whole problem
 It's going to be them
 Yeah
 And you know 
 It's 
 Yeah 
 that's true too 
 I 
 well yeah 
 they understand violence 
 They love violent leaders to you know 
 look at you know the leader they had 
 they just adored him because he was so strict and cruel 
 and you know for a while there he had them be- 
 Well it has a lot to do with their religion 
 I got to say that over there 
 and I know this only because from personal experience that I'm speaking of this 
 because I've you know traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where I've done that 
 and one of the kindest people I've ever met in my whole life is from that area of the country 
 and he is abounding in kindness let's say
 And his wife is so godly every thought 
 they have a totally different life than we have
 You know and when you add the commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them
 And they have very basic life 
 well it's just a very basic life 
 and they just really believe in Allah or God or whatever
 And you know everything is to the glory of Allah 
 you know and it's almost like 
 Yeah 
 well that's see using that 
 yeah
 And it's always been military 
 and it's always been 
 and that's always been the way of the world Don't you think 
 Yeah 
 So it's really hard when you see the leaders compared to the people 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Right 
 and surrendering 
 that was 
 Yeah
 it just really comes down to people are people you know 
 you have to have some compassion some humanness
 Doesn't matter where the boundaries are you know 
 there are political boundaries 
 and those are man made boundaries 
 but you know for heaven sakes that's something that's been going on for ages
 Yeah 
 that's true
