 well I don't know 
 What do you think
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 
 Well what about required drug testing as a condition of employment
 It thing actually 
 I have worked at Texas Instruments
 And they instituted a Drug testing policy where they randomly would test employees
 and actually to tell you the truth I really did not think much about it 
 I hadn't you know 
 it really didn't relate to me 
 But there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they get a false positive you know what recourse do you have
 And also this is against the law for the government to do this kind of big brother activity 
 and yet a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments although they don't admit to it actually a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure

 Well what about this AIDS epidemic now 
 Where you find that you know certain people actually are criminal in their disregard for others 
 Yeah 
 and of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't 
 it destroys their libido
 Now you know if they ever 
 So what about that as an invasion of privacy
 So really 
 it gets to balancing personal freedom against the general welfare of society
 Well it's supposed to have been
 No 
 it 
 A growing part
 Uh-huh
 Maybe chop their weenies off
