 yes
 Yes 
 very much
 As a matter of fact I prefer public television
 And I particularly enjoy the English comedies and the English mysteries
 Yes
 Vociferously
 Yes
 Well unfortunately for us at least here in the United States the only access we have to that of course is public television
 I'm not a great television watcher in any respect 
 but the watching 
 what I do watch is usually news and whatever is on public television 
 Any kind of 
 I also am very fond of great performances in that regard
 But 
 No 
 no 
 no 
 as a matter of fact Turner Broadcasting has been broadcasting all of the James Bond movies every night this week 
 so I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies this week 
 Well they're showing LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment
 and it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven
 So 
 No 
 no 
 that's true 
 I was just thinking that today he did well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in his early movies
 Whereas Sean Connery has maintained the how would you ruddy look 
 but *[[needs slash]] yes
 Well you know when was it last year or year before last he was voted the sexiest actor in movies or something
 the man is sixty-two years old
 but otherwise you know we 
 with P B S and so forth 
 And I particularly enjoy I don't know whether you've had a chance to watch it on P B S but the series YES MINISTER
 That was about the Interior Minister 
 it was a comedy
 the Interior Minister in England with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I know 
 Well I'm not much of a television watcher 
 I read as I said quite a bit 
 I read about two or three novels a week in addition to all the technical stuff 
 what do you do 
 What kind of work do you do
 At T I
 I see
 Uh-huh 
 Well the last two people who have called both worked for T I 
 and I just wondered
 I think that's something we all ca- 
 No 
 no 
 I work for G T E In Maryland 
 yes
 I guess not
 How did I hear about it 
 Well I work you know 
 they are gathering a data base for voice processing
 And that's my field of work also
 So I know the people at T I who are doing this 
 and I heard about it 
 so I called them and asked if I could participate And You know send in the forms et cetera and so forth
 We could go back to television shows 
 Yes 
 I have
 Well no 
 That's 
 you could interpret it that way
 I think what they are trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth 
 but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably after the what is it the King James Version when the committee wrote the translation that so much was lost in the translation particularly since most of the translations were in Greek
 Well for example In Greek there are seven different words for love
 Okay 
 so you can have 
 there's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one word for you know love of your father and that sort of thing 
 So as to those types of interpretations really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now and what it's at
 So that's you know 
 you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true 
 but there's too much historical fact involved just from the histories that were developed around that time that are available To deny that at least the majority of it is true 
 So you know it depends on how you look at it
 You can look at it you know 
 if you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true then you can very much look at it that way
 Yeah 
 well Well you can interpret the T V show in the same way that you can interpret the Bible
 So 
 But as far as that goes we at least agree on what we enjoy
 But I don't know if there is a time limit on this so 
 I think so too 
 Let's just 
 it's been very pleasant talking to you
 and have a good evening
 Good night
