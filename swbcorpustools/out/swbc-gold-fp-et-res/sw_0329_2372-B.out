 constantly
 It seems everything I do is computer related
 And if it goes down then we're stuck all day
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Well I have an I B M P S two model thirty
 It's kind of getting too slow for me 
 but I'm an E D P auditor 
 so I audit computer applications both on the personal computer and the mainframe level
 And I use my personal computer constantly 
 not only do I do P C type things like using lotus or word processors
 I also use my P C to emulate a mainframe terminal for our I B M mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine
 So all I have on my desk is my P C 
 but I'm getting not only our local area network 
 but I'm getting two separate mainframe machines also
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Yeah <>
 Yeah 
 I've become kind of the P C guru in our audit department because it's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground
 And there's three of us E D P auditors 
 and one of the three of us has an accounting background 
 and so she's not real proficient in P C's 
 and the other just has not used P C's that much 
 so I ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing 
 and I'm the administrator for our local area network 
 And I need to keep that going 
 and So I couldn't live my life without a P C 
 I don't have one at home
 Yeah 
 Right now I would rather not have one at home because I would work at home
 we've got a couple of portable lap top P C's at the office that I end up bringing one of them home a lot to do work 
 If I had a machine already installed at home I would probably work just about every night 
 <> Yeah
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 And it's not fast enough for a new four eighty six chip 
 but I don't know if my boss will spring for it
 But I'm determined to brake mine 
 so he has to get me another one
 We think about that a lot
 Well that's what I do 
 We had a printer a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer
 And we had about ten people sharing this printer 
 it was attached to like a central P C 
 and you had to take your diskette to the P C to print something
 So the first thing <> when I started working at this bank is I said well now first of all we need to all be able to share this P C without getting up 
 So I talked my boss into investing in a real elaborate local area network
 but we can share the printer 
 and we can send files to each other
 And we can send mail messages to each other which is good enough 
 it's what we need
 And then I talked them into buying a H P Laser Jet
 And that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it 
 But once he bought it he has been so pleased 
 it's fast 
 it's quite 
 it has good copy
 Yeah 
 I've got a little I B M Pro Printer on my desk
 and I can use either the Pro Printer 
 or I've got my P C configured to where I can use either printer The one that's on the network or my own
 So if I just need something real quick I don't feel like getting up and going and getting what I printed 
 I can just print it in my office
 Yeah
 They have gotten really cheap 
 Hewlett Packard makes it's actually a dot matrix printer
 but the quality is almost laser quality
 And I think it's called the desk jet 
 and you understand I think they're about five hundred dollars now
 really
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 So that's all you need for like charts and stuff 
 You don't need them in four colors
 Yeah
 You use the sneak- system
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer
 Until they got off the machine
 That was 
 I was amazed when I came to work 
 I worked at the 
 well it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came up and bought the rival 
 and And now N C N B's got a little larger market share 
 but it's the only 
 well it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas 
 It's the only one that's still alive
 Any way I work in a big prestigious place
 And I couldn't believe when I walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this huge holding company sharing a H P Rugged Writer 
 I was going wait a minute 
 Come on guys 
 this is crummy
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 We're pushing real hard though 
 we're trying 
 well see the entire bank is not like that 
 We 
 the bank philosophy is one of innovation and Lead the market 
 It's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the senior vice president over audits is cheap
 And it's real hard to pry money out of him to do these things 
 but I was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better 
 and 
 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Unfortunately the computer equipment and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly 
 like for instance we bought a <>
