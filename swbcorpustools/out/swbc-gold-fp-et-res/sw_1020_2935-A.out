 Well what kind of garden do you have
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Do you have a lawn
 yeah
 Well actually it 
 we've sort of had an ideal Spring
 And the peonies have been out for now about three weeks
 and the roses have been blooming for two weeks 
 and the grass is this lush green 
 and of course I've got lots of weeds in mine because I don't use any poison either
 But you know I just keep looking at 
 and I say Jeez you know this is the first year it's been so perfect
 and my garden you know 
 my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall
 the plants and 
 you know I'm going Gee this can't you know 
 we'll have a freeze
 Well that's it 
 Last year I think it was you know my peonies were budding in January 
 and you know there was no way that was going to make it 
 and sure enough you know we had really mild weather until I think it was May or something
 and then you know everything just got hit hard 
 but yeah 
 it's interesting 
 and I enjoy gardening 
 My son does the mowing of the grass
 I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody the mowing 
 Uh-huh
 they help you
 dear 
 but that's nice you know 
 the peach tree is a start 
 and 
 Right 
 What about tomatoes 
 aren't they pretty hardy
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I would assume too 
 you've got three or four months you're talking about of bad weather
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 dear
 Sounds like it would have been pretty
 sure 
 sure
 Well it sounds like you've got your hands full 
 And you know gardening isn't high on the list 
 but it's not off the list
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Right 
 Maybe next year they'll do better
 Okay 
 well thanks
 It was nice talking to you too 
 Bye-bye
