 So what do you 
 what's your opinion on the our policy down there
 I didn't know we had one either 
 Yeah 
 I don't 
 Yeah 
 The only thing that I pretty much know about is the Central American policy where you know they're just trying to you know 
 military action in Panama is the only thing that comes to my mind right now
 and then 
 Right 
 Right 
 Well that's that's what I was about to say 
 We didn't do anything
 Yeah
 that is that is pretty uh risky 
 I mean 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 He takes more risks 
 Yeah 
 He was 
 Yeah 
 It seems that the the policies of pretty much anywhere not just in Central America that U S has now is is you know more action than just words than just rhetoric 
 But you know if we we back up what we s- what we say with actions
 I don't know how long it's going to last 
 Yeah
 Well I don't think it's possible because even though you know we're against them I don't think we can go into another country and do something about the other country's problem
 Yeah 
 But 
 no 
 but see the thing when Panama was uh the that uh Noriega was uh was was uh was wanted fo- either the F B I by the F B I 
 and therefore they had a reason 
 But to go in and take out the whole drug kingdom would be something totally different because 
 Right
 Uh no 
 I didn't 
 Oh the drug problem
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I don't think uh I don't think the the uh problem about drugs is going to be safe any time soon 
 I mean you know it I think it pretty much got sidetracked with uh with the Panama and and with the C- Cent- Middle East problems 
 Things that that are important take precedent precedence over the drugs I think 
 I think I think the big thing is trying to stop here on the home front 
 And bef- 
 you know it it'll take a little bit of time before they'll realize that this is failing 
 so they're going to have to go to the source
 Don't want to admit it yet 
 Right 
 Yep {Pause} 
 Yeah 
 That's true
 Yeah 
 Huh 
 Depends on how much power you have and who you know 
 Yeah 
 Probably 
 Huh
 I don't drink Scotch
 Yeah 
 I think we're trying to stay uh stay friendly with uh the uh the Brazilian and and Argentinean governments because they're producing so much uh agricultural exports 
 We don't want to piss them off and have them over produce 
 and then because then our economy would be pretty bad Yeah 
 I think it's going to have to get worse before it gets better 
 you know the same old cliche 
 Right 
 Right 
 And they'll just pick crooked people again 
 And then people the the wrong people will just fight their way up to the top again 
 and it'll all be for nothing 
 Yeah 
 Well I guess that's about five minutes 
 Appreciate talking to you 
 Hey what was that book 
 what was that book that you were saying to read again
 A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER 
 Okay 
 All right 
 All right 
 Thanks a lot 
 Bye-bye
