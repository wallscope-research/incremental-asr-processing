 Okay 
 do you vote regular 
 Every one
 Well see that's me 
 I've never paid any attention to voting
 Huh-uh
 Unless you have something to do with it
 Right
 liberal 
 what do you mean by liberal 
 Well see I don't know anything about politics
 what's the main difference between Republicans and Democrats
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Okay 
 and you vote for the Democrats 
 or 
 Usually
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 okay
 No 
 I never have
 Huh-uh
 I'm twenty-six
 I know I 
 well I don't know that much about it
 I don't keep up on it 
 and I don't feel like I have enough knowledge on it you know to pick the right person
 So that's what they need well they said something to improve voting
 If they could <> make it easier to find out you know what's going on 
 Do you know what I mean
 like to me I didn't know what would have been wrong with 
 I can't even remember who ran for president against Bush 
 I think it was that woman
 wasn't it a woman
 Dukakis
 Okay 
 didn't he have a woman 
 or was that Reagan 
 There was a woman that was running for vice president for a while
 Ferraro
 Okay 
 Well that's what I mean 
 like I didn't know what the difference between Dukakis and Bush was
 You know I didn't know anything about Bush or Dukakis 
 Okay 
 I don't remember anything about Dukakis
 but well they're all saying that they're going to do you know whatever is best for their campaign anyway
 That's what I mean 
 if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and 
 I don't know 
 like you know in school they didn't teach you about the government not really
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Well I'm not sure they're 
 yeah 
 I know how they do it
 It 
 like with the abortion issues and stuff
 Right
 Right 
 and like I said most of the politicians I'm 
 also the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway
 And everybody's got you know stuff they don't want known
 Well anyway I'm sorry 
 I didn't have much knowledge
 I don't even remember this being on there
 Incentive
 I guess that would be good 
 now I'm sure they've got it at the library you know
 if I get to the library 
 I've got two babies so I don't 
 yeah
 But I don't know 
 I know if enough people think like that it you know would make a difference if people stopped thinking like that
 well a lot of people they'll vote the way their family votes you know
 since you're what Democrat *[[slash error]] Then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote Democrat 
 right
 
 No
 All split
 Right
 I lie 
 I don't know 
 if I did understand politics I probably would vote more
 But like I said if I voted for Bush <> 
 or like when Gary Hart was running a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking 
 not that I think he was good looking 
 but he was young
 And then I didn't think that was right because he may have been a good president or whatever
 because it 
 what 
 he had an affair
 and it just threw him out of the whole running
 And a lot of people go by their personal life when they vote 
 and 
 Which I guess if you got turmoil in your personal life you're going to let it come into work 
 but I'm sure there's a lot of people that have had 
 Yeah
 Well
 Well criminal or something like that's different
 but if him and his wife weren't getting along 
 what effect does that have on him running for president 
 Do you know what I mean
 It's all so secretive 
 see we really don't see the true person anyway
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Well what did you think of Reagan as a president
 Do you think he won from Carter because of the hostages that were held at that time
 Uh-huh
 I thought Carter was good too 
 and that was 
 yeah
 But I think I wasn't 
 well let's see 
 that's been about ten years ago right
 Okay 
 so I was only fifteen or sixteen 
 but I remember Carter 
 and I liked him
 No 
 I sure don't
