 well I'm not sure how it is in Georgia 
 but in Pittsburgh the crime rate really is not very high at the moment 
 is that true for Atlanta
 Yeah 
 I 
 that's probably not true only for Atlanta but for just about anywhere
 Well the least from what's on the news there are very few like actual robberies reported of residences 
 What's more likely to occur is you know knocking over a small store or a car theft you know things of that nature 
 Very few assaults 
 although on the college campuses there are cases of you know like people getting from an automated teller and you know somebody trying to device a scam for getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners
 But mostly petty things and nothing really too big
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 a strange case that happened oh it's about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine
 It was a free standing machine 
 and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it
 Now there's a crime for you
 Yeah 
 but I guess most of the things that happen around here are pretty innocuous 
 Although from what I hear in the news 
 and I saw an episode of the T V show COPS one time that was in Pittsburgh 
 and it did surprise me because you know they were doing drug arrests and things like that 
 but I don't really think those things happen too often because like I said from what's reported in the news at least it's not all that common
 Yeah
 Yeah
 You know just to diverge a little bit I live in an apartment 
 Right now I'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh 
 and the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in 
 But even so it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to like lock the doors when they go out you know and things like that
 it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when people are here and when they're not just come in you know 
 there's a T V and a V C R 
 and they could get in pretty easy and especially since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open you know while they're upstairs playing music 
 it could still happen then
