 Okay
 Capital punishment
 for myself I'm personally against it 
 but we seem to have a duality of in this country where most states in theory have it but do not use it
 Okay well
 Texas uses it about as much as any other state
 Texas is a big state
 here in Maryland to the capital punishment law 
 people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment but no one actually has the sentence carried out 
 I'd certainly 
 Uh-huh 
 I think so
 I 
 or affair number 
 in fact I think that it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available 
 the sentence of life without possibility of parole has become a common one and is being used much more
 I don't know the exact numbers 
 but yes 
 prisons are overcrowded
 
 Okay 
 you're certainly in the majority at least in this country
 we are I guess the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment
 No 
 at least not in Western Europe 
 Probably not in Eastern Europe these days either 
 there are many reasons for it 
 but they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates
 Well in part it's the nature of societies perhaps more homogenous society in many cases 
 arguably if 
 arguably is because of welfare state benefits 
 we tend to be skeptical
 Yes 
 there's no question that you know they have you know all kinds of cradle to grave programs welfare programs providing for everyone some way 
 I 
 however the question is is that making the difference
 Oh
 I think that idea is even more common in Western Europe
 Uh-huh
 Me too
