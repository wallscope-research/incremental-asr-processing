 Okay
 Okay 
 the last movie I saw was the FIVE HEARTBEATS 
 and I liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it
 Yeah 
 it's Robert Townsend movie
 I don't know all the actors or anything 
 but it was a lot of music a lot of old songs things like that
 it's still out now 
 it came out I guess about a month or about a month and half ago something like that 
 It's about a Black singing group 
 It 
 and it was called the DELLS
 And it was kind of like just about their life and their history and things like that and how they went from stardom to nonstardom
 And that was pretty good 
 I enjoyed 
 I saw DANCES WITH WOLVES 
 Have you seen that
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 right now Kevin Costner he's starring in everything 
 He's doing the Kennedy movie that's coming out 
 and there's one 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 starring Kevin Costner 
 and let me see 
 what else 
 he's doing some other movie 
 I can't 
 I think ROBIN HOOD that's it 
 the ROBIN HOOD coming out 
 and he's going to be in also 
 And let me see 
 what else have I seen 
 What have you seen
 I know what you're talking about
 My 
 It's called REVIEWING MY LIFE or something like that
 Yeah 
 I didn't get to see that
 Yeah 
 that's it 
 okay
 Uh-huh
 One of my favorite movies it's not one that I haven't seen 
 I w- 
 it's not a late movie 
 It's FATAL ATTRACTION 
 It's probably my all time 
 well not all time favorite 
 but one of my favorites that I can watch over and over
 No 
 I never did 
 I heard it was really good 
 I've just haven't gone out to see it 
 Was that pretty funny
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 somehow just never made it to see that 
 but I need to see it
 Yeah 
 FATAL ATTRACTION I don't know why I like that movie so much 
 I guess it was so much suspense
 And I like suspense
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 yeah 
 on that order
 Certainly is
 And I liked the woman that played in that 
 I forgot what her name is now
 Anne Archer <> she was the wife in FATAL ATTRACTION 
 yeah
 and she played in narrow margin which was a little more recent
 and that was kind of another suspense type Alfred Hitchcock type thriller
 That was good 
 God I guess I haven't seen too many movies lately 
 I need to 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Somehow 
 it's hard for me to get to movies now because it's getting so expensive you know 
 I'd rather rent
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and that's just for a bucket of popcorn you know
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 God forbid you should want something to drink with it 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 easily
 And you're usually going to go to dinner or something with that
 Yeah
 It's almost more fun really 
 yeah 
 it's almost more fun really to rent movies You know just kind of stay at home maybe
 Yeah 
 that's true too
 Yeah 
 but then you can make your popcorn and you know be comfortable
 Uh-huh
 Well that's about all the movies I've seen recently 
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I never did
 Was that Arnold Schwarzenegger
 Yeah 
 yeah
 There's a movie I do want to see 
 I haven't seen it 
 what is it 
 KISS BEFORE DYING
 it looks pretty suspenseful
 Are you looking in the paper
 Oh
 yeah 
 that was great
 Yes 
 that might be one of my all time favorites too 
 that was an excellent movie 
 It was pretty scary because I was visiting a V A Hospital near to where I live 
 and they were saying that some of the patients there you can't leave by themselves because they'll make a weapon out of anything you know 
 out of a piece of paper they can kill somebody you know
 And this guy in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS Hannibal Lector he was that kind of person 
 and you 
 they couldn't leave him alone 
 and that's what was so scary about the movie you know Because he was such an awesome character you know 
 it was really fas- 
 he was very dangerous 
 but you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating
 but they couldn't leave him alone at all 
 And they found out what happened when they did leave him alone one time 
 but I won't tell you that just in case you see the movie
 Uh-huh 
 very good
 yeah 
 yeah 
 I'm not sure when it will be hitting video stores 
 it should be a while yet though
 I haven't heard anything about it 
 I 
 but I don't like Steven Seagal things 
 so 
 He's had OUT FOR JUSTICE 
 and there was one right before that with a similar title 
 like I don't know some macho title 
 That's why I just don't like the 
 yeah 
 it is 
 I don't like that a lot 
 I don't watch a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything like that either
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that might be good though 
 that might be good
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 I guess I'm not fond of the action packed movie where they're always chasing or fighting 
 or you know 
 I like the movies that make you think
 No 
 I haven't seen that yet 
 and that's something I really should have seen 
 Was that good 
 did you see it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 a friend of mine saw it 
 and she said it was okay you know 
 it wasn't anything spectacular
 Yeah 
 the previews looked so good <> that I wanted to see it 
 but I never did 
 Yea- 
 well I saw half of it 
 and I remember I was in school I saw half of it 
 and I fell asleep 
 and everyone else watched it 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I really need to go see the original one 
 I'm sure it was a good movie 
 I probably had a test that day or something 
 I don't know
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 I think though that movies are losing their luster
 I think movies are losing their attractiveness just to a lot of people 
 Just 
 I think 
 I don't know 
 because of the cost 
 and I think it's just losing its originality or something 
 I don't 
 I can't pinpoint it
 But it doesn't seem like it's as big rage to get the movie theater as it used to be
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 exactly
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
