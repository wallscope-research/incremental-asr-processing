 Yes 
 and I hate it 
 How about you
 Off and on 
 well I guess I've been kind of off and on 
 I've Had some health problems that have led me to 
 I'd say more on than off 
 I do walking on the treadmill 
 and then I do low impact aerobics
 not really
 Yeah 
 and time consuming 
 it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming 
 it's you know afterwards you know 
 then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know
 yeah
 is this something that you go through every year 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 a lot of things do that 
 I had an exercise bike 
 I use to have one 
 and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it 
 but I do use my treadmill 
 Yeah 
 it's nice because when the weathers bad you don't have any excuse
 Yeah 
 I can't ride a bike 
 so 
 Oh
 Yeah 
 it's too nice 
 it's been too nice all weekend
 Have you ever had any injuries from jogging
 I guess it worries me about jogging that I hear that it's very hard on your body and that you know you can end up getting hurt worse
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's not quite so easy
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I found that true especially from walking on toe and fronts 
 Well I guess my breakdown they say about every six months
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well don't let it collect dust 
 At least exercise while dusting it off 
 well 
 Yeah 
 that'll be good
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Are you going to do that
 Well that sounds like something good to do then
 Yeah 
 nice way to start off this spring Get back in shape
 Well I do 
 I switch every other day 
 one day I walk 
 and one day I do the aerobics
 Well I'm trying to get my tolerance now 
 I just had surgery less then two months ago 
 and right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half
 but I'm trying to workup to three miles
 Yeah
 it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect
 Yeah 
 but 
 My walkman broke
 so I'm upset 
 and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud 
 Yeah 
 it is 
 and this doesn't you know 
 my treadmill has an incline 
 and you know you can get a really good workout on it
 No 
 I just do it on T V
 I have a cassette
 it's a tap- 
 I use tapes
 or Richard Simmons
 Sweating to the oldies 
 Uh-huh
 There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N 
 I don't know if he's still on any more or not 
 I don't know if I get E S P N or not 
 But one you know 
 I use to watch one on the air 
 but that was back 
 That's was 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I watched that cause he was cute 
 But 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 But then that was back when you know the high impact and 
 Do they
 Are the- 
 yeah 
 he's still doing it then 
 I'll have to tune in
 I'll have to check it back up 
 but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show at least on 
 Not everybody has a picture perfect body
 I haven't watch any other ones on T V Just on some of the tapes
