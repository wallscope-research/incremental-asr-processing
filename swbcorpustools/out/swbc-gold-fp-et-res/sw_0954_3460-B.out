 I was just now told that's what the topic was 
 and I guess invasion of privacy to me for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards for example 
 And I guess recently one of the T V stations here ran a series of news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers And use it 
 and I was quite surprised at that 
 I guess I can consider myself fortunate that it never happened to me
 I don't know what I'd really do if it did
 
 No 
 not really because I'm listed in the phone book 
 If I was the type of individual that had an unlisted number I think I would be hesitant to give it
 One of the things that upset me when I lived in California was they did a lot of things with your Social Security number
 As a matter of fact they even went to the point of printing our Social Security number on your driver's license
 And they would not cash checks unless they had your Social Security number 
 so we had our Social Security numbers imprinted on our checks
 And I was really you know unhappy about that situation 
 I think that was an invasion of privacy
 Right
 One of the biggest things I think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of mail lists and things like that
 You know recently I purchased some magazines U S NEWS and FORBES magazine
 And every since that day I have been inundated with you know subscriptions to this subscriptions to that this news letter this investment letter even to the point of people calling me at home 
 And prior to me ordering these magazines I never got those kind of calls
 And 
 Uh-huh
 From some list 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 All their time
 Sure
 I think the general public would be you know tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for let's say the criminal individuals to get access to people's records their credit cards driver's licenses checks things like that
 I don't think anybody really knows what to do about it
 Computers caused a lot of this I'm sure
 Sure
 Seems as though they are 
 yeah
 Unfortunately
 Fortunately I haven't been inundated with that situation yet
