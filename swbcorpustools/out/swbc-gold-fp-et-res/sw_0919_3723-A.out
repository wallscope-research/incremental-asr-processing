 Ok 
 I was watching the soap opera awards
 And it is really making me want to exercise 
 because every single woman in the audience is about ten pounds
 So I started exercising about last Spring when I joined the President's Health Club
 And I was really motivated and going 
 and I went for a little while 
 I went pretty regular 
 but it is hard to go regularly for a long time
 And where I live in Waco they do not have anywhere here that is affiliated with President's 
 so now I do not have a club 
 and I do not have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly or something like that 
 so I am not exercising at the moment 
 So I wish I could 
 I wish I did have the motivation to get out and do that 
 but I just do not like just running with no where to go 
 I just cannot do that 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I think a lot of the times if you have someone to work out with or walk with or something it does give you that motivation
 And you can you know pretty much do it privately if you had your own private sort of contest You know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that
 And that would keep you going
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 That is very true 
 It seems like you walk quicker 
 You just 
 perky is a good word for it when you exercise
 And I understand that walking is suppose to be like the best exercise 
 Better than running
 Things like that 
 cause it works everything
 and it gets your breathing up
 and it doesn't 
 yeah 
 it doesn't hurt you 
 Like I understand running hurt your shins or knees or something like that
 So 
 Wow
 Wow
 Yeah
 oh 
 I guess my favorite exercise in the gym is the bikes
 To go 
 yeah 
 there are these stationery bikes that you just ride 
 and if you watch television they usually have television in there or something or if you listen to a walkman it is pretty okay 
 Again that is sort of weird because you are not going anywhere 
 and I use to play racquetball
 and I really liked that because you know to me it had a point
 You know there were points you would make 
 and there was a point to it 
 but running and jogging and just not going anywhere is just 
 I don't like that 
 I just can't understand that 
 So I don't do 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I know a lot of people just to be safe 
 like you were talking about walking at night and in the morning or early in the morning 
 you see a lot of mostly older people though that walk in the malls
 You know like early in the mornings and things like that 
 I have never tried that
 I don't know 
 You know I have never even thought about it really
 
 Oh
 Uh-huh 
 And that is a little less
