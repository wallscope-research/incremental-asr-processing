 So you know my feeling is that it's really being used today 
 it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal
 Right 
 because you've got all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses
 and you know it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly don't think the people that are committing the crimes that would be eligible you know really care
 Right 
 it's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon you know 
 I'm invulnerable 
 I don't need to care about this 
 You know I'm never going to get caught
 Yeah 
 one way or another
 Yeah 
 but the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life there's a chance that he might do things in prison you know and somehow redeem himself
 Well You know so that you know 
 you know the other problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent you know 
 There are cases where you know twenty thirty years after the fact of getting evidence especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence then oops 
 I'm sorry 
 guess we killed the wrong guy
 Right 
 you can apologize nicely 
 but you know you know I think you know the price you know 
 I've heard quotes you know it's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned I think is really the philosophy of the way our legal system works
 Yeah 
 and you know I think that you know 
 and the way it's being used now it's like you listen to Bush you know 
 well where are we going to impose d- you know 
 it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in 
 Tsongas is also saying you know make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer
 And again I don't thing these people care 
*[[typo replace thing with think]] They risk their lives every day
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and you know especially now I live in Massachusetts you know 
 we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something
 So you know 
 but you look at our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to like Texas or someplace that does you know it's impossible to make a case that it's affecting it in any way
 I think it's mainly people like they get the vengeance of it
 Because you know 
 yeah
 it's lot of blacks 
 Also a lot of young people 
 You know a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I've seen
 And you know I think when you listen to like the victims' families and things they're always talking about you know feeling justified or feeling you know like they've gotten something out of it 
 my thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever if he gets killed it shouldn't make any difference to the victim's family 
 The only thing that should really 
 obviously if someone of mine who has close died I'd probably feel differently 
 but you know the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society
 Right 
 the 
 Right 
 and the other thing is that you know I was reading through a book on human geneo research
 and there more and more things like schizophrenia 
 and why does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin
 So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say well the problem is you've got an endorphin imbalance 
 and you know if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society you know 
 you really get back to the question of you know is someone responsible for their actions
 Society made me do it
 Yeah
