 Do I have pets 
 Yes 
 I have a cat 
 and I have two dogs
 I have a Schnauzer 
 and I have a Sheltie
 it's a miniature
 Uh-huh
 okay
 Well the Schnauzer I'm watching for one of the managers where I work 
 and he's been transferred to Germany for a while
 and I'm taking care of his dog 
 and I had just got the kitten when he asked me that 
 and he says well my dog doesn't like cats
 and I said well we won't tell her it's a cat because it was a kitten 
 and you know they just love kittens
 They just are fascinated
 So she doesn't know that this is a cat yet
 And they get along real good 
 I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty he'd flip
 *[[listen]] So that was interesting 
 It's a sheltie
 She's real sweet little dog 
 She's got a very nice temperament 
 they're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer
 You know the Schnauzers are a little aggressive
 Uh-huh
 They're a good temperament
 and they just 
 they 
 I think they have a good head on their shoulders 
 I think they have a higher level of intelligence than other dogs that I have encountered
 Well yeah 
 but also some poodles 
 they're kind of 
 there are some smart ones out there 
 but there's also some not so smart ones 
 Yeah 
 maybe there's some credence in that statement
 Uh-huh
 I really don't know what the best pet is 
 I guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal
 *[[slash error]] And bull dogs 
 But I don't know about these now what are they called pit bulls that are so vicious
 Are they really 
 I don't think I've ever seen one 
 Well how do they become s- 
 w- 
 how did they get their reputation then
 they train them to be that way then
 okay
 okay
 dear 
 so the poor animal is doing it in self protection
 dear
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's unusual 
 I 
 well I suppose you were surprised
 After the reputation that you know 
 they have quite an notable reputation as far as you know 
 Yeah 
 they're banned in some areas I understand
 Uh-huh
 You know that 
 they must have just targeted that breed and said boy we're going 
 okay
 okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 did it attack the child then
 Uh-huh
 Well the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that 
 *[[slash error]] Sure 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 because then the animal's in trouble and not the person
