 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well okay 
 most of the commercial television these days I'm just a little bit sick of 
 in fact I don't watch hardly any television at all with my other activities 
 between my family and my church et cetera et cetera well I hardly any time to sit down and watch the news 
 Now I do watch the Discover channel and some on channel thirteen 
 but aside from that I pretty well turn it off
 Uh-huh
 I don't blame you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well it 
 sometimes if it's real good 
 like there's been more than one evening that I've caught every animal show that evening on on the Discover channel
 And because you know they're documentaries and they're 
 you bet 
 in fact I'm glad that it's part of our basic cable package
 But 
 Uh-huh
 me too
 Hello 
 Well they whooped up on them
 Uh-huh 
 and they're in the playoffs 
 and I'm not sure that the Eagles are not
 I did
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Did you know everybody or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson 
 but he's brought the pokes from a one and something team to playoffs in what three years now
 Uh-huh 
 well you know it was the time for the passing of the guard 
 And I think Tom knew it
 So 
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 and I wouldn't have blamed him one bit because 
 yeah 
 but see nobody remembers him as a loser because he's far too much of a gentleman and a practicing Christian to ever be thought of as anything you know but a winner 
 Yeah
 he is 
 he is
 because he has to like himself before he can like other people 
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 he will
 Right 
 Well nobody's going to forget Tom Landry
 Shoot come now 
 I'd not a 
 you betcha 
 I'm not a native Texan by birth 
 but I guess if length of time I'm in the state now is after you're here twenty years you're considered native
 Well let's see 
 I came down March of sixty-nine went to work for T and I
 Yeah
 So I haven't looked back yet either 
 so 
 Right 
 Especially looking at some of the weather New York state has had
 and then look at the weather we have down here 
 Huh 
 Uh-huh
 goodness
 Well well we're finished with all but the last one and trying to get him through his technical school
 and he's over halfway 
 so 
 You know we're not staying on the topic of television shows 
 but I'm really not too concerned 
 are you
 No 
 me neither
 I'm enjoying the chat
