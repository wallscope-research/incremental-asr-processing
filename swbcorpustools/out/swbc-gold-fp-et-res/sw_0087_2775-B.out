 Well it's an older home 
 It was made back in the early sixties 
 It's a pier beam house
 Got three bedrooms one bath and that just makes me scream
 I live in Houston
 Well for the neighborhood I'm in 
 yeah
 This is one of the more established neighborhoods
 The whole lot I'm sitting on is roughly half an acre
 About half of that about a quarter acre of that I've got a garden
 Well in the newer neighborhoods and development communities the houses are so close together
 if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow
 Yeah 
 And they've got better closet space
 new houses that I've seen
 It helps a bunch
 Yeah
 Most of the neighborhood I'm in is pretty typical 
 This whole neighborhood was built between sixty and sixty-five
 Everybody has got a pretty good size yard
 I got probably the biggest 
 if not the biggest yard I've got pretty close to it in the entire neighborhood
 Well I enjoy that though
 It's rained 
 No 
 we can 
 after you go to somewhere between five and ten minutes they'll get a little master recording on this 
 Yeah 
 This entire neighborhood everybody keeps the places up real nice
 Wow 
 Living in the city has some advantages
 If given the choice I'm getting out
 That's just something I'll never adapt to 
 I don't want to be a part of the rat race 
 I want to be basically just kind of left alone
 If I want to sit around and mess with my garden I'll mess with my garden
 if I want to work in the flower beds 
 Very much 
 Huh-uh 
 landscaping is more than the gardening
 in the garden I've got my beans peas
 I've got some onions out tomatoes 
 I'm not real sure what they're going to do this year
 my favorite one is putting on the tomato plant dust
 and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time
 Well I've done some rewiring on it
 Eventually if we stay here I'm going to have to rewire the entire house
 I've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on
 Not even a half bath
 The only thing that saves it with the schedule I work and the schedule my wife works we're getting ready to go to work at totally different times So that It's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning
 It doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on 
 and you're both fighting over the mirror
 I've got one
 We'll 
 he's nine months old
 He likes to dig around a little bit 
 His mother comes in and says why did you let him play in the dirt
 I guess he's enjoying himself
 He was eating the dirt 
 I wouldn't worry about it
 Well that's what I've always 
 I was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people
 After we got married we ended up moving to the Houston area
 Yeah
