 <> Hi 
 as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend I took on a painting project in my bathroom 
 and I had wallpaper up 
 I had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that 
 and it took me all weekend 
 because the wallpaper getting it off I had to wet the walls down 
 and that had to dry 
 And then the spackling had to dry a day 
 and then the painting took another day
 No 
 I just painted
 no 
 Actually the wall behind the paper was smooth 
 so I just used like a semigloss
 And 
 Well no 
 not really 
 I need to 
 it looks so bad you can see where those spackling marks were
 I need to either paper back over it or do something 
 Yeah 
 It covered the spots pretty good 
 but it just didn't look as smooth as I wanted it to
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Was it like a primer
 Yeah
 my goodness 
 that's an awful lot
 Not inside 
 Now when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it 
 That was one of the requirements from you know F H A that the house be painted before we bought it 
 and it was fairly reasonable 
 We have a brick house 
 but all the trim around the house was 
 if I remember right it was like five hundred dollars 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 so that wasn't too bad
 No 
 I haven't
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 so they did do a good job
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 As a matter of fact what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a blue 
 and the blue even two years later or so it doesn't match you know
 it's the very same type of paint and everything 
 So
 I have no idea 
 I repainted the whole thing
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 White 
 yeah 
 That's what we're trying to get ours to look like
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I see
 She painted the insides dark blue and then the trim what color 
 Okay
 White
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well what about the lighting 
 Did it make a big difference
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So that 
 you get some 
 the color doesn't really matter because you have that light
 I see 
 Uh-huh
 And it takes a long time
 Yeah 
 Really 
 no kidding
 It is 
 A lot of work 
 a lot of work
 Nice talking to you
 Bye <>
