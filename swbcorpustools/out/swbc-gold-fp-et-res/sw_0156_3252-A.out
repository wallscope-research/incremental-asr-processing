 Sure 
 I have a Springer Spaniel 
 and her name is Thumper 
 She's about seven or eight years old 
 I got her for Christmas from my family back when we lived in Nebraska 
 I like to hunt 
 and so I thought that if I had a good hunting dog like Thumper that I could just go out and get all kinds of game 
 Yeah 
 except we live in Plano Texas now
 so 
 Do you have a pet now
 
 What kind of cat is it
 Uh-huh
 Being born outside you didn't have any problems house training him
 That's good
 Sure
 And older 
 Well we went to a cat show at the Plano Center here in town 
 and we thought that we have a cat now 
 but we thought Well if we ever get another cat you know we'd want something kind of unique 
 so we kind of looked around 
 and they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian cats 
 and we sort of fell in love with the Maine Coon cats
 They're huge
 Oh
 I'll be darned 
 I didn't know that
 Well that's interesting
 We kind of like 
 well my family didn't necessarily like them as much as I did 
 but the Manx is that the one that doesn't have a tail
 it sort of has a bob tail 
 I kind of like that too 
 but 
 Well I'll tell you an interesting story about how I got my dog 
 and then I suppose our five minutes will be up
 I work for a university 
 and I went to Omaha Nebraska to recruit students 
 and I had some time off in the afternoon 
 so I went to a pet shop 
 and I saw these little Springer Spaniels
 and so I decided well you know this would really be a nice dog to have 
 so when I got back home to Carney Nebraska I told my wife about it 
 and I said You know this is just a 
 I can just hear the dog crying for me now 
 And Christmas is coming up hint hint 
 and so I had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university
 and one of the people that we went with they were friends of ours 
 and so we got to Omaha 
 and I decided I'd take my friend over and show him the dog 
 and so I got over there 
 and she said that's too bad the dog has already been sold 
 And I didn't realize it 
 but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog
 and she was in the back room 
 and so that night we had a reception for some of the potential high school students or college students 
 and he had the dog the whole time in his room 
 and I had no idea 
 And so we headed back to Carney that night 
 and the dog rode in the car 
 and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat 
 and they left the dog in the car 
 and I guess while we were inside eating Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car 
 and finally we made it back to to Carney 
 and
