 Well how do you feel about it
 No 
 the only people I know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries 
 and that's only because I went to Baylor 
 and a lot of students from Baylor go and serve as missionaries during the summer 
 But I think that's a terrible idea 
 That's like forcing someone to donate to a charity
 and it's nice to try to teach young people some civil consciousness but forcing them to donate basically their time and efforts
 You have to
 I don't either
 I don't either 
 I almost hung up because I thought well gosh I don't really have an opinion except for no 
 I think that's dumb
 But 
 I've been here for just well almost four years
 And I lived with Dana in school
 That's how we know each other
 Uh-huh 
 last weekend We went to Six Flags Saturday
 Had a good old time
 Well back to the topic at hand 
 What other types of community service would they be talking about 
 the recording mentioned the Peace Corps
 Yeah
 I'm all for donating my time to worthy causes 
 like I do some volunteer work here and there 
 and every once in a while I'll do a local Big Brother Big Sister thing
 Or I'll go you know do a 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life to go do something
 No kidding
 I have this thing against bugs too 
 And seems to me like the Peace Corps 
 they send you someplace that there's a lot of bugs 
 Yeah 
 have to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything 
 I'd probably catch a terrible disease and die
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I don't know either 
 Growing up all I knew was you go to high school you know you work you go to college you get out of college and you get a good job and you work 
 and none of this you go spend two years in the Peace Corps to broaden your horizons
 Uh-huh
 
 
 Kind of like joining the military
 Well in that respect a lot of people join the military to grow up and to decide what they want to do 
 and the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful as that kind of a time
 Uh-huh
 I'd probably have a different perspective if I actually knew someone that had gone into the Peace Corps
 But I don't
 and none of my 
 that's okay 
 and none of my really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything 
 So I don't really know anyone first hand that's committed a chunk of their life to do service work
 Everybody I know has been 
 well I'm going to go get a good job and make some money and buy a nice car 
 So 
 Yeah
 I certainly didn't mark off anything to get this one 
 I can't imagine 
 and the switchboard's been down for several days 
 and the last time I called it before it went down I had this topic 
 and I didn't feel like talking about it 
 so I hung up 
 and I guess they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it
 Yeah
 I know
 probably five or six
 Not a whole lot
 Yeah 
 Did Dana sign you up for this
 Yeah 
 that's 
 she stuck my name on some list 
 so they mailed me the information that I filled out 
 I've talked about camping with someone 
 I've talked about the weather
 That one was interesting because I talked to a man in Washington D C 
 and it was hot here 
 and it was snowing there 
 So that was pretty interesting
 And I talked to someone about the education system 
 I forget exactly what the focus was on that one 
 But that was fairly interesting 
 And I talked to somebody about credit card usage
 And I talked to this person who I gathered from speaking to her that she and her family just didn't have much 
 and they didn't have much credit available to them
 And so she basically didn't use credit cards and didn't know very much about them and how they work and how you can use them to your advantage and how you know you can do certain things with them 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well that's always a good plan 
 I can't think of anything else that I've talked about 
 most of the ones on the list I checked off stuff like football [ and + and stuff that I would enjoy talking about 
 and I haven't gotten a one of them yet when I've called
 how funny
 Uh-huh
 I had to talk to someone about hobbies 
 and the switchboard called me 
 so I was caught a little off guard 
 and I couldn't think of anything at all 
 So I started making stuff up 
 I told this woman that my hobby was gardening 
 and I can't even grow an ivy 
 My grandfather gave me a plant once 
 and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill 
 you could freeze it 
 you could dry it out 
 no matter what you couldn't kill it 
 Well I killed it pretty quick
