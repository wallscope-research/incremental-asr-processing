 Okay 
 let's see 
 I believe in the trial by jury 
 I think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for payoffs you know briberies unfairness one-sidedness you know all those kinds of things 
 And I also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody 
 I really agree with the innocent until proven guilty theory 
 I think that's a good way to do it 
 That's about all
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Really
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 that's a good idea 
 Maybe this pre group of people could decide you know you know where they could go from there 
 Do they need a big lengthy twelve person jury 
 or do they need a six person jury or you know those kinds of things 
 and the degree of you know the seriousness of it you know 
 how 
 is this open and shut you know like you were saying 
 or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened You know a jury like that
 They could be a good idea to 
 that could work
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Good idea
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 right 
 that's 
 Right 
 that's a good idea 
 I 
 in the BIBLE it says if you have something against somebody to go to them first 
 and if that doesn't work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them 
 and if that doesn't work to take it to the whole church 
 So that's right off that same kind of principle
 that's a good idea
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 that's true too 
 But you know that whole Biblical concept like <> that's true in a lot of our 
 you know the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that 
 It doesn't work on that 
 but it's based out of that 
 so you know that could work
 what is that called 
 The Judeo-Christian ethic 
 Judeo-Christian ethic
 Yeah
 Right
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's 
 Really
 Really
