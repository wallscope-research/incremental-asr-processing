 some
 Yeah 
 I think it didn't really take over the first page quite as much as it did I think during the war
 But we definitely need something there with all the hostages and what all
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 well you know I just see this Middle East situation with Russia and everything there that's happened I think that that crisis has kind of slowed down 
 and I see the Middle East as being you know the real hot spot of the future so to speak
 So I guess I view it as being the prime importance as far as trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I guess the question in my mind somewhat 
 and it depends on the country you know 
 I think some are more peaceful than others
 If you look at Iraq for example and you know the recent thing with the U N going in there and the bomb development and all this kind of stuff you know 
 Gosh 
 I think you know we should have got him while we could or whatever
 And I think there's a certain mentality to that's in the Middle East you know the constant fighting you know 
 and 
 Yeah 
 I think they look at force as a way of you know their means to their ends
 so you know I don't know so much if these peace talks are going to 
 I don't know how much they'll stay to them
 You know even if we say that we're going to do stuff I don't know how they'll stick to that 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's probably a bonus on our part
 Yes 
 it is
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I tend to agree with you
 You know I think they have in mind what they want to do 
 and I think a lot of times their might make right 
 And you know it 
 kind of the forceful you know 
 I don't know 
 But I just don't think peace is uppermost in their minds 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
