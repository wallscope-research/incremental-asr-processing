 Do you 
 Why
 You think the problem is not enough doctors
 Gosh 
 I really have a different point of view on this Well because I'm a nurse for one thing
 yeah 
 I don't think there is a shortage of doctors 
 and I do know that O B which is my field the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year that deliver babies 
 Now they can't doing anything about that 
 I don't think they're in a conspiracy 
 I think it's our fault because we as people just sue them
 People are very sue conscious
 Yeah
 Well that's probably true too
 But people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days
 And so 
 No
 Right
 That's right
 Well 
 It depends
 Well that's true 
 they are because doctors are performing many more tests
 Many of them are unnecessary 
 they are doing so many C sections just to prevent 
 Because they have all these monitors now 
 and if anything looks even a little bit funny their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby 
 and so it's costing more all around in health insurance for tests for surgery for longer hospital stay
 So it's terrible
 Uh-huh
 You'll get it
 That's true
 In fact you'll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there too
 And we have that happen 
 We have patients that go through Parkland through the clinic 
 and at the last minute they come to us 
 Well we can't turn them away 
 So 
 Yeah
 I'm for that 
 I've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer 
 so I'd like to wipe them all out 
 He better not be mine 
 Yeah 
 some they do 
 They stop their O B at least
 Right
 Right
 That's incredible
 Yeah 
 And most of them are very sincere 
 Most of them do the best they can 
 They are human
 Occasionally something will go wrong
 Well you can be human and Catholic
 Yeah 
 no
 most of them do 
 I really believe that 
 From dealing with doctors dealing with lawyers there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious
 Yeah 
 they are
