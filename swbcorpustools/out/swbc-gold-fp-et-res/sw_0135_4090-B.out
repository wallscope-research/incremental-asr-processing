 yes I am to both questions
 yeah 
 we do 
 We 
 basically there's you know the expenses that are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every month 
 and we enter those into a spread sheet 
 and whatever is left after that you know we sit down and agree on kind of what sort of range we are generally going to shoot for
 So what do you do
 Uh-huh
 Wow 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 All allocated out 
 Yeah
 All the checks 
 yeah
 Right 
 Yeah 
 we found that it's definitely helped get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses
 before we started doing that kind of a thing we were spending money for things that you know 
 we kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have
 and it was easy to let things get out of hand 
 We thought it to be really helpful 
 We have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that 
 so 
 Yeah 
 That's a lot of money 
 but 
 Yeah
 But 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 the other thing that we've found that helps is you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit
 it's just to get up the money in advance and put it in so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or whatever Just put it in an envelope or whatever 
 and that way it kind of forced us to stick to that amount *[[ Should end with a slash This is an independent clause as is B's next turn ]] And then [ once that was gone + well *[[ should be start of a new slash unit--see B58 utt2 ]] if the entertainment amount was gone ] for the month say it's gone 
 So 
 we haven't 
 our initial goal was just to completely retire debt for car payments and credit card debt and all of that 
 We are just at a point where we could start thinking about it 
 so 
 Yeah 
 Well I <> 
 Uh-huh
 A student
 Yeah 
 I am actually in the mas-
