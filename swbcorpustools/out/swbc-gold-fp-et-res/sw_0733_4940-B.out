 Okay Carol 
 So air quality
 Uh-huh
 Surely 
 You mean they don't have the smog alerts
 Right 
 yeah I spent a summer in Tyler so I know just east of Dallas there
 really 
 Yeah 
 Actually I'm a California born person
 I was born in L A 
 so I know what you're talking about 
 In L A it's pretty bad 
 the worst city in the world is actually Mexico City
 Yes
 The worst one for smog is Mexico City
 The most polluted city in the world 
 Yeah 
 I know that they're looking at you know you know better running automobiles
 some things they do one of them is they're using corn in fuel
 You ever heard of that
 Yeah 
 Methanol
 Yeah 
 Well that's big up here because they grow a lot of corn 
 that's one thing that they do/
 At that it's pretty easy to do
 And the 
 unfortunately it still contributes to global warming cause you have to you know wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that 
 It doesn't make sense 
 but it's you know 
 one of the most productive crop in the world is corn
 Yeah
 Drive cars with catalytic converters and all that 
 It's interesting 
 they're looking at 
 there's some work being done on automobiles that are electrical powered 
 And they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically 
 but it has a engine in the back that charges it 
 So the engine kicks on when the batteries need power 
 and it turns off
 Interesting thing about about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light you're not using any energy 
 Unlike a car where it's running
 A electric car it's on demand 
 it's either on or off
 Basically
 You don't have to shift 
 So you 
 cars become very simple all of a sudden too
 Very interesting
 Yeah
 [ there's a race in Australia with solar powered cars
 And Ford and General Motors and all those compete 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 <> G M Chrysler announced that they're going to they're 
 well they actually have an electric minivan
 Yeah 
 their Caravan
 But it costs fifty thousand dollars right now 
 To operate yeah 
 But you know people are buying them 
 You know whose buying them 
 *[["whose" = who's"]] The power company
 you know free for them 
 Kind of interesting so see 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour 
 So it's a good good vehicle
 Uh-huh 
 I wasn't there too long ago 
 Well you know going over the hills you know coming into the valley 
 You can see that horrible horrible brown haze
