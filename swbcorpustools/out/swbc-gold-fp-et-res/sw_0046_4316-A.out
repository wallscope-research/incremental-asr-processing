 Do you think that there's any way that 
 or do you think there's too much crime now 
 I guess any crime is too much 
 but It's out of control
 Really
 okay I would not have guessed that in Seattle
 Yeah
 You know
 Yeah 
 I wonder what really is the answer 
 it seems like the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system
 Yeah
 but the problem is that we only have but so much room 
 and we try to put aside in the warehouse 
 and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes 
 and 
 So it's 
 I get the feeling that a lot of people have 
 I'm not convinced that I have
 see my mom taught English as a second language 
 and she was dealing mostly with people that were in on drug crimes 
 and 
 Yes
 in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia
 And the problem she had was not with the inmates at all 
 the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison
 it was 
 they put her 
 obviously I didn't see the classroom and hopefully never will 
 but they put her at the end of a hallway 
 there were no other classes going on at the time 
 and they refused to let her wear a body alarm Which 
 and 
 I don't know exactly what that is 
 but I just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and really annoy a lot of people
 But you know 
 No 
 she didn't 
 She didn't 
 she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates 
 and then later on the administration kept getting worse 
 and she got a couple of inmates that she didn't feel quite as comfortable around
 But well when we came back to the States she decided that it was too 
 she didn't feel that public schools were safe 
 so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison
 But 
 Yeah 
 but the point was that it you know 
 you said that perhaps people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible 
 and I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people that run the system have given up on it
 
 But getting well see 
 I always have problems because I can never decide whether or not I'm supposed to be a conservative or a liberal 
 but 
 But I keep thinking that there's got to be some way that a lot of this is circumstances 
 I can't help but wonder if I grew up without a father on the streets and with like little or no money wouldn't I be in prison at this point
 I don't know
 We've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't get onto the program 
 I don't remember the gentleman's name 
 but the mayor of Baltimore is a Rhodes Scholar 
 and what he 
 Well what he wants to do is take all the money that he gets for drug enforcement and use it for drug education
 And basically just attack the problem at the demand side
 Stop trying to attack supply which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't 
 Switzerland tried the grand experiment 
 and you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park 
 and
