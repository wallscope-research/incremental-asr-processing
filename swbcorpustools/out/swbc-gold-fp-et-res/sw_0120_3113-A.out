 Okay 
 Well I guess because I work quite a bit with lawyers I'm not a lawyer that I find a lot of things are so specialized that I'm not sure 
 and I look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of the value of and worth so that they have real problems when it comes to 
 they can find guilt or innocence
 but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate that they might leave it to somebody else who has expertise in that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Because I find that 
 I've been on a few juries 
 and as a say I tend to be around civil cases because I've been an expert witness some 
 and many matters are so complicated that it's so hard to come up with the fair value or the fair sentence 
 and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is you know the range of possible values or terms or you know how heinous was the crime
 that 
 when I only do something one two or three times I'm hardly an expert on it 
 and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three
 And so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was you know worth five years or twenty-five
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well one of the others things that gets me on the juries is that often in the newspaper I tend to hear two things well that go on 
 One is you often see in the headlines the big numbers
 and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences or get changed by a judge or an Appeals Court 
 and that never makes the press 
 and so when you or I as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what's what because we see the headlines 
 and we don't have again a lot of knowledge 
 so we don't know what is really going on what is really the range of sentences or awards that are actually in the end applied
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well that's where the role of juries is restricted 
 and I'm not sure I'd want to change that aspect of it 
 one is it's restricted in the sense that juries only decide the charges that are actually brought you know
 if it's first degree rape second degree rape or whatever they only get to decide on that 
 well okay this person has been charged with first degree rape 
 and you can decide guilt or innocence on that
 such like maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees 
 The other thing that juries are restricted on and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things even in my own experiences that you usually don't get to hear all the information
 It's what information is presented 
 and I don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards 
 but often juries hear only a fraction of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and the truth that's brought out is as I say when I've heard about you know 
 the oath is to tell the truth 
 the whole truth and nothing but the truth is that they want 
 they don't want the whole truth 
 you can say 
 yeah
 The 
 because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the truth
