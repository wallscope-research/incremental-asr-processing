 Okay 
 we're going to talk about lawn and garden today
 Okay
 where do you work at 
 or do you wish to discuss that
 okay 
 Yeah 
 we're neighbors
 Okay 
 Hi <>
 Can you hang on just a minute
 Thank you <> 
 I have no idea 
 He didn't broadcast 
 Thank you 
 Uh-huh 
 I'm sorry
 Go ahead
 I do all the time 
 I do all the time 
 I get a lot of good tips from him
 I have his book too
 Uh-huh
 Not in Texas 
 <> Uh-huh
 Well no 
 I had a lawn service one year 
 and I thought phooey I'm going to do it myself because I figured up the cost 
 and I said huh-uh 
 I can do it much cheaper and better 
 And so what I did I switched to liquid 
 and I do it with an applicator with my hose 
 and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over the territory
 I was surprised how easy it was
 And I thought well I'm going to do this all the time
 So I found you know 
 and I've got some problems with two trees in my front yard 
 and I took them to a certified nurseryman the other day
 and do you know what he told me I needed to do
 Which is 
 a- 
 it's just unreal 
 He said I needed to pull every leave off the tree 
 and the tree is fifteen feet high 
 and it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it 
 and he told me I needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he said I should purchase
 And I thought uh-huh this is unreal 
 this is unreal 
 So I think I'll get my son-in-law to do that for me if he will
 Yes 
 it's a disease that it's got 
 and I don't know what happened to it 
 and then it 
 Well one is a maple 
 one is a maple 
 but I would much prefer 
 I think it's not a native Texan tree
 And the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property 
 and they don't get any care
 and they're cedar elm 
 and they're just beautiful
 So it's you know these things that you pamper 
 some people have really a green thumb 
 you know and although I don't have too serious a problem 
 but I don't know if it was from the late freezes that were or the early freezes we had that caused this tree damage 
 and you know Sperry said you know that's what happened to the Crepe Myrtles the last two years that we are looking at all the freeze damage from the prior two years
 So I kind of think that maybe that happened to these large trees that I have
 And I really hate to lose them 
 but that's one of the hazards I guess of having a yard
 Because I 
 Uh-huh 
 <> Right 
 the quick growing 
 yeah 
 and he 
 uh-huh 
 Can I pick your brain about how you got rid of those trees 
 Did 
 are they still there 
 did you cut them down at the ground level 
 or did you pull them up by the roots 
 or how did you get rid of them 
 Because I 
 I don't know how to get rid of these big trees because one has a circumference of about ten inches 
 and 
 Oh
 
 Uh-huh
 Because I don't want stubs in my lawn 
 Because you still have to 
 Uh-huh 
 The base 
 To the ground 
 Uh-huh
 Bore 
 I see tr- 
 a stump killer
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and they get that saw 
 and I think it's some kind of a screwing thing that just rips it right out 
 Right out 
 yeah
 Used those for mulch 
 sure 
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 A blessing in disguise
 two fold purpose 
 Yeah
 Lawn 
 Yes 
 Uh-huh 
 Yes 
 I have a self-propelled Snapper
 Because I'm sitting on a hill 
 and it's very difficult to address
 Well that's good 
 They're very expensive
 <> booey 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 they always try to give you a song and dance
