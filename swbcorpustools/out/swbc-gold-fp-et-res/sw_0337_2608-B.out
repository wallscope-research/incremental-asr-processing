 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh

 Uh-huh
 Sure 
 And it's not much work
 That sounds 
 Yeah 
 real- 
 I bet it tastes good too
 yeah 
 Now how many could you serve
 Yeah 
 okay 
 I figured about that
 that's good 
 See out here we have so many ethnic people 
 We have Italians 
 and we have Portuguese 
 and we have Russians and Polish 
 And it depends out here like the type of people you're going to entertain you know
 So it's hard 
 you just have to pick something for the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time
 And they're big on finger food here too You know chicken wings and ribs and that kind of stuff barbecue and cooking out in the yard you know when it's nice Barbecue outside chicken and that kind of stuff
 no 
 but I have had shrimp
 of course
 That's 
 Yeah
 Really
 Is it like shrimp
 It's similar
 Ch- 
 it does 
 Does it look like a lobster
 it looks more like a crab
 Oh
 Are they thin long or wide
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 Yep
 Oh 
 and where did you say you were from
 Louisiana 
 well do you do cajun cooking
 I love blackened you know the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff
 We have a few places up here that do that
 And if ever I see it on the menu I always get it
 It is so good 
 Now how do they do the blackened
 But do you have to have a certain skillet or something
 No
 I did have 
 I don't have it now 
 But I have mostly Teflon
 You now 
 but 
 does it have to get extremely hot
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I see
 Yeah
 I see
 Oh
 really
 Oh 
 Now you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time
 Is that what you're saying
 uh-huh 
 Because I could have the chicken on the skewers with blackened seasoning
 And that is so good Delicious
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 It is 
 I love it
 in fact I was in Texas for a little while
 And I liked the barbecues and the Mexican food
 I have a passion for all that type of different tastes 
 Because I have been brought up mostly Italian American food 
 Because my parents are Italian and Portuguese 
 So we cook a lot of pasta and gravies and pizzas and you know roasts and that kind of thing
 That's why I enjoy going to restaurants and you know trying different things
 I would love to
 I 
 Really
 Uh-huh
 Is that right
 Uh-huh
 Now where do you go when you go there right on Basin Street and those places
 Uh-huh

 And it looks delicious
