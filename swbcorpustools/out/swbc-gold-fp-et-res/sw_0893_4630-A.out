 I basically listen to the news from the T V 
 That's probably the only time I get a chance to take a look at it is the evening news 
 and then if I'm lucky I might be able to hear something through news wise 
 But other than that that's probably how I get my source unless something really tragic happens and somebody tells me it about you know through conversation or whatever 
 but most of the time it is through the news in the evening 
 so that's about the 
 Newspapers 
 No 
 I'm not too much in reading newspapers 
 not that I don't enjoy newspapers or anything like that 
 but part of it is because I just don't feel like I need to have them with watching the T V or whatever 
 We get our weekly news around the area 
 and I might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state 
 But the majority of the time now I don't get a daily newspaper where you know I get tons of news coming in that kind of stuff
 you do 
 You read it in the morning then
 Uh-huh
 Sure 
 sure 
 To see if they did it or if they criticize you or put something in there wrong 
 Sure 
 sure 
 Uh-huh 
 Sure 
 Sure 
 exactly 
 Uh-huh 
 sure
 Well that's kind of like you said then 
 we are kind of on the opposite where I get home and while I'm cooking supper the T V is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on 
 and very seldom do I catch the ten o'clock 
 so by that time you know old news is probably what I hear through the grapevine or whatever 
 But unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then I think everybody was glued to the T V to find out what was going on
 But other than that no 
 It's 
 Exactly 
 exactly 
 exactly 
 sure
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well it brought kind of more of a vivid look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things 
 But yeah 
 that's true 
 You know <> you know a lot of people that read the newspapers to get the news of what's going on 
 and other people that you know do it differently or don't even watch any news at all 
 But 
 Exactly happens 
 Sure 
 sure 
 That's 
 sure 
 a clip you know a sentence or two 
 and that's about it of what went on 
 and they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time 
 Sure
 Makes sense
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 So you're right on the coast line 
 You're not further up 
 You're 
 Uh-huh 
 Sure
 Sure 
 I suppose you watch for hurricanes coming in and things like that 
 Sure 
 Yeah 
 that's about the only time in the summer if you're watching T V for the weather even though it's very hard to predict what's going on 
 they'll kind of say well there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever 
 This is what is expected 
 but a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically so fast you know where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 to take off 
 Sure 
 Yeah 
 That's 
 sounds pretty good 
 so Anyway I don't know if our time is getting up here 
 or it's got to be fairly close to that
