 Okay 
 in order to make the curried chicken I just fried the chicken until it was nice and brown you know 
 make sure it's nice and brown on both sides 
 and then you take it out of the fat 
 and you let the chicken you fried kind of drain so that a lot of the oil comes out of it 
 And then you pour all of the oil out of the pan 
 and you kind of clean it out 
 and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some bell peppers and onions in that little bit of oil 
 Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons let that brown then put all of the chicken back in there 
 And then you mix flour and a cup of water maybe one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water 
 Stir it real real well
 Then you pour that in there you know to make the gravy 
 And you let it come to a boil again 
 and then you let it simmer 
 and you add about a tablespoon of what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder
 And it's going to be really good 
 Yeah 
 it's 
 Right 
 and then if you like it really hot you can add some hot hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff
 Yeah
 well it will be in a little while 
 I'm trying to get it ready early

 That sounds real good except the squash 
 I just don't like squash
 I never did 
 My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash 
 and she'd have squash and corn bread 
 And maybe she'd have chicken or something
 And I'd just be 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 that sounds good 
 we were from North Carolina 
 and we had a garden 
 and my mother would grow the squash 
 and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of 
 Right
 Wow
 You wouldn't believe it we even raised chickens 
 You ever seen anybody kill a chicken
 And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off
 And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub 
 and finally it dies down 
 you get just a little patter 
 and then it 
 Getting ready to eat chicken too
 Uh-huh
 Well that's good 
 A lot of people are eating healthier now a days
