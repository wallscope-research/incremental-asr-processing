 Okay 
 would you like to begin or would you like me to start
 Okay
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I agree
 Right
 Right
 I agree with that 
 I think you do see more and more women out there in politics too as mayors or you know in helping to maybe get some legislation passed to have women have more rights 
 I think still even with that whole thing with Judge Thomas you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man 
 or something the way they had the trial 
 and I just think that it's still going to take another generation or so before before the women could really feel that they're really equal in the business world and that they work just as hard or harder 
 but it's still 
 going from homemakers into corporate leaders is still a big step
 Right
 Yes
 I think it's true 
 I think also people are having children at a older age
 so it's maybe like you know 
 you go through college 
 and then you maybe work for a few years 
 and then you have your first child 
 and [ you know you know ] both sides of the coin 
 You know what it's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly and to take care of the kids 
 and then maybe people that are just working and think you just stay at home 
 But then when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid it's like they lose it 
 They say wow 
 This is harder than I thought 
 Well you know 
 I know it 
 I know
 Uh-huh
 Are so involved 
 Yes
 Right 
 right
 Their role has to change to kind of accommodate us too 
 I know 
 I have three children 
 and my oldest is eleven 
 and I've pretty much been home since Brian was born 
 and just recently I went back to work last school semester to tutor high school age students with learning disabilities 
 and I was just out of the house two days a week
 but I thought wow this is really hard 
 only 
 and it was only two days 
 and I was home before three
 But getting the baby to day care getting the kids off to school I still did everything I always do you know 
 my husband still got up and went to work
 but it 
 only those two 
 it made a big difference 
 I thought wow full time 
 I don't think I could swing that personally
 Oh
 boy
 Pick up Dinner 
 Right
 I bet 
 I bet
 Well I know a lot of people 
 I know I had my first child when I was twenty-five 
 and that's not considered really young these days 
 that's almost you know 
 but I have friends that have kids just starting kindergarten 
 and they're forty years old 
 and then like maybe a two year old at home 
 and I think boy I'm in my thirt-
