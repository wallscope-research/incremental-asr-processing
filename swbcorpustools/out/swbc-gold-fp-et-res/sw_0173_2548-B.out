 What kind of a car do you drive now
 Do you 
 I drive a Honda Accord
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 me either 
 I just bought mine 
 it will be a year in August
 I love it though 
 I love Hondas
 I think I found my car
 Right
 really
 I have a standard
 really
 I hadn't heard that
 What did you have before you bought that
 Did you
 I had a Mazda R X Seven before that 
 and that was the worse car I've ever driven in my life
 Really
 Really
 Yeah
 Right
 I really never had anything major with my Mazda 
 but it was a standard also 
 and the clutch went out on it toward the end
 I had it five years 
 and the last two years it seemed to go out really easily 
 I think it went out twice in two years 
 and that's a lot 
 it shouldn't go out that much
 And so I went ahead and bought another standard when I bought the Honda 
 but I don't think I'm going to do that again
 I think I'm going back to automatic now
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 it is
 That's true
 Yeah 
 it is me too 
 that's why I got the Honda
 Hondas have great resale value
 The Mazda definitely did not 
 Not at all 
 They're worse than American cars I think or just as bad as far as resale goes
 Yeah
 Right
 Good
 Right
 Yeah 
 That's what I did with the Mazda drive it until the clutch went out and the wheels fell off
 so probably what I'll do again 
 But I really like the Hondas 
 I like foreign cars a lot
 I looked at the Mitsubishi Galant 
 I was looking for a four door car having driven the R X Seven so long
 and it was so small 
 and it's really impractical 
 So I wanted something with a real trunk and four doors something easy to get in and out of 
 and I looked at the Galant 
 and those were really nice 
 and I can get them for a great price
 But I found it hard to deal with the dealership I was going through
 So that's how I ended up with a Honda
 Right
 yeah
 They're nice I think
 yeah
 yeah 
 I have to have them loaded
 I love all those little things that you don't need 
 but they're so wonderful
 I understand
 Yeah 
 I noticed 
 Mine was definitely not impulse 
 I really needed a new car 
 Mine was just it was getting worn out I guess from being a sports car 
 I drove it kind of hard
 and I got it right after high school 
 So by the time I traded it in it was ready
 Ready to go
 *[[ I really think this should be a continuation of B101 utt 2 ]] Did you
 Right
 Right 
 That's the same with me 
 Would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself
 Like 
 Right
 I was going to buy one once 
 but I worry about who's driven them and what they've been through and the warranties and things like that
 Just I can't seem to get over that 
 That just bothers me 
 I don't know why
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Hoping that they do go to a Honda dealership to get them serviced
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's true
 Well I guess that's all
 I enjoyed talking to you
 Bye-bye
