 Uh the causes of crime 
 Um I think it was imbalance of power in the United States 
 It's causing the lower class to rebel 
 That's why there's su- such high crime 
 and uh there's crime in uh young people because they don't have ro- role models
 see too much crime on T V 
 and they think it's the way to go 
 I don't know 
 What do you think
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Okay
 Yeah
 Okay
 Yeah
 From anybody else
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think I can agree with that too
 
 That's true 
 You got to kind of make people want to do the right thing
 I don't know how you do that
 Yeah 
 Well I've heard this one theory that if that if a kid commits a crime that uh instead of the prosecuting the kid they prosecute the parent 
 Or both of them
 Now to put the blame on the parent
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Um
 No 
 I didn't see it
 I understand
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 What about with adults 
 Anything do any about adult crime
 Yeah 
 Well for one a major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I mean seriously
 they ought to put those people to work
 Yeah
 Um
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well
 Yeah 
 they you still have to punish them
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's 
 Yeah 
 and they're they're still they can provide for society 
 whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society
 Yeah 
 that's true
 No 
 I don't think so either 
 Uh 
 Yeah
 And they keep taking more money from us
 and people are get 
 and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just going to take fifty percent of it
 Might as well steal 
 then they don't have to pay taxes on it 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 They'd have a 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Um
 Yeah
 I don't know 
 I'm not counting on it
 Yeah
 Um
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I'm in Raleigh North Carolina
 Well where are you from
 Okay
 Oh man
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Ow
 Why did they do in the freezer
 Yeah
 Um 
 Um 
 That's awful 
 Yeah 
 we still get some in Raleigh 
 I mean not not too often real bad ones 
 but 
 I don't think there's anywhere where there isn't going to be crimes
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Um
 He's probably a drug dealer himself 
 You never know
 Wow
