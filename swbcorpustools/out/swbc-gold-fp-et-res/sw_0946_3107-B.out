 Boy I don't know 
 that's a tough one 
 and I suppose it's changes as my perception changes of what I'm getting gypped on 
 and 
 this month well there's a couple of changes to our health plan 
 and I guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance 
 but If I step back I'm not sure I'd say that 
 what about you
 okay
 Yes 
 okay
 but on the other hand one of these days you'll be out looking for a 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right 
 okay
 and yeah 
 and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars a semester you never use because you just use your wife's
 yeah 
 that's a negative about where I am in that well I worked five years civil service 
 and there they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that or hours per pay period or something 
 but anyway it works out as I remember basically to 
 you start at two and a half weeks or something like that 
 and at three years it goes to four weeks I believe 
 and I've been at T I now coming up on fifteen years 
 and this year is going to go to four weeks here 
 so 
 
 Yeah 
 [ that's a + that is a negative but probably not a deciding factor 
 but 
 Yeah
 Well that 
 yeah 
 that's the thing is how flexible they are for comp time kinds of things 
 and that's the 
 yeah 
 That's why it hasn't made all that much difference is because with the civil service that you could take your vacation in increments of one hour
 but there wasn't anything as far as comp time 
 so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year you know an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing
 whereas here things are free enough that the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that much different 
 But 
 Yeah 
 I think the health insurance 
 I think that's going through changes everywhere to 
 they've gone through a couple years ago here where they will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals 
 and now they're in the process of developing a list of designated doctors 
 so that just routine visits they will compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors
 which 
 my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since he keeps real busy without having to 
 Yeah
 Well and I think in the much bigger picture than to some extent hospitals and doctors have some fixed amount 
 and if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to you know give you these rates and make this agreement then you're not covered by that 
 and the added costs get passed on to you 
 so I'm not sure 
 one of the phrases I use is that it's moving towards private socialized medicine That in terms of the negatives always heard in terms of socialized medicine you have no choice on who you go to for a doctor and things like that where it's the government that decides 
 here it's 
 Yeah 
 the effect is the same as the 
 you get left out of the loop more 
 I know that their idea is that if you have to pay a bigger share you'll be more careful about spending the money and helping hold down the costs
 but I don't know 
 in terms of the health care I find that although I've been lucky enough to never have any big problems that the cost is not a big factor 
 I want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and
