 Okay 
 where do you stand on
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I agree too 
 I 
 as far as the ban goes and everything I don't think it's possible to completely ban guns 
 There's just too many
 Right 
 and I 
 yeah 
 right 
 
 yeah 
 that's true 
 And the technology's not that hard 
 you could make a gun you know from simple you know you know 
 You know if you really wanted a gun you could make one 
 you know 
 true 
 That's true 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it's 
 yeah 
 
 yeah 
 there's no way to stop anybody from getting a gun 
 I think there should be more control as like like maybe waiting periods and things like that you know 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Sure 
 Yeah 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I know my friend is really into guns 
 and I went a couple of times with him to gun shows you know that come through town and everything 
 and they have anything you'd want 
 
 you know you know anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and there's nothing 
 You can just go buy one and take it home 
 and it's easier than getting like a video membership card at you know a video store
 yeah 
 yeah 
 You just go and buy the gun 
 and 
 No 
 Well except for the pistols and th- 
 I'm not sure how they do that 
 I know they 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah 
 I think that's 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I'm not sure 
 I'm not really sure what the gun laws in Pennsylvania are like
 No
 Uh-huh
 <> Uh-huh
 yeah 
 The skeets you mean
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah I don't think it can happen either
 I don't see 
 and then I think hadn't thought about this before 
 but if they would decide to ban guns it would just open up you know a black market for them
 And so you know they would just 
 all the profits would go to you know 
 Yeah
 th- Oh yeah 
 the owner's responsibility
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 you know that's true 
 you know I had a friend who was a policeman in a local borough just a small you know one of the small towns near Pittsburgh 
 And she said that you know he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that 
 but you know you're you know 
 people make you know 
 they forget or you know you know 
 kids get in 
 the way kids are you know they can you know 
 Right
