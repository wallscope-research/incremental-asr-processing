 Where are you from Tina
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 I have two children 
 I have a seven year old and a three year old
 so I try to spend as much time as possible with them
 Well we do a lot of things with them you know 
 Taylor my youngest is 
 or my oldest is in school 
 and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that
 was it a big change in your life to have a child
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh 
 What do you do during those days
 Well you said you worked a couple days a month though
 what do you do
 are you
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I understand that 
 yeah 
 They really grow up quick Especially at that early age
 But my wife was 
 she worked part-time when my oldest was little 
 and now she's staying home all the time 
 but that worked out really well because it's a big transition I think to have children
 You know to go from you know nothing you know 
 if you want to do something every night that's fine 
 but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore 
 so 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I agree with you 
 I think that my wife leaned that way 
 and I'm really glad she did 
 and you know I'm glad she's staying home 
 but you know I know there are some days when she wishes she was back at work
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well that's why I'm glad my wife did too 
 'cause she worked either two to three days a week 
 and that got her out of the house 
 and yet she'd get to spend you know three or four days with 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and so 
 Yeah 
 I do to 
 I agree 
 but then when you start having two of them it's you know a little bit tougher because you've got to make a little more money to make that payoff and stuff
 are you from the Maryland area
 Really
 I'm in Dallas Texas
 Yeah 
 so I've lived here like eight years or so 
 my wife's from Fort Worth
 But 
 yeah 
 I work for Texas Instruments
 Yeah 
 that explains it doesn't it
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 what's your husband do
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 yeah 
 I'm sure it does
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 what 
 my wife did some teaching at like a private tutoring place A Sylvan Learning Center this year 
 and so that got me to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff you know 'cause normally if they need something they just go to mom No matter what it is 
 I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them 
 but it's so much easier to go to mom 
 I guess they get used to it
 So 
 but you know we'd go to the library and do things like that 
 yeah 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 it really does 
 because I think you know you grow closer 
 was your husband naturally a child 
 had he been around children 
 or 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I understand
 I you know 
 it's hard because you know 
 then you're not getting to spend as much time at home 
 your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to
 So yeah 
 that's a tough situation 
 but then again you know some 
 you got to do what you got to do you know to get along too 
 so 
 Uh-huh 
 well like I said my wife normally feels that way 
 there are days when I come home and she says here take these kids 
 I'm getting out
 So she's had about enough during those days 
 But for the most part you know I've really feel like that's led 
 the way that you know we- jus- 
 like what you said with the cost of living and everything I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary and won't
 And so I think that's tended to lead to a decline in families and family values especially
 And I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that you know we need to do something about 
 but I don't know what
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 would you have said that a couple of years ago do you think
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child
 Uh-huh
 Well you know in the next year or so you'll see so many instances where you know he'll mimic something that you've done 
 and you see you know everything I'm doing he's learning from
 and you think if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care
 You know that's how they're developing their patterns 
 And I think a lot of people either don't care or don't realize it you know 
 That's 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 eventually
 Yeah 
 it's true
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 plus I think it becomes part of you too 
 you get to stay home 
 it's not just for him 
 but it's also for you because you're both kind of bonding together there too I think 
 so 
 Well it's been nice talking to you
 Okay 
 good luck
 Okay 
 good-bye
