 Okay
 Guess 
 I bet you can't guess 
 You got it
 And I want to tell you something
 They're going to go somewhere pretty shortly
 Yeah 
 I think they are because they're getting better every year
 And they got a lot 
 I don't think so
 We went to the playoffs
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 now I like them too
 They are 
 They are doing a whole bunch better 
 Who's their quarterback
 Who's their quarterback
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I like to watch them too 
 They're the 
 I like to watch almost all the football 
 but of course I watch every Saints game that I can watch
 But I think they're really going to do good because it seems like they're finally all coming together
 If they would just quit blowing it
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Really bad
 But they got so much bad publicity too 
 And I think that hurt a lot of you know people even wanting to play on their team
 Right 
 Right
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Because all the problems 
 if you think about those years that we had the losing season of how bad 
 his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs because of you know messing with young children 
 and it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other with them
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 But that Jimmy Johnson came in too though 
 and he just you know 
 when he bought the team and all it just seemed like he just decided you know this is the way it's going to be 
 and it was bad
 it really was 
 To me it was like it's going to take them quite a while to rebuild 
 because anything that Tom Landry wanted or had he was going to change it
 I mean it's 
 you know that's the way I felt about it 
 But I tell you what 
 if New Orleans ever gets a quarterback isn't nobody going to beat us 
 There ain't nobody going to beat us then 
 Because look how good we did without a quarterback this year 
 Well They had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it 
 Fourcade was for a while 
 And then I can't remember that guy's name the one that held out for the money 
 and he was across the river 
 I can't think of his name now 
 but really we didn't have a quarterback 
 That was the whole problem 
 We had one guy that couldn't throw 
 and we had one guy that couldn't run
 And it was just bedlam 
 We really didn't have a quarterback 
 It was defense won all the games
 I don't know 
 because you know they gave away a lot of their drafts For different people for you know other places 
 So I don't know 
 I hadn't heard you know whether they have a new one or not
 But 
 Uh-huh 
 Not yet 
 But I don't know whether they have one of the first you know choices of somebody
 that would be real good
 ye- 
 everybody gets in draft
 But I don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can do any good
 But 
 Right 
 But really and truly we just don't have a quarterback
 that's all there is to it 
 But the players and stuff they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too
 Because we had some 
 you remember when Archie Manning was a quarterback
 Yeah 
 Well he was good 
 But every time we'd get a real good player they'd treat him bad
 And of course we had a different coach then too 
 But they'd treat him bad 
 and then he'd leave *[[slash error]] Or either they'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies
 *[[sd]] And it was weird 
 It was like they were trying if you were good boy let's don't have you on our team you know
 But this year they had all good players except for the quarterback
 The quarterback all of them every one that they played 
 I think they played 
 I can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks 
 but all of them were bad
 they were terrible 
 They could not pitch 
 You know they couldn't even take handoffs 
 It was terrible 
 But all the other places our defense was unbelievable
 Did you get to watch any of their games 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Do you watch it every Sunday
 
 Did you ever get to watch any of the New Orleans games
 I'm a *[[slash error]] 
 *[[b]] No
 Teams in your area
 I know it 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh
 that's neat
 Yeah
 Yes
 my goodness
 No 
 Because usually it's snowing 
 Ice and rain and everything
 But I tell you what 
 if you get to watch some of these 
 now I don't know how it will be this year you know 
 but these games go right down to the wire
 It was like I was sitting on the edge of my chair you know going no no 
 And one 
 I can't remember 
 It was about 
 it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the playoffs or not 
 So we're watching the game 
 All right 
 The other team got the ball 
 and like no we got the ball back 
 That's the way it was 
 And they had to kick to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us
 So we had to sit there you know 
 and they cut the show off and started showing us another football game 
 We did not get to see the end of the game 
 You talk about people calling in
 It was wild 
 here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair you know
 and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another you know one that was going on
 Cut us off right there the last few seconds 
 The station finally you know how they'll put the little message down at the bottom Started telling everybody that they were not the ones that had cut that off that it was the national you know 
 Uh-huh 
 because it was funny 
 everybody was furious 
 I was so mad I got up and went and called you know 
 I couldn't believe that 
 But almost every game that I watched it would come right down to the end 
 we would be ahead you know 
 but then in the fourth quarter they'd let them get up there either with them or you know right ahead of them
 And it'd come right down to the end 
 and either we made it or we didn't 
 and it was something else 
 I said this is the most 
 if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the Super Bowl
 There's no question about it because everybody was playing good together except the quarterbacks 
 And the quarterbacks just didn't do anything
 Yes 
 But maybe we'll get your guy
