 what do you think the major cause of air pollution or at least in the Boston areas 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 that isn't the same in the Washington area because we don't have any major industry except for government and services 
 And the transportation situation is such that all the car pollution is absolutely awful 
 also the hub of three airports 
 in this general area there is National Dulles and then Baltimore Washington 
 And it 
 interestingly some of the information I've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from airplanes is extraordinary
 Yeah
 and that's always something that you know you don't think about
 But the 
 apparently the air pollution and the fact that it's delivered right up in high altitudes is a very significant factor
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Society has especially recently 
 you know what it's like here 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah
 We just had the 
 That's right 
 So solutions to this would be 
 I 
 you know improved 
 Well I guess to me the first thing is I wish society would get as upset about this as you do get getting people upset about animal rights
 this is so basic 
 It's human rights in the sense 
 but in terms of demanding it's just not caused 
 but demanding that we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed toward improvement of polluting vehicles and not just cars but also buses planes That something can be done I can't imagine that well 
 if we can't send people to the moon that we can't improve these things 
 Converter 
 yeah 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And that for buses 
 That's right 
 Well and also to make it economically feasible and also in buses 
 I don't know if you ever got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus
 That you know 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 but even of course in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels 
 I'm thinking of research in that direction rather than 
 we've taken the intermediate step 
 but I don't think fossil fuels are the answer
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I me- 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you don't throw the baby out with the bath water and condemning nuclear use
 Yeah 
 yeah
 But with the pollution issue fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway
 so you've got to look elsewhere
 but it is something that's a little frightening 
 and in fact well I 
 within our family we have said 
 my husband 
 I have two sons well 
 one is already in college in New England
 and the other will be going in September 
 and we just feel that when we leave this area we're going north not south
 I like the mentality north 
 and I also like the fresher air up there
 So that's the way we will be going
 so I'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how their attitudes are
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 The smog and 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 even California was notorious for its smog years ago before it even was an issue out here
 Well that's personal air pollution 
 Yes 
 yes
 Yeah 
 well I definitely advance that 
 Well listen I enjoyed speaking with you
 And let's hope there are other people that feel the same way 
 You're welcome
 Bye-bye
