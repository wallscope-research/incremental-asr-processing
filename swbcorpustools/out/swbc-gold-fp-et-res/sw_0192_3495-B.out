 Okay 
 what do you feel are some of the main problems
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 it's pretty bad here too 
 We've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff In Durham which is right next to Raleigh
 Yeah 
 that 
 Durham Raleigh and Chapel Hill is the triangle
 Right
 Yeah 
 really it's 
 and I've seen in more in Durham than I have in Raleigh or Chapel Hill 
 Chapel Hill is kind of a ritzy city or whatever 
 it's kind of 
 I'm sure there is problems with it 
 but it has a pretty low crime rate compared to Durham has probably got the worst 
 They've had like forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year
 And over half of it has been drug related
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well that 
 and the economy is so bad 
 And so many people have been laid off and stuff 
 They've done special stories on the news local news here
 We had a lot of bank robberies and lot of break ins and stuff 
 I know like a week or so ago 
 I live in a town house which is you know 
 it's a pretty nice neighborhood 
 and this lady was going to work 
 she came home and everything in her house was total gone light fixtures everything 
 And nobody thought any different 
 they just thought she was moving 
 It was a moving man pulled right up to her house broke in and stole everything she owned 
 Well yeah 
 it's pretty bad 
 I would say so for the majority in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home
 and we all know one another 
 and on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that
 It's 
 I'm probably one of the youngest people that live over here
 Most people are retired 
 or you know they're in their forties or whatever 
 and I'm in my twenties 
 so I'm out more than they are 
 but they're at home at night 
 so I really don't worry about anything
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 see that's the same thing here
 Yeah
 Yeah
