 The war
 You mean in terms of the economy 
 or 
 
 I thought we were going to talk about social changes 
 is that what 
 you're kind of directing it
 okay 
 Okay 
 well Well I think it's caused a lot of you know big difference between when people had gone to war before like compared to Vietnam 
 because I know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over 
 and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that you know and support the soldiers 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 yeah
 Yes 
 it would be like a bonus for your image or something
 Yeah 
 it 
 I'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income just drastically altered 
 We had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they just had a new baby
 and she would have had to go back to work 
 and I think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I think the biggest change that we've seen in my life or whatever lately is the economy
 and things are so tight 
 and like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years 
 and you know 
 Yeah
 Even dog licenses 
 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Going to effect too many 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 So that's the hardest thing for us 
 and we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home 
 We have a three year old and a two year old 
 and I'm trying to stay home as long as I can
 but you know every week it gets harder 
 because I could go out and be making money
 you know so that's a big stress I think you know for the social changes in our family
 
 I see
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Well i- 
 Yeah 
 you have an inside track or something
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Let's see 
 what other social changes in the past ten years 
 I guess between men and women I've seen a lot of changes in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career be mom be everything superperson 
 Yeah 
 because I know you know I really get pressure because I have a career also
 and I get a lot of pressure from you know my colleagues 
 that 
 why am I staying home You know
 whereas before that never would have happened 
 people would have said why are you going to work
 So that's kind of a difference for us 
 I think there's more pressure on my husband to be more involved with the family
 So he's 
 Yeah 
 he's gotten a lot you know 
 you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all 
 but in terms of his amount of hours at work nothing on that has lightened up
 So it's now he has the pressure too of being superdad and supercareer 
 and 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 MISTER MOM 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 That's true
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 I think there's still 
 I know that I grew up in Chicago in the sixties
 and was part 
 my family was real liberal 
 and I think there's a lot of kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society and race relations and things like that 
 and you know I think there's so much prejudice still there
 and it's kind of more covert now 
 People used to be more clear and say you know well I believe in this or I believe in that
 and now you know I think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice
 but people think we're in the nineties we're beyond all that you know 
 Yeah
 yeah
 Yeah
 But there's so many more people that are homeless 
 and 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It's real easy to get isolated in your own little community
 you know because when I was growing up in Chicago we were in a real ethnic neighborhood 
 and there were people from first generation Chinese German you know all different nationalities and everything
 And now we're kind of like in Lewisville Miss White Little suburbia you know 
 I don't even know anybody you know from any place other than Texas hardly you know
 boy
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and they think the whole world is like that
 We lived in a dorm 
 My husband and I met in graduate school at Indiana University 
 and ours was international you know co-ed dorm
 and there were twelve hundred students 
 they're graduate students from all over the world 
 And once we came here it was like 
 gosh 
 I just miss that
 because it really is exciting to be around people of different cultures and different backgrounds 
 We got invited to 
 one guy practically roasted a goat in his dorm 
 I wonder if he was from Iran or some place 
 I don't know where 
 but you know Yeah
 yeah
 uh-huh
 Oh
 Yeah
 yeah
 God
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 really 
 That is part of the change I think that I've seen probably you know in the past twenty years or whatever is now kids have to have so much 
 I even get caught up in it with our kids even though I buy most of the things at garage sales for their Christmas
 people you know think they're kids have to have five hundred dollars worth of toys
 yeah 
 it's just 
 it's 
 gosh
 Yeah 
 me too
 in Chicago I didn't even date a guy that had a car until I was in college 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 gosh
 my kids are going to be hating me
 I'll give them a bike and say here's it 
 so you can afford to pay the insurance you know 
 Yeah 
 no kidding
 Yeah
 Well did we cover everything Betty 
 Okay 
 I guess I'll get back to my laundry 
 You too 
 good luck
 Bye-bye
