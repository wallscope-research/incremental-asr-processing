 Okay
 Okay 
 CHINA CRY was basically the true story written by this lady who was a native Chinese who was raised by Christian parents
 And her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution
 Although she herself had never really accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other Christian portions of the faith repentance baptisms et cetera et cetera She had always felt a very strong leaning in this direction 
 And whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred and most churches were either banned or all the clergy and so forth were killed or imprisoned and the property confiscated she was safe because she had you know not officially joined the Christian movement
 So anyway as she grew up towards maturity her parents well 
 her dad was a doctor 
 and he was well you know rather well to do in the old regime 
 and the communist Chinese didn't like this at all 
 You know the bourgeoisie was out of style then
 Everybody was back to a commonality of one 
 And so they kept picking at him picking at her mother and finally started picking on her And getting her to you know 
 they were starting to accuse her of crimes and atrocities before the revolution and had her write her own story over and over and over 
 and the major point of the movie was that she had married this Chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court 
 Now I think I'm leaving out a portion 
 she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had gotten a job as an instructor 
 and they were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers When they decided that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre regime crimes as it were
 Being a child you know 
 So they kept on and on at her
 and in the meantime she and her husband were expecting their own child 
 And the people kept harassing her you know over a period of months 
 and finally they carried her out into the courtyard either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of shooting her you know executing her by firing squad
 And the Lord just said no 
 this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really you know 
 she's one of mine 
 she is not going to die 
 and the soldiers were blinded when they shot
 And her life was spared 
 And this frightened the commandant 
 and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp
 Well and course here's this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around
 Well she put in for going to 
 and her husband had escaped to Hong Kong 
 and then she put in to go see him 
 And over time she 
 finally through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the middle bureaucracy that they finally let her go
 And of course she had to walk 
 You know they stripped her of everything practically besides the clothes on her back 
 so she went across the border to her husband and other child that they'd already had to freedom
 And they knew that she wasn't going to come back 
 but yeah she did years later when the liberalization of China happened 
 and she was not persecuted or anything else like that
 Yes 
 it was 
 very moving too
 Well it was within ninety days
 Yeah 
 No 
 it was advertised over a period of about ninety days
 But it wasn't 
 they didn't have it in too awfully many movie houses 
 but it was in the 
 it had large press release
