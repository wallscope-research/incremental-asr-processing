 <> I know 
 it's really difficult here All because there's always something breaking 
 Car needs tires or you know something 
 we do ours more monthly than long range 
 we 
 my husband gets paid once a month
 and when he gets paid I pay all the bills/
 And out of his check they take a savings 
 and out of my check they take savings and retirement out of both checks
 So as far as extra savings we really don't have that much extra to save
 his check once a month pays all the bills 
 My check weekly buys groceries and gas and you know that kind of thing 
 and it works out real well that way 
 We don't run into a lot of problems
 but budgets are horrible
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 When the car insurance is due and you call the credit union and tell them well send me some money 
 Yeah 
 it would be nice if we didn't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings 
 but we do 
 Yeah 
 it 
 I'm just glad that it is there for car insurance medical bills whatever happens 
 But 
 I know 
 But I 
 you 
 it's just really is difficult 
 neither one of us has had a raise in a couple of years
 And of course the cost of living keeps going up so much
 Groceries are outrageous 
 and I keep saying my check does less and less
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well I know that since I do work I buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and well the frozen things for the microwave and things like that 
 And I'll stop by the deli and pick up chicken or whatever Where if I did not work I'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot better
 Yeah 
 Well y- 
 Well I'm sure you do 
 well I do not have to pay child care during the winter 
 My son's old enough that he likes to come home from school 
 But in the summer he's still young enough that I cannot leave him by himself
 So in the summer I have that extra 
 and ours is seventy dollars a week plus all activities
 and that's usually movies one day skating one day 
 Swimming one day 
 Yes 
 So you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week 
 and that's a lot of money
 But you know if they're going to be in daycare then they need to have some activities other than just being there
 Ho- 
 do you have two children
 Well they're expensive too just the outgrowing of their clothes 
 so I'm sure the budget 
 Yeah 
 And medical bill 
 Although the insurance we had was good when Thomas was younger A lot of the stuff had to be paid up front 
 and then you were reimbursed 
 So it was nice when you'd get a couple of hundred dollar check from the insurance 
 but in the meantime you had to put out the money first
 But 
 Yeah 
 it is 
 I would too
 I would advise anyone that could possibly do it to 
 Well you probably wouldn't want to do it forever 
 I don't know though <>
