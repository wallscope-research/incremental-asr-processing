 I assume you have kids <>
 well she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet
 Yeah 
 Well we have a little bit of a basis for conversation 
 I was a substitute teacher for about a year
 Yeah 
 I thought I wanted to be a teacher 
 but before I went through all of that I wanted to see how I was going to like it
 and they 
 in Alabama where I came from they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree 
 So I went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope not for me
 Yeah 
 It was 
 I just took grades one through six
 I thought I was going to be smart and get the good kids wrong
 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh <>
 Well I sometimes wonder if I didn't mess up 
 I maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can if you have to you can get mean with them
 Those little kids don't understand it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well that's a nice way of putting it
 exactly 
 And too most people don't have that option
 You know And plus it also depends on the district your in as on the 
 I've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do accept for the private ones of course we're talking about public
 I don't know 
 Back when I was going to school you just didn't get away with the things these kids get away with now
 you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and usually bending over to get five of the best
 but nowadays they can barely scold the children for something you know without getting sued
 yeah
 Well the thing that really did it for me I was subbing in a fifth grade class 
 and this kid comes to school with his lunch box 
 and inside this lunch box he's got easily I'd say two hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills
 And I asked him what are you doing with that 
 And he says "My father gave it to me" 
 And I didn't believe it for a minute
 but you know the 
 not a lot I could do about it
 Can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants
 Well I have 
 I've full- 
 I think I understood what the kid was doing he was a 
 well let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something
 But not a lot I could do about it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Because that just 
 that doesn't do a lot for them 
 it alleviates your problem 
 but it doesn't do anything for them
 I don't know 
 guns and 
 I don't know 
 it's something
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 sure 
 it's indicative across the board that we've done something wrong
 And when you see Koreans and Chinese and Japanese who are taking all the science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs 
 and you know here we are 
 we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator
 I don't know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 No
 Yeah 
 that's a great deal what law schools like 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 And I did the same sort of thing 
 they just 
 you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases 
 and then you get one examine for the whole semester
 and it's how well you can remember it all
 Yeah 
 And I found that a particularly useless way of studying
 I never did 
 I always tried to understand things not tried to memorize
 And consequently some of the very best students had excellent memories 
 but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned
 So 
 It didn't show me anything 
 A year and a half I gave it up 
 I wasn't really wa- 
 I didn't want to be a lawyer anyway just wanted the degree
 So 
 Well 
 I don't know 
 What can we do about it
 Money is not the answer
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 they're throwing more money at it now than ever before 
 and things are getting worse
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well I don't know 
 I 
 as much as I didn't like school when I was going through it from my perspective now I can see that it's a lot better than what we have now
 And I think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school
 You know it's silly that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline
 Yeah
 Exactly
 teachers are so afraid now of even saying something to students because they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something
 yeah
 Well lawyers help create that 
 <> Well I think what we've turned the school schools into now are just day-care centers
 you know somebody 
 okay 
 we're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day 
 and he's out of our hair
 And the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents
 You know they're just 
 sure 
 I 
 you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get anything at home then it's not going to help either
 So I don't know 
 I don't know 
 I don't know what the answer is
 It's an interesting thing you want to do 
 I 
 how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools 
 do they allow it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 That's interesting 
 I remembering reading a few cases about when some people first tried that and they got sued Got taken to court by the school system 
 I'm glad the parents won 
 it seems silly that we started 
 that's the way you got your education in this country
 And then
