 Okay Eric 
 are you married 
 and do you have a family
 Okay 
 and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I see 
 Well that's basically what we do 
 about every three months or so we re-evaluate our budget 
 and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest
 and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks 
 I work part time at night
 and my husband works full times days 
 and so we have four checks 
 but that works out nice because we get paid every week 
 and so that does help
 that helps a lot 
 And then we don't have a lot extra for extra spending
 so it's pretty well ear marked 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Every penny is ear marked 
 but we have found that works the best 
 and so if we can just divide all the major bills up 
 In fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half 
 and divide those up between all 
 uh-huh
 And so we are not taking a huge sum out of one 
 and then the next pay check we're real short 
 or 
 That's true
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well it helps you to focus where your money goes
 and I am sure you felt the same frustration before you got on a budget 
 but you're wondering when you put down all the money that you do bring in 
 and then you're saying my word where did all that money go 
 Where does it go
 
 and also we have found that if we write down 
 and we did this 
 We are not real consistent with this 
 but we did it for about a month 
 and we wrote down everything that we bought you know every pay check
 and so we could see where every penny went 
 and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend 
 and like I say we haven't been real consistent with it 
 It's 
 we should cause it does help
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Wel- just stick to that 
 uh-huh 
 That is 
 Yeah 
 that sounds like a really good idea
 And it really helpful 
 have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 that's good 
 That's a good feeling 
 My husband just graduated from the university a year ago
 so finally we are getting to that point too 
 So are you still going to school 
 or
