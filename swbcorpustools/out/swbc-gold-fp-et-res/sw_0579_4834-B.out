 No 
 not really 
 the only thing that annoys me is when people call and you have solicitation calls
 That's the only thing that bothers me 
 That's not really invading my privacy 
 <> do you feel that yours is invaded
 but that doesn't work
 no 
 because a lot of times they dial sequentially 
 They get your name from if you enter any type of contest or anything
 you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something 
 you put your phone number on there 
 they pass your phone number on to another company
 or you 
 or like the newspapers they just dial randomly and stuff 
 the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe 
 And while I was subscribing to the paper I got so upset at them that they 
 you call me one more time I'm going to stop subscribing 
 And the local papers ask them to remove your number from their list 
 and yeah 
 you call up during regular hours 
 they have a special department 
 they'll take your numbers out of their lists
 but the Orlando paper yeah they refused to take it off of the lists 
 and they call every month
 And when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 If you know a person's social security number and their mailing address and their mother's maiden name you can basically become that person
 if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to
 and since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove you know that it wasn't her 
 if it was some you know coming into the store and stuff then whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of you know document
 and wh- 
 the signature 
 they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature 
 and if they can't provide a signature you know they'll have to eat the charge 
 But if the pers- has you know her social security number I'd be real concerned that she's not blacklist on what is it it's Telecredit or something
 because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there 
 She probably won't be able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle
