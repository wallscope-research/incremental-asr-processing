 Boring 
 You think so
 I bought a stationary bike 
 but I find that if I sit on that seat too long it hurts
 And I haven't figured how to get that soft 
 and I tried even tying a pillow to it 
 But two years ago well it's not quite two years it's almost two years I joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano
 And I love it
 I just love it
 Yeah 
 It's totally women
 I like to be able to sweat have my hair a mess feel that okay fine if my bathing suit slips a little bit I don't have to be conscious of it being a little bit too low 
 And my bathing suit's just one piece 
 so there's no big deal all the way around 
 but I don't have to be conscious of what I'm doing or how I'm doing it 
 And it's a total free relaxation 
 Because hey you can do what you want 
 You're a female 
 and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing
 And they've got such fantastic equipment in there
 yeah
 And I love the water aerobics 
 I love the water aerobics
 yeah 
 They've got a nice one
 They have two types of water aerobics 
 They call it aqua exercise I guess is what they call it
 It pushes you because you're pushing against the water in itself 
 So it is like double strenuous 
 But you're not being double strenuous on your own body 
 Because you're pushing it yourself
 So you're doing it yourself
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh 
 The only thing that I ever felt was every time I stop and start going again because I end up getting two jobs once in a while 
 I end up having to quit for a while 
 But I get blisters on my toes on the bottom because I really jump a lot
 Well a lot of people wear those little terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom Especially around the pool 
 So they just wear them right into the pool
 Yeah 
 They're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with rubber you know soles so that you know 
 no big deal one way or the other
 But I never think about it until after you go there for about a week your toes you start getting blisters anyway 
 So no big deal
 But it's fun
 I try to make it at least three times a week
 For a while I was doing it every day Just going five days a week
 Well 
 When I was working up at The Summit here in Plano I'd leave there 
 and I'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock actually about four thirty because they start at five to six 
 so I was there by four thirty every night 
 And the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet
 Because no matter what I did or how I did it I invariably got myself wet
 But the water only comes up basically anywhere from your waist to your chest I'd say
 So it's your choice where you want to go 
 but I enjoyed it higher
 That's okay
 I have a bad back <> 
 so I'm very limited what I do 
 It's like I can walk 
 but if I walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me 
 Especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard 
 it will bother me 
 it will bother me
 Well what pushed me that way though basically was the fact that when I went in there is wasn't for the water aerobics 
 I went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles
 And she said Hey go for the swimming pool 
 She says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor 
 She says in fact you get more
 I said okay because I'm not a swimmer
 I like water 
 I'm not scared of it 
 But I couldn't 
 I guess I could swim across the pool 
 but I'm no swimmer per se
 But I found that this worked really well 
 And I came out of there 
 and I saw my stomach going down well
 I dropped I'd say almost twenty pounds Just by watching what I ate 
 And they fix you up with a diet which worked real good
 What 
 A diet
 no 
 they have nothing to do with that
 See when this one down here opened up I joined as a V I P 
 And the V I P gives you a computerized diet 
 And they go over all your health and all your history 
 and they show you everything to do and how to do it and the whole nine yards 
 So it became part of the package 
 so I went through it 
 It worked out well 
 yeah 
 You can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too
 I just went and took the because they were offering it as an opening benefit 
 so it's less than what you pay now for going in there after all this time 
 So it's like when I got laid off 
 I went back in there and start all over again because it had been a while since I'd done it
 So I get all the same treatment again 
 So it's kind of nice
 Like I said I like it 
 I like the heat 
 I like the 
 I jump out of the swimming pool 
 and I go into the hot tub
 And I love it
 Because I have never 
 let me reword that 
 I think I have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore 
 But that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did
 That's 
 I knew I was pushing too far
 But usually when I go into the hot tub before I go swimming or when I come out I'm totally relaxed when I go home 
 It's no big deal
 It's fun 
 It's fun 
 I've gotten on the bike 
 And they've got the stepping bike where you step
 And I've enjoyed that watching how well I can walk up and down stairs
 But most of the others to me are very dull
 <> I get bored very easily 
 the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit 
 Like you said you can sit and do it and watch the T V and not even really be conscious of what you are doing
 With the stepper you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down
 So you have a you know little 
 you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so to what your gear is 
 I 
 it would depend upon which one you want 
 I think now that I've had the bicycle 
 I would go to the stepper 
 But if I were you I would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while 
 Because you can buy a month's membership And see what you feel is best for you
 Because it all depends you know for everyone their own what they want to do 
 Because I jump on the bike here at home 
 Mine has see the handle bars go up and down
 so I can sit there and read and listen to music like what you said 
 and it has no effect on me 
 So it's boring
