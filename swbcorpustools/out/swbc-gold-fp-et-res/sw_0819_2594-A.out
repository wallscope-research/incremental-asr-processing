 So Jan how do they recycle in Texas
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 is it all voluntary
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah
 There's a lot of projects where the Boy Scouts and things that will collect your cans 
 and it's a good fund raiser for the kids
 Uh-huh
 I guess I 
 you see I guess it depends on your landfill space
 I know I 
 we're in Maryland 
 but my 
 I from Pennsylvania 
 *[[missing copula]] and my parents are forced recycling
 
 Yeah 
 all plastic has to go into a recycling bin all cans have to be recycled all newspapers has to be recycled Because they're just running out of space and landfills 
 Pennsylvania Ohio and New York are some of the 
 they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones
 So it's really hard on them 
 Now up here in Maryland though we're just in a voluntary recycling stage right now 
 so my wife and I you know we save our bottles 
 and we save our newspapers 
 and we save all our plastic and all of our tin cans 
 And just like you say we go to a community area where they have it set up 
 and we dump them off there
 Yeah 
 It's still voluntary though I think we're supposed to have something implemented by nineteen ninety-three though where some aspects will be mandatory 
 Uh-huh
 Mostly just the cans
 And I 
 and most of the time like I said that's a sort of like fund raiser things that the schools do or that the Boy Scouts do or whatever
 Yeah 
 Cans are the only thing I think you really get money for
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I think that's mostly 
 well you know we 
 even before 
 as soon as the community said you know We're going to put up bins for recycling you know we automatically started doing it 
 it's one of those things 
 you know and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be separated you know 
 That's 
 No 
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 how well they're doing 
 We do 
 I work in a speech interface lab at a college 
 And we do basically the same thing 
 The state of Maryland has asked all the colleges and universities and some of the large organizations you know if they would definitely recycle their office paper
 And the same thing you know almost every college in Maryland is recycling office paper 
 But you know in the giant bins around 
 and it's surprising how much you never realize because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage can every night
 You don't notice until you start leaving 
 you know they don't pick up your recycling until it's full 
 and you just can't believe how much paper that you 
 Reams of paper come out of an office every day That took us to recycle
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 So I think Hopefully if 
 you know I guess a lot of the large organizations probably T I did they advertise on television how successful they are
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Internal 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Right 
 Yeah 
 That would probably be true 
 Yeah 
 Because I know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television 
 you know they'll come up and say 
 you know they'll show you to encourage recycling 
 They'll say 
 And here those of us that Dumavra Power which is our power company that 
 we now recycle forty-five percent of our solid waste
 and they 
 and that 
 we do this for the community 
 they put those on 
 so I think you know we're probably reaching a successful stage and just with voluntary I think
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah
 I think so too 
 Yeah
 Right 
 Yeah 
 We weren't concerned 
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 Huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think really probably what hit peoples you know I know that here up in the the New Englands area and also in Pennsylvania Ohio and New York all of a sudden we're out of landfill
 and they're saying We estimate this landfill be ov- will be full in two years unless we cut back 
 And even then you know we're really running out of space 
 So I think that that became 
 that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space in some of the more crowded states
 So what 
 you know and no other state 
 I'm sure Texas probably still has some landfill space 
 They're not going to voluntarily say Hey ship your garbage here
 So you know realistically you know we have to start recycling in some geographic areas 
 It's really tough
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah 
 But well 
 Well in some ways I guess it doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it you know Because I know that like in Pennsylvania they require them to put their newspaper for recycling 
 But the de-inking process that they use to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused is very expensive
 and also it produces a liquid waste that they don't know what to do with yet
 So even some aspects of recycling they still have yeah cost efficient yet 
 Yeah 
 but others you know like tin cans and plastics are really efficient you know 
 they melt on quickly you know just because of the heating and things getting glass 
 Yeah
 So i- 
 it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I don't know either 
 That's 
 I know that though all those petroleum products though are so terrible for the water table
 You know they really pollute quickly 
 and you know one 
 I was reading some place the brake fluid normally comes in just small little pint containers That one pint of brake fluid can contaminate so many gallons of water you know like hundreds of gallons of water 
 So it's one of those things that they really 
 and you wonder you know with all these oil spills how terrible that is 
 Yeah 
 how terrible that is 
 So we'll have to keep our eyes on all that I guess
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I agree 
 Uh-huh
 I do too
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It d- Well you know if they're forced to do it it becomes sort of a habit
 You know I know that it's really funny 
 My parents are forced to do it 
 and they
