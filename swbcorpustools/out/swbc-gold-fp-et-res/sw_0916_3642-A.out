 Hi
 Well providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task 
 and personally I don't approve of it for two reasons 
 Number one is that I think that the federal government has a problem with the deficit right now 
 and if they were to administer this they would get us more and more into debt further than we can ever get out ourselves 
 Number two I think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would be dried up 
 and really no one would only answer [ to the government to a big bureaucratic mess ] 
 And I've seen what it has done in other countries 
 and so I don't think we should head in that direction 
 Although that we have problems right now 
 and I do agree that they exist 
 because health care insurance for everyone is skyrocketing 
 and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore
 How do you feel about the whole ordeal
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 yeah
 But [ [ what + 
 What you're think- ] + Yeah 
 so what you're saying ] though is instead of having the national government administer giving health insurance to every man woman and child throughout the whole company you see more of them as regulating the high costs that people are forced to pay for it right now 
 is that correct 
 or do you think that
 Well with the costs as they are right now do you think that the government 
 because what that would require is for us to pay more taxes 
 and the people that can afford taxes the middle income and the upper income will be paying more taxes to pay for health insurance for everyone whereas right now the public themselves get health insurance 
 and they provide their own health insurance
 E- 
 You think it might get better huh 
 I kind of disagree 
 The reason being is we have 
 I don't know 
 I guess it's my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic rules that it would take to administer it 
 and the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and don't allow cases where they might throw them out of business whereas the federal government if they took over everything they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business 
 People would still have to pay taxes 
 the money would have to come from somewhere 
 and so you'd s- 
 I feel that the cost would increase dramatically also 
 But in the same sense the care and the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical field would diminish
