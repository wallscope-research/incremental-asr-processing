 Okay 
 Well I think the court systems could stand some improvement 
 trial by jury is good 
 but a lot of cases is circumstantial evidence that convicts a person which I don't think is all the time good Because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness 
 And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me 
 I don't know
 I think so
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 You think you prefer the jury 
 You think your chances are better
 Well that's true
 Uh-huh
 Well sometimes the sentencing is not fair 
 even if well the jury I guess they do decide that 
 but I'm like you 
 in a case like that most of the time its 
 I don't know 
 maybe I'm too conservative when it comes to that 
 the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases you know 
 Right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh <>
 Right
 really
 Yeah 
 that's not a bad system 
 But I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit
 But the thing is too maybe they need I don't know more of a expert types to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in
 exactly
 Right 
 exactly
 Yeah
 Uh-huh putting on a act or whatever
