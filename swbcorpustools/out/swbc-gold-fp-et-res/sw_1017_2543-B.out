 Well I 
 several years ago a radio broke in my car
 and I never 
 I got out of the habit of listening to the radio 
 so I haven't been listing 
 I used to just listen to the rock stations but lately I have been going back to classical music 
 I don't really know what too many of the most popular songs are unless you know they're in the news or something 
 But so I tend to listen to some of the older songs that were popular back when I was paying attention
 And then I like some classical music and some of the pieces that have been around a while 
 I haven't paid much attention to most of the current music 
 What about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's true
 Uh-huh
 No
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I don't 
 I never liked any of the heavy metal music 
 I never really listened to it because you know I prefer to have I guess an established pattern of music to listen to
 But and I 
 back a long time ago when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty and I listened to some of it
 but I you know 
 now that there's just a million rap groups 
 and they tend to try to outdo each other with raciness I think
 so you know I'm not attracted to that at all 
 but it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was easy access 
 and so now that I do have one I just don't automatically turn it on unless there's something I'm particularly listening to 
 But you know if you go two or three years without having that 
 what I got the most exposure to 
 it really changed my life-style and kept me from just having you know easy access to current music 
 so I did like I say tend to go back to albums and cassettes and things that I already had purchased 
 But we don't have a C D yet do you
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I kind of decided to wait until it was around a while 
 It was kind of like remember when personal calculators first came out
 and they were really expensive 
 and then now you can get one for two or three dollars
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Sure 
 and also they get better quality
 w- 
 and they learn to have more features and things without making them less expensive 
 So we're kind of waiting to like now you know 
 and the price of cassettes has gone down because C Ds are so popular 
 so 
 I haven't even priced them 
 I guess they must be
 really
 That is awful 
 Uh-huh
 Take our time 
 Well I can't imagine 
 you can't record on them and so they won't be as functional as like a cassette player where if you heard something you could record it you know if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something that you'd heard or that you owned an album of 
 so C Ds won't be nearly as handy
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Enjoy it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's good
 Uh-huh
 Why we haven't either 
 but you know we like the idea of having great extra quality you know in your music and things 
 but I'm satisfied to just have what I've been used to not have to think about the great financial sacrifice that that would be to suddenly try to switch over to all C Ds or something
 But I know one thing that has colored my music choice is when we had children I really started to think about what kind of television programs I was watching and what kind of music I was listening to and activities 
 because you know I just didn't want them to be exposed to a lot of things 
 and a lot of the songs have some lyrics that I just wasn't pleased with you know 
 Uh-huh 
 so I really think we've tried to tone down our taste there to make you know our children not be exposed to so many negative things so early in life
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Yes 
 I know what you mean 
 I know my husband he plays an instrument 
 and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school
 so he has a lot of all different kinds of music 
 and he goes out of his way to play marching band music or like you say jazz or classical to the children to give them some exposure to different kinds of music
 And I think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds 
 and 
 He plays the 
 it's a euphonium 
 It's like a really small not a tuba but I th- 
 it's hard to explain 
 I never had known anyone to play one before
 But it's kind of like a small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder
 But it's a cross between a tuba and you know a horn 
 It's a brass instrument
 So he plays that and a little bit of piano 
 but he has some real fond memories of marching band and concert band type activities 
 and he thinks that would be good for the kids 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
