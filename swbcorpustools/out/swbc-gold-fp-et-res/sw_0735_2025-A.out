 All right 
 Amy how are you doing today
 All right 
 I think we know what we're going to speak about
 I tell you what I'll start off 
 How's that
 I personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminal cases that they should bring back hangings on weekends in public places 
 There is one state that does that by the way
 I want to say Oklahoma 
 I saw something the other night about it
 They don't do them real often Which is obviously the death penalty
 but I think if we quit building these Taj Mahals with the color T Vs and sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with 
 and let's just screwing up the system
 That's pathetic
 That's pathetic
 This is true
 and the way the law reads if they sentence you to life in prison then he's available for parole 
 If it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole
 So what you know 
 let's quit B Sing with the system
 Exactly
 A life for a life
 The old Charles Manson case 
 the guy just shouldn't be allowed to even live
 about the issue about sentencing by the judge 
 the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene my understanding when there's a verdict 
 and it 
 for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth today in eight to four 
 and bam bam the guy got off 
 he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay
 it kind of gets back to the second request 
 we've been asked to look at most criminal cases requiring an unanimous verdict 
 In a situation like that I'd say no 
 let's just go like a regular vote 
 Eight to four tells me that there were eight 
 there's a certain percentage of the people there with seventy percent of the people said hey they guys guilty
 Exactly
 Exactly 
 because it's not next day they have the start the trial it's X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more
 I think that if it's not a split decision go with the highest number
 and let's just get on with the program
 But as far as the sentencing by the judge I would have to vote against that since there is a jury because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision
 what are your feelings
 
 Yeah 
 I get back to Price's comment when he was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks you know from his neck of the woods
 Well give me a break you know
 Exactly 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 you're in Dallas 
 so everybody 
 I can't believe they can 
 like in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the occurrence 
 you'd have to be pretty dense
 you'd either have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to Lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer
 This is true so true
 Well this has been an interesting conversation
 So you're at the house you're not at the plant
 that's good 
 that's good 
 I thought I heard a holler there in the background
 but I wasn't sure
 goodness 
 well I'll let you get 
 I enjoyed it 
 Bye
