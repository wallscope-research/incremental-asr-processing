 Right
 Right 
 Yeah 
 I'm sort of mixed on this 
 I think that the answer may lie not in so much a national kind of medical thing that li- like England has but more of a national insurance sort of clearinghouse or whatever 
 I think that too many 
 the problem right now is that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through 
 and I think you mentioned Canada 
 I think that they have a system where the government deals with 
 you go to whoever you want but file through one particular setup 
 and that way they are able to reduce prices because you know it's all one centralized thing
 <> Uh-huh
 Right 
 I was listening on the radio the other day 
 and they were talking that something like this 
 I think they were talking about the fact that the money that could be saved in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider could 
 they could make it provide health insurance to people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save
 <> 
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 H M O
 <> Yeah 
 and they're fairly expensive 
 I was on an H M O up until last year through work 
 And it was 
 I forget how much I paid a month 
 but it you know is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care
 And the reason I quite was not because I didn't like it 
 I really kind of did 
 the reason I quite was just because a certain doctor that we enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that H M O 
 so my wife decided she wanted to stay with that doctor
 so we went to the medical insurance that we have here at work
 and I like the convenience of the H M O in a certain respect because even though you're 
 once you find the doctor that you like it's not a problem 
 You know a lot of people complain saying well I don't want to have to be told who I need to go to 
 but you know if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference Because you can you know if you find someone you really like 
 and then we did find several good doctors 
 And like you say it's five dollars an office visit 
 And my wife was in the hospital had our daughter 
 and I think her total bill was around three hundred dollars for everything 
 that included you know the doctors the time the hospital an- everything Delivery room and everything
 including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay 
 but that was still included in that cost 
 so 
 It's really nice because their attitude is different than a regular health insurance in a H M O you know 
 they're trying to prevent a problem by keeping the cost down at the front end you know and have you come in you know 
 they charge five dollars 
 a you know pop 
 you're more willing to go in and try to take care of a problem before it grows big
 <> Yeah
 <> Right
 Yeah 
 I really liked it 
 my wife and I both did 
 you don't have to worry about filling out forms you know for reimbursement and all or you know getting paid eight percent of whatever 
 You just pay the five dollars right then 
 and then you're done with it
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Well they're also p- 
 take- 
 they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay
 You know they get a lot of people who just have to be there and can't afford it 
 and so they know they're not going to you know get money from them 
 so they have to absorb it somewhere else
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Right 
 our insurance is doing something similar where they're also going to mor-
