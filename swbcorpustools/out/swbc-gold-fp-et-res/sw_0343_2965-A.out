 Hi 
 my last auto repair was my alternator went out 
 I have a nineteen eighty-six Toyota 
 it's a little Tercel 
 And I have a friend whose real good with repairing cars 
 so I got him to take the alternator off and take it and you know get a replacement part
 So we went to a place called Quality Auto Parts 
 and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and everything 
 and they're very reasonable 
 So I bought the alternator 
 we put it on the car 
 and it didn't work 
 and it blew out all the fuses
 Yeah
 I bel- something like sixty-nine dollars something on that order
 No 
 he hooked it up right 
 it was just that the part just didn't fit the car 
 so I took it back 
 and the guy in the parts shop took the alternator 
 and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them 
 and he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator 
 so we went back and tried it again put it on again 
 and it still didn't work 
 and we took the car up to a little place called Pep Boys 
 I don't know if you have them in your area
 but they're pretty reasonable car repair place also 
 So towed it up there because it you know wouldn't start or anything 
 and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and took them about an hour to figure out what was blowing the fuse 
 and it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse 
 Anyway ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer 
 and the only problem was that it had to be a genuine Toyota alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it that you know they sit in there and everything 
 but there's just some little difference that causes it not to work an i- 
 yeah 
 I guess so 
 and that was my last experience
 Uh-huh
 Goodness 
 are you able 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 well my car it's an eighty-six 
 and I really hadn't had any trouble with it until that 
 and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it 
 and this was just recent 
 so I really can't complain about this one
 well I used to work 
 it was a seventy mile trip everyday you know two ways was seventy miles
 No 
 it was just seventy miles
 Yeah
 And I did that for about three years 
 and it really added up 
 I've only taken maybe two trips that were about four hours long down to Shreveport 
 And the rest of it you know it's just basically driving a long ways to work 
 And now I drive like twenty-three miles each way 
 so I'm getting little relief 
 but still I drive a long ways
 But I guess because they're highway miles you know it's not so bad on your car as if it you know were just regular street you know
 Yes 
 I do
 Do you
 Points
 Uh-huh
 there's a number that you call 
 it's the same number that you call to make a call
 you call that number 
 and somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message 
 and you can leave a message
 I know someone that did that 
 you leave a message 
 and they'll call you back
 really
 Uh-huh
 let's see before I had this car I bought an Audi five thousand
 but I bought it used 
 I just bought it from a friend who just charged me what the dealer was going to give him for it for a trade-in 
 and it had a whole lot of miles on it 
 I figured maybe I'd get one or two years out of it 
 an I did get a couple of good years out of it 
 and the engine messed up on me 
 and then I gave it to a guy to repair who works for the Audi dealer 
 and he took the engine apart 
 and you know he just said he couldn't fix it 
 so the engine never got put back together again
 I 
 Wow 
 I think those old cars might be a pretty good bet because you 
 I don't know i- 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 I read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy-four
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars engines and transmissions 
 and I guess if you keep changing them out you can keep a car for a long time 
 Course I guess I could do the same thing with the Toyota that I have 
 I just don't know how much they'll want to charge me to 
 Yeah 
 I guess so 
 but I just think they cost too much in the first place now a days
