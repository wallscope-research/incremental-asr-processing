 Well my husband and I haven't done a whole lot of camping 
 but we bought a van last year
 and we were hoping to do some camping in the van 
 we did go camping in Oklahoma 
 last year we camped in a tent 
 and there were two other couples with us 
 and there was state park
 And it was really nice
 Really
 
 I don't like really camping in the rough 
 I like the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that
 Yeah 
 that would be much
 Yeah 
 the campsite that we went to was an area that 
 it's right on a big lake 
 and there's a lot of boating out there 
 and we went up there to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit 
 but it was still too cold
 Yeah 
 it was pretty early in the year
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we have a dog 
 and that's just about as bad as a kid 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I don't know how you can really keep the inside of a tent clean
 Other than you know taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and sweeping it out everyday it's really hard to keep the sand and dirt out of it
 Did 
 Uh-huh 
 did you have another a big tent looks like a sitting area type you know like a two room type 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 we don't really have a problem with that in these areas 
 and even when in Oklahoma when we camped I really didn't notice a problem with bugs 
 And I noticed that 
 I know that I said that's 
 I've lived back east before they 
 
 Really
 
 Well have you ever taken any of those what do they call this lights 
 have you ever used those
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'd like to go camping cross-country 
 I just got married less than two years ago 
 so we don't have any children yet 
 Yeah 
 so easy to pick up and go and s- 
 we have a van 
 and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it
 So it's not really I guess camping the way most people picture camping in the tent 
 but 
 Yeah 
 or get 
 my brother has a real nice pop-up
 And he just tows it behind his truck
 And he's got three kids 
 so his kids will sleep in the truck in the back of the bed 
 and they sleep in the pop-up
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 he did have a problem when he went camping last year in Beavers Bend Oklahoma 
 a storm came in 
 and it started raining really heavy 
 and everybody was trying to flee the campsite 
 everybody was getting stuck in the mud
 And 
 Well theirs was so bad 
 and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up
 and they had to get out of there
 Yeah 
 yeah they were
 But yeah 
 they decided that that was enough camping for the weekend
 No 
 they ended up getting out 
 They ended up helping several other people though that were stuck
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 the whole campsite was evacuated
 I think some people that had fairly sturdy vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water I think they stayed
 But everybody that was real close to the water ended up 
 it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream
 Yeah
 They have them right at the campsites
 Wow
