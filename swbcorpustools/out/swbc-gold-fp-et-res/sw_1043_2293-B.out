 Well discussing air pollution today I guess
 well give me your first impressions
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 puts a whole 
 yeah 
 gets a whole new picture to what real air pollution can be 
 but that stuff going on over there 
 what part of Pennsylvania are you in
 Okay 
 okay 
 so it's amazing too you know with the oil wells burning over there that's the exact same stuff that's coming out of cars every day just in a little different grade I guess 
 But in Dallas we've just brought in a whole new set of requirements on inspections and things like that for cars because people just don't use mass transit and stuff in Dallas 
 Everybody loves their car 
 and you see an awful lot of one person vehicles on the road during rush hours 
 That seems to be our biggest problem down here 
 you know there's a lot of industry around 
 but it's 
 any pollution that industry's dumping around here is not going into the air 
 It's typically water type situation
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's like two hours of output or something like that
 That's true 
 that's true
 Yeah 
 I grew up in South Dakota 
 so I was never exposed to anything of the sort 
 there were always E P A people and what not were always telling us that farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that
 but we just never saw the results 
 there was dust in the air during planting seasons and what not 
 but that was all we ever saw 
 and then five years ago I moved to Dallas 
 and I suddenly started to understand what burning eyes and all that stuff is about that I'd always heard about 
 it's real depressing 
 In the morning sometime you can tell if it's a good day or a bad day by how far out from downtown you can be on the road and still not see it
 And yeah 
 it's not 
 I don't think Dallas is considered a real bad place for air pollution 
 but you can tell the differences in the days when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a foggy misty color 
 and it's a little disappointing sometimes you start to realize what you're breathing
 Right 
 Right 
 it's that there really isn't a whole lot 
 it's one of those things that if they do a little bit and you know every little bit does help 
 I do believe that 
 but I also believe that the earth is a kind of a self-regulating system 
 and it will clean itself up eventually 
 It 
 the whole idea is not to push the limit too hard I guess
 you know let the natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 And it's one of those things 
 it's so hard to measure what the damage is
 it's kind of like 
 I guess it's kind of like cigarette smoking you know 
 it could go on for years and years until they start to see some results and people can actually say Yeah it's doing some damage and something's got to be done 
 you know there's a lot of things like that 
 It 
 you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks 
 but until it breaks you don't really know that you were doing anything to it
 But 
 Yeah 
 {D well that's 
 I think we both agree it's one of those deals that 
 I just think there's a lot of other problems right now
 and we've done a lot to take care of it
 And 
 sure
 Sure
 there's no doubt about it
 I don't know if you ever happened to see some of the like Twenty Twenty and what not about Rumania and East Germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their systems had been running for twenty and thirty years
 and you know they had absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever 
 and they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted 
 that's the kind of things that you don't see in this country 
 and that's why I think that you know it's 
 I don't know if you can ever do enough 
 but I think it's all relative to the time and place 
 and I think right now it's pretty much under control
 All righty
 Well you bet
 Bye
