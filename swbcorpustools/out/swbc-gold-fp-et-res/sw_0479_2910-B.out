 I think I get most of my news in headlines from the radio 
 and then I follow-up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I like them 
 but they take so long 
 I don't always have time 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think C N N does a pretty good job 
 I had not watched them very much except when I was abroad until the Gulf War
 And they seemed to have the best coverage 
 They had more information sooner than most of the other networks
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well I know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted 
 but I think they said that frequently enough That you shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective 
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we have a C B S twenty-four hour station that I listen to on the way to and from work 
 and 
 Northern 
 I'm from the peninsula
 Palo Alto
 Well 
 it's horrible
 The San Francisco paper is just wretched
 So I subscribe to the SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS
 Palo Alto is about midway between 
 Well it's a whole lot better than that San Francisco paper 
 and 
 Yeah 
 there's the CHRONICLE and the EXAMINER 
 but they're both run by the same peo-
 They're just horrid
 so we read 
 we can 
 but I don't like it
 So we subscribe to the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL and MERCURY NEWS 
 Yes 
 well again I read that two columns on the front 
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 and I think we do get pretty good coverage 
 I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by the news coverage
 We almost have too much
 Well I cannot stand Dan Rather
 I remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston
 And I hated him then
 And I would not watch that man for money
 And he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach
 So I watch Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw Sort of alternately 
 Do we get enough news or something like that 
 do we get the news that we want 
 And I do 
 I really think 
 Yeah
 Okay 
 well nice to talk to you
 Bye-bye
