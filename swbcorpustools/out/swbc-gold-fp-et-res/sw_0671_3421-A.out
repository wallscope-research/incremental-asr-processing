 So so what have you seen lately that you think is worthwhile
 No 
 I saw the previews
 does it have a happy ending 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 that was funny wasn't it 
 Yes 
 and the regular NAKED GUN and AIRPORT and you know
 Yes
 Right 
 So now these are for two very different movies 
 one absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly you know serious subject
 Yeah 
 I guess I have similarly broad tastes 
 my most recent movie that I liked a lot not my most recent movie was HENRY THE FIFTH 
 I only rented it you know maybe a month ago
 and it's been out for a couple of years 
 but Have you seen that
 Well it's an adaptation of the Shakespeare play 
 and it's beautifully done 
 I believe that all the language is as Shakespeare wrote it except it's been shortened a little bit 
 and there might be a word or two changed
 but it's a glorious movie
 and I like as you know these silly movies 
 and I also like just some strange movies 
 Do you have any
 Well the one that comes immediately to mind is the THE COOK THE THIEF HIS WIFE HER LOVER 
 but there are also these various David Lynch movies
 I got hooked on TWIN PEAKS 
 That made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie I could lay my hands on
 Oh 
 well I don't especially recommend 
 you have to just sort of like this thing 
 you have to like 
 did you see TWIN PEAKS
 No 
 so okay 
 So if you weren't drawn to watch that maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies either
 they're just strange
 Well I think suspense is the right word 
 but a little bit strange and esoteric 
 and in the case of TWIN PEAK there's some elements of the supernatural in it too
 That was the television show
 there's also a producer of movies in Baltimore called John Walters who puts on even weirder movies 
 his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream like HAIR SPRAY 
 but back in his early days he had things 
 what are the titles 
 I can't remember the titles any more But some really weird ones with quite a random crew of characters 
 it would have made you know these Fellini movies look normal
 I do like movies a lot
 do you rent them 
 or 
 Yes
 Yeah 
 that's what my wife does too 
 she falls asleep 
 So we have to pick just the right kind of movie to appeal
 Well well it was good talking to you
 Take care
 Okay 
 bye
