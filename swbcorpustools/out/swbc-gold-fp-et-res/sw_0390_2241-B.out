 Well pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard
 Well we just bought our house last July 
 and [ it's the house is ] forty years old 
 so there's an established lawn and whatnot flower beds things like that 
 but they've gone a few years of neglect
 So we're in the process of revitalizing the whole situation 
 We've got different flower beds in front and a built in window box trying to get some color back in those get the trees trimmed up get rid of a few weed problems and things like that
 So 
 I live in Dallas
 Okay
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I'll bet
 I'll bet
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 it's pretty high alk- w- 
 actually it's done 
 it's in the north end of Oak Cliff in Kessler Park area
 and we've got about 
 yeah 
 we've got maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil
 and then it's solid rock from then on down 
 so 
 Yeah 
 it's a little aggravating 
 we can't put in anything too big as far as shrubs and things like that because they've got to get a chance to find the cracks in the rock
 But 
 Yeah 
 it is 
 it's solid limestone
 we're just happy that there's trees already there so far
 anything like that is a major undertaking I guess 
 sprinkler systems or anything start to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock 
 But 
 and it you know not even considering a pool or anything like that practically has to be blasted in I guess 
 But 
 and it makes for a different challenge 
 I've never 
 well I moved to Dallas about five years ago
 and I never really messed with anything gardening or anything like that until now 
 but I keep hearing all the stories of different parts of town 
 In fact we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that
 and the first thing the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said I've got a dozen different varieties 
 and each one works in one part of town 
 and that's it 
 That's basically what he was trying to tell us
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it 
 Yeah 
 that wou- 
 in fact we put in some more roses yesterday
 a few different hybrid tea type varieties
 Yeah
 Okay
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's what we're searching 
 we've got all the different lake editions around the house 
 and we're kind of experimenting right now
 we've got the direct sun in front 
 and the backyard has two great big spruce and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall 
 so the backyard is just complete dark all day long
 And we're struggling to find something for those areas
 No 
 they're in pretty good condition
 we've been pretty lucky on that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 That's true 
 That's true
 It's bermuda
 Yeah
 Okay
 Right
 Yeah
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's 
 there's such a difference through the year 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 that's it 
 Yeah
 wow
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 okay
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 That really is 
 it would 
 it seem like it be just the opposite when you get 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's true that 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 That's true
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that's something I've been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are at this time of the year 
 and you know we're trying to decide what to put on one side of the house and things like that 
 but there's so many things that they last for just a couple of weeks 
 then it's just a bush there from then on 
 it's kind of disappointing
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
