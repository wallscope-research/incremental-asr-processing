 Okay Howard 
 what do you think of our space budget 
 and should we go ahead and and keep exploring 
 or should we call a halt to it 
 is it doing any good
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Oh yes 
 Wish our post office could do that 
 That's right 
 I wish they'd just deliver stuff
 Uh-huh 
 I agree 
 I agree 
 Seems like that we've kind of gotten side tracked with putting all these different things up there to monitor 
 and you know you know and I'm in favor of you know getting closer to seeing certain things 
 but I'd like to see them also go you know go back up there see you know what they can do See about setting a space station up 
 I'm all in favor of the space program 
 and I don't think we should stop 
 and I don't think we should cut the money
 Uh
 Yeah 
 I would like I'd like to see that 
 I'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and see what's going on even if you know there's no life up there or anything you know 
 But who knows 
 And I would like to see them do something like that
 I I hate to see them just you know keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things 
 and I think they I think they lose sight of of probably what they're supposed to be doing
 Yes 
 yes
 I believe they are
 You know let's go back to our original thing with you know our experiments and all the you know our actual exploring of space and and all that 
 and you know with with Russia uh seemingly not going to be as big a threat
 Huh-uh you know 
 Have you gone out to uh Fort Worth to see the space Soviet space exhibit
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 We went uh 
 we took our grandsons and went uh the weekend before last 
 and it is marvelous 
 it's really neat how they they have done it 
 They have done a beautiful job
 And they have a uh scaled down model showing how they you know fuel it you know how they uh oh the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they uh 
 all the things that are against the actual space mission uh space ship you know how they fall away from it 
 and the loading of it
 and then it's actually you know 
 the smoke comes out like it's taking off 
 It is really interesting
 You really do 
 It's it's well worth the time and effort 
 We went uh early on Sunday 
 We got out there about uh ten ten thirty 
 and the 
 No 
 we bought tickets there 
 and if you have children if you go to McDonald's you co- they have coupons or did have 
 Now they may be through with them now 
 But uh buy one adult 
 and one child gets in free
 Oh okay 
 oh okay 
 You have teenagers or something
 Yes 
 
 well I had grandchildren so three of them so between their mother and their grandfather and I 
 because their dad was at work 
 and uh But and the boys loved it you know 
 they really did like it
 Uh-huh 
 it is 
 and I felt the uh six year old would you know that he'd be kind of bored 
 but he wasn't 
 Even the three year old enjoyed it
 because they had one had one of those moon vehicles and had it so it looked like it was on the moon and showed it moving around and stuff 
 So it was really neat
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right
 Well in going through it I got the impression that actually they were farther ahead
