 Okay 
 Well 
 Ah
 Yeah
 So you haven't really uh dealt with that in a sense
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh mine are both out of school
 And uh you know I I've in hindsight seen some things that I wished that you know I had done something about that was you know within my power or uh you know wish that in some ways we as parents had more control over what's happening up there you know type thing 
 Uh well just over the years there were situations that uh uh came up that I didn't think were fair or handled correctly 
 or the teachers didn't seem to be teaching anything 
 Of course it's a little hard to tell from the information that you get from your child you know 
 They they bring things home 
 and I was never one to believe everything my kids said you know about something 
 But uh still I I questioned the ability of some of the teachers to uh really do a bang-up job 
 and yet others I know are just wonderful
 Huh
 Yeah 
 That's pretty interesting because just just because you know a subject matter doesn't mean you can teach it
 Oh yeah 
 In fact I think that's that's one of the big problems today is the the way the kids behave or act and and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what's going on in the class and disruptive 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yes 
 Some of those certainly have a lot of dis- difficulties you know with uh all sorts of things
 and I would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases
 Oh wow 
 That's encouraging
 Yeah 
 Well that's you know that's an idea 
 Maybe there need to be some radical changes made 
 Do some things that are totally different and unheard of
 Oh you're kidding
 Yeah
 Huh
 That's interesting 
 I don't know 
 Mine didn't did not fall into the gifted category 
 Nope 
 And I would never had said so either 
 Uh but uh they managed to get through although not always with flying colors 
 Uh in fact one of the incidents I was thinking of that my son had Uh he was struggling with senior English 
 and I had a meeting with the uh vice principal and the English instructor 
 and uh she showed me a paper that he had just handed in 
 And she told me what she had requested 
 And I read it 
 and while it had you know a few little grammatical problems it wasn't very long and so forth 
 I thought it had some nice well thought out uh parts to it
 She gave him an F on that paper 
 And I thought well now here you have a student who is trying to pass who is struggling with your subject 
 and you give them an F on something that doesn't seem that bad to me 
 What are you telling that student 
 You're telling them that hey you might as well forget it you know 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It's pretty sad to think uh about those who even today are graduating from school 
 and they are telling that they don't know how to read you know 
 Yeah
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 That's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it
 You would have expected them to be the last ones to 
 Yeah
 Well I can see why if you've got little ones just coming along 
 There's a a whole lot of stuff going on out there
 Yeah
