 Well not so much personally 
 but my um husband has an aunt who has been like a second mother always lived in the same town and took care of him and such 
 They live down in College Station where his parents do too 
 And they put her in a home last year
 She appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to uh not be able to be in her apartment on her own
 So they found a a place nearby that they put her in last year
 Uh yeah 
 although she is uh in pretty good health and she's doesn't take any medication 
 it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point
 Then she was starting to get uh you know lose memory sometimes and which is kind of frightening when she's in the car
 Uh
 Well yeah 
 when it finally came down to it um she just got to the point after the 
 it wasn't a very um strong stroke 
 It was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't herself anymore
 And she got kind of fearful of being on her own 
 She never really ate very well 
 It was one thing 
 She hardly ever took care of herself 
 and she didn't eat 
 She ate very poor 
 so I think she was you know bad uh nutrition on top of it 
 And uh she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore 
 So 
 Um
 Well she was almost ridiculous 
 Like she'd eat ice cream and cookies 
 She'd 
 Didn't one 
 Oh really
 Well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore
 Oh that's too much trouble 
 That's too much trouble 
 Didn't want to cook
 Yeah
 Although they've got uh Meals On Wheels Which I understand is a really good you know way to handle that so that at least they eat
 No 
 I don't think there was Um 
 I know a little bit more from a a co-worker 
 Her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in
 Um she was ambulatory 
 and so there was a lesser care 
 Uh then she got uh uh hip broken 
 and then uh she wasn't as ambulatory 
 so they were almost you know to the point of saying she can't be here anymore 
 But I remember from her checking around she ended up staying at the Arkansas House I think out in Arlington something like that
 And uh you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom All of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items 
 They're always saying that somebody's going to 
 and some of them I think unconsciously do it you know as a just you know half seni- 
 Uh So they they uh don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items Very limited space waste 
 but um at least they all seem to have uh you know people that monitor their uh medication intake and dining facilities you know go to the dining room and and eat some good meals 
 I know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in very antisocial 
 Maybe it takes a while for them to say okay well I'll be with other people 
 but 
 Yeah 
 I don't understand that they they don't want to be with anybody else
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I have a um 
 my aunt's mother is uh gotten ill recently 
 and uh she lives in Pennsylvania 
 they live in Alabama 
 And they're saying hey we need you to be closer 
 and you have women like that 
 I don't to men 
 it seems like the women out just out live their husbands but very reluctantly 
 that whole 
 they don't get out of the house 
 they don't socialize 
 but it's my home 
 and I don't want to leave it
 Uh
 Um 
 But it's it's so lonely 
 you know they can't get out and see anyone 
 and it's hard for for someone like me to understand that 
 because I th- I think what do you have there 
 It's a house
 it's walls 
 and it's furniture 
 but there's nobody there 
 Don't you want to be close to me you know be with other people 
 I just don't understand why they so much want to just stay in that building 
 And there's no family there 
 they don't get to see their grandkids 
 they don't get to see their children 
 they just there in that house
 Yeah
 That's from the child's standpoint 
 The child is going why don't you want to be close to me and your other family
 What does that house got attraction
 I know they're really proud of independence 
 Uh
 Well when she got home who took care of her
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Um 
 Yeah 
 my husband and I we have been thinking about his folks are in College Station 
 and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the Dallas area 
 and there's nothing to hold them there in College Station since they're retired 
 So we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here
