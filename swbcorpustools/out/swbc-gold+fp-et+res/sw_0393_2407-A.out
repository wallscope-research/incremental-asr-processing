 First of all I want to tell you I have two little kids 
 but they're not in public school yet 
 I I get I get that experience starting next fall with kindergarten
 Yeah
 No 
 But uh being one of these late in life mothers I've listened to everybody else's you know complaints as to wha- what's the matter with either their kids or the school system
 So I've been surprised 
 Do are do you have school age kids 
 Oh
 Such as
 Uh-huh 
 Well I heard a a frightening thing 
 Actually I didn't hear it 
 It was told to me or suggested to me uh that to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of Texas 
 and I think it's similar in in many other states if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage of uh people to teach math and sciences 
 And somebody said well you know you could go in and and substitute teach at seventy-five dollars a day 
 and there's always going to be you know somebody having a need for a math or science teacher 
 I thought Christ they're letting me in to you know 
 this would be this would be frightening 
 I don't know anything about it
 Right 
 Right 
 And even if I knew how to teach the subject matter I don't know if I'd know how to handle that kind of a a group of kids
 I tell you what I'm finding frightening 
 and this comes from you know the the aging hippie near forty mother 
 So I went through this period of supposedly you know cosmic social enlightenment
 I'm on I'm in the Plano school system and living in Richardson 
 and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school
 And I used to think well that's wonderful 
 You know they can get a real life experience 
 What I'm seeing now uh in terms of kindergarten preparedness just from in in in different preschools it's like day and night 
 And I wonder how do they handle a child who is obviously very ready and another child who doesn't even speak English let alone know her colors
 And they're in the same classrooms 
 And I guess also you're going to see the first of the uh crack kids starting kindergarten 
 My God I think it would be next year is what I'd read 
 I thought well how do you how do you weed those out 
 When I was listening to N P R the National Public Radio 
 and they've quoted statistics that I just about my throat just about fell into my toes 
 They said at the bottom of the S A T scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education
 Yes
 Yes 
 And I and I I got to thinking back when I was teaching college chemistry the people that took you know the lower level courses I sometimes wondered you know are they really even educatable or trainable 
 and it 
 my God you know i- 
 are the rest of us who went for the big bucks you know staying out of you know where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with these kids 
 I don't know 
 Well you know you you sit here 
 and you think about that 
 At the same time you think God I hope I don't sound like a stage mother because right now if you ask my friends t- put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children you're going to have twenty hands you know up there 
 Oh no 
 Nobody has nobody has a nongifted child 
 And I keep thinking you know gifted is is Einstein or you know uh musical prodigies 
 It's it's not a kid who's you know precocious
 You know what has you know has has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who's above average is now gifted
 I don't know 
 Oh don't say that
 Uh-huh
 Well you see I think that that harks right back to the elementary and junior high years 
 Because I have a stepson now who's twenty-five 
 and uh I was just absolutely shocked uh the first time that I saw his schoolwork 
 Uh I remember being you know taught 
 and I think you know you have to teach how to write an answer and you know how to construct a thought process
 And you know they can get a they can grasp the points 
 Can they convey the data verbally or in writing 
 And that's what's you know really scary to me 
 Uh I would really you know 
 there's such a a push among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate 
 I would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought and at an early age 
 And if they can't if they have missed that training then somebody you know before you're you're start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they're thinking teach them these basic skills
 Well my stepson you know I he went into the Navy or Air Force 
 I just really get my military 
 I married into a military family
 and I don't know 
 I re- address them all as generals 
 so I don't offend anybody 
 But uh you know fortunately for him he wasn't dumb 
 but boy he sure had trouble you know putting things on on paper
 And one of the things that that they did for him They tested him 
 and they said that he's you know great in electronics 
 but he you know he's really does need the basic skills 
 And they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training 
 And at that point he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors
 This is the kid who who really you know barely made it through high school 
 And I keep thinking you know it's not it's really not too late at any point to do you know some- 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 And I kind of have always pooh-poohed military educations 
 But I think that for this kid it's going to be you know his lifesaver 
 Otherwise he might have been driving trucks or framing houses you know from here to eternity
 So I don't know
 You know it does make me nervous
 There is a whole lot of stuff going on out there 
 and and part of me says I just would like to you know shut my eyes and pretend it doesn't you know go on Or send them to private schools 
 And then the you know the old social conscience says you know I'm not working I don't need to work 
 Maybe I should volunteer to you know teach what I know
 Maybe adult literacy Maybe you know composition writing Maybe you know uh volunteering you know on a tutor line or though the even through the elementary schools for help with homework 
 or the other part of me says is God I've had enough kids 
 Do I reall-
