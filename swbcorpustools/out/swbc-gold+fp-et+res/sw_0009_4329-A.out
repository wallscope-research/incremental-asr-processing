 Okay 
 so I guess it starts recording now
 Okay 
 I don't know really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in 
 We live in the Saginaw area
 Uh-huh 
 And I'm not real familiar with uh anything that 
 I 
 fact as far as I know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here And uh or the grocery store or anything in this area 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Really
 That is pretty good 
 I'm we're originally from another state 
 and I know in the state we were from that they did that t- similar type thing 
 The city brought ought you know set tr- separate trash cans 
 and you separated your stuff 
 and you put it in there 
 and they took it you know
 I don't really know
 I don't really know 
 they they started after we moved down here 
 and so I I'm not really familiar 
 I just know that uh my in-laws up in up in Oklahoma that's how they do you know they pick it up 
 but I don't know if they get a get anything back on it 
 or do you get money for it
 Oh
 Really 
 Right
 Right 
 And now now most of them are throwaway
 I think now they're a lot more expensive than that 
 Uh I bought some Cokes the other day in the br- the little bottles you know 
 and I think the bottles were like I know they were at least ten cents apiece 
 I started to see at home 
 I was like God how much were those bottles you know 
 And it was they come in like uh eight and and eight and ten packs you know instead of six packs 
 and uh and they were like it was like two dollars and something for the bottles 
 You know I was like God Almighty 
 it costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes
 In the bot- 
 Right
 Oh really
 Of green glass
 Well out in this area they really don't have anything 
 Now I know that like Minyard's and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have like four different bins out front Uh different colors for different things and and things like that 
 but I I do know some of these places were doing that 
 and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 more than it's worth
 Right 
 Well who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away 
 Right 
 uh yeah
 It was nice talking to you 
 I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything
 I- 
 Is that it
 Okay 
 well it was nice talking to you 
 and I I guess I'll do this for I was doing this for actually I was going to do it for my son so that he could uh he he's in high school so that he could make some money
 Uh but then it has my name on it 
 so I'm like okay 
 I'll sit down here and call it 
 Oh are you
 Oh that's interesting
 That's nice 
 Well 
 Thank you 
 Bye
