 Uh anyway we're supposed to talk about recycling Basically what what your personal opinion is on it 
 Uh this is this is really for a speech research project they're doing 
 so uh I don't know 
 Florida is pretty good about recycling isn't it
 Oh they did
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Not quite 
 no
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Okay
 Yeah
 Okay
 Oh that's that's good 
 Let me ask you this 
 Do they require you to presort it
 Okay 
 See that's something in Minneapolis they're really strict on 
 In terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really you know tightly 
 But when I lived in Orlando it's like you could put almost anything in there
 and they'd just sort it out for you 
 It was really pretty good if you're lazy like I am 
 so 
 Oh okay 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 It can 
 yeah 
 Right
 Yeah 
 you got to tie them up and everything 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Exactly
 It is you know a big hassle
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 up here they give you one one of those containers 
 and you put everything in it
 So it's like if if you use a lot of stuff you 
 it's like well you know if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink you know like a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend it's going to be hard pressed to p- to put all your recyclables in that one place you know 
 So it's kind of a pain in the butt 
 But uh I don't know 
 That's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you know 
 You have have those garbage people that make how every many make tw- twenty thirty bucks an hour 
 have them do a little bit of the sorting You know And and maybe come up with a better system 
 Make it a little more convenient 
 But 
 Yeah
 Oh you can actually rent those
 Okay 
 That's interesting 
 Yeah 
 up here the the city provides them 
 Kind of like 
 Oh okay 
 So where exactly are you in terms of of like Sarasota 
 Are you north of Sarasota or East 
 okay 
 And Sarasota is on the west coast
 Okay 
 Like south of Tampa right
 Okay 
 I'm 
 Yeah 
 that's 
 Okay
 Um occasionally
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
