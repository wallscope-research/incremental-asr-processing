 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Well uh just really the last couple of days since this uh the U N debate or whatever you want to call it that uh voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire 
 I guess you know the thing really isn't over
 They uh they had uh kind of uh I don't know if you call it standout or whatever 
 but anyway they stopped and waited to see if Iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though 
 As I understand it from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the U N uh had set up you know the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all unless they're just absolutely forced to 
 So I guess from what I understand the thing could just it could just they could take off at any moment without uh you know you know any local you know congressional effort or anything else because you know it's not really settled yet
 Not yet 
 Not yet at all
 Uh-huh
 No
 Yeah 
 I don't know why they expect it's going to start this week you know
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 The uh the thing that's kind of interesting about this 
 my sons in the Air Force
 And uh he came within a quarter of an inch of going uh to Saudi 
 he ended up in Korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in Lubbock
 So he ended up going to Korea 
 and his buddies ended up going to Saudi 
 Well he's still in Korea and his buddies home now 
 He he almost wishes that that he could have gone home
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 The thing uh the other thing too when this all started if you you know if you did much reading on the thing you know Kuwait the country of Kuwait was just you know somebody's uh 
 you go back to World War I when the uh Ottoman empire broke up and the British and the French and the yeah the British and the French mostly decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it Persia and part of it Iraq and part of it something else you know 
 and they they split things along um geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into uh social or cultural things at all
 So the country of of Kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense except that it is an excepted place you know
 it's like any other country you know 
 for whatever reason it's it's actually there 
 Well Iraq has had uh designs on that place since nineteen twenty-two 
 so you know it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up
 And it's just that this was an excuse you know to make some noise 
 Now something that I read in the paper the other day that I thought was kind of interesting was that the Arab uh uh their version or vision or whatever the United States now is somewhat changed in that we won you know
 Now now we are a uh a legitimate player in the game over there you know 
 the the 
 I don't think we can really understand their attitude because there cultures are just so much different
 But uh we are now a legitimate player in the in the in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we you know we defeated 
 you know Iran couldn't do it in seven years 
 and we went in and did in seven days what Iran couldn't do in seven years you know
 So 
 that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit 
 It makes us more legitimate 
 So now what they're saying is that well since we won whatever we say goes because it's uh a kind of a might make strike sort of attitude about it 
 and you know we've got the power Which is why for centuries or hundreds of years the British and the French had so much influence in there 
 because they'd go in and they'd win something
 And then and then they could call the shots for the you know period of time until the next strong man came up and you know and caused problems
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Um Yeah 
 That's that's the uh that's that's the big thing you know 
 we still got a little bit of the old you know Vietnam um problem you know in the back of our minds 
 We we got this 
 we're we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out 
 Vietnam we never did get out you know never did get the job done because they were too ham strung 
 Uh this thing 
 they they gave the guys uh the power and the material and the told them to go do it and they did it You know got in and got out 
 I'm not sure 
 the the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks I would think is uh you know the uh the business with the uh the Shiites of all people you know in the southern part of the country and also the Kurds 
 because these people evidently are you know being killed off by the thousands
 And whether the the United Nations 
 I don't think the U S will do it on their own 
 but whether the United Nations comes around and says hey wait a minute we know this thing isn't uh all that much over we've got to go back in there and and be sure that this large population isn't just wiped out 
 Which is seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment
 But um you know 
 Oh well No 
 No
 there there never will be
 uh uh the only way that you're going to have peace over there if if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them 
 you know until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but I don't think we want to make that decision either
 So that's that's a little rough you know 
 we're not we're not quite up to that sort of thing
 So 
 Oh 
 Oh well that's that's fun
 You too
 Bye-bye
