 Okay uh 
 well do you uh keep a family budget 
 or do you have some 
 Uh-huh
 Oh interesting
 Yes 
 well uh we sort of started doing it years and years ago 
 and my husband started graduate school when we were first married 
 and I sort of just got in the habit I guess And you know never have gotten out of it 
 I cannot really say that it's a formal budget 
 it's more just a a pretty uh a fairly uh accurate uh recording of what I spend and what I think I am going to have to spend 
 And uh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 That sounds real similar
 Um
 Oh my 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Sure
 Yeah 
 I think you are right um uh 
 well i- it must have been sort of interesting to us 
 is to uh it's because since I have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years I guess I can go back and look 
 and it's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years Uh
 For instance 
 My goodness
 Oh dear
 Yes
 Oh yes
 Well as a matter of fact uh my mother was going through some things not lon- not long ago I guess it has been a couple of years ago in an old trunk that she had 
 And she came upon a a budget book that she had back in the thirties Uh when they 
 it was the late well 
 I guess it would have been I will take that back it must have been in the forties because they had been married uh probably fifteen years at the time 
 And it was just uh fascinating to see how little things cost 
 it was it was just almost laughable in some instances that you know 
 of course it's all relative of course
 but uh never the less it was fun to see those figures next to you know 
 for a pr- pair of shoes was like five dollars 
 and 
 Um
 Oh
 Oh isn't that something
 Really 
 Oh that is that is really really something
 That's true
 Yeah 
 that's that's right 
 That's exa- that's just good old economics working
 Well uh we have tried to uh instill some some sense of uh of budgeting in our kids 
 but our two children are just uh as um unlike as night and day 
 And our son could care less about a budget 
 and our daughter watches her pennies so closely that she almost she almost just sounds like your father 
 she has everything planned so closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a loop 
 Yes
 Right 
 yes
 Yes
 Yeah
 I think that is true 
 I uh 
 and I think that is probably what happened in our house 
 because I think my husband was not quite as uh good at saving and so on before we got married 
 and I was I was really diligent about that 
 I was putting money aside and when before I was married you know when I was working out of college 
 and uh that really paid off 
 Because when time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts 
 And 
 Yeah
 Uh he is an engineer 
 he is uh an electrical engineer And in fact went through uh many years of graduate school and got his P H D 
 so we had a lot of lot of years of budgeting 
 And you know 
 Yeah
 When you 
 uh yes
 Well I'm working I'm working on my masters degree now 
 so in fact this last year we had three 
 both of the children were in college 
 our son has a year left 
 and our daughter graduated this year 
 and I'm just about ready to finish my masters degree
 so we have had uh once again you know some really a real lean year for us
 But uh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 you know exactly what it what it's like then
 And it's uh 
 which you learn 
 I guess you figure that that is an investment that is uh really a in- invaluable 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 That is right 
 so it's it's one that you can live through 
 And I think that that's the way that we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school that there was a light at the end of that tunnel You know that that it was worth it to save and to not have uh something and uh in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it 
 so uh it really makes it easier 
 but uh well I have enjoyed talking with you Jerry
 And I I wish I could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me 
 I am interested in that 
 Oh
 Oh wow 
 Well my my husband and I just went there last year 
 um actually we did not take a tour 
 we we were in England and and uh went to Ireland and Scotland and just rented cars and did it on our own 
 but uh um I 
 that sounds interesting 
 Is your business in Dallas then
 Okay
 Oh you are kidding
 Well I'm going to be teaching at Brookhaven in the fall 
 Kuenzer K U E N Z E R

 Bye-bye
