 Well our public schools are are really poor I feel
 Uh I'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation 
 but uh we're toward the bottom
 And uh there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong That you would think it would be easy to correct
 But the system doesn't allow for the corrections 
 How about you
 Oh yes
 Yes
 And Cobb County is better than the county I'm in
 She was in Cobb County
 Uh-huh
 Okay 
 Well that's great
 Uh-huh
 Well I feel that we're way behind 
 Uh I have a son that is in the fourth grade
 and uh they have just now taken up division
 Yeah 
 And 
 uh i- 
 e- 
 my husband and I go to the store 
 and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication division things 
 and I feel like uh there are several areas that we're just really really slow in
 And uh I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system 
 It is 
 Well well for one thing there's not enough money in the school system 
 And the money they do have they're not they do not use <> it wisely
 Uh she my son's teacher has twenty-seven students
 And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis Uh 
 but more than that I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children
 And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps ca- the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office It it you know it can it can really be bad 
 Uh also I think we have a lot of uh Hispanics
 and we have a lot of uh 
 the county I am I'm in the minorities are mostly Hispanic 
 No 
 We're from a county we're from the county they marched in 
 We're in Forsyth county 
 yes 
 and we 
 and there's very very few blacks
 Uh so so that's uh 
 I I hate to say uh 
 it's not a problem uh because I hate to feel like they are a problem although they are 
 But it is a problem Uh especially in the inner schools inner city 
 Well 
 and you can't put all the children in special education
 Uh and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done you know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 But your teacher had control
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I believe I was too
 Uh-huh 
 Uh well it it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school
 We just cannot afford it
 Uh if
