 Okay 
 What do you think about it 
 Uh-huh
 That's interest- 
 yeah 
 I think that's uh I think it's a little crazy 
 I worked with Spanish people for about two years 
 and just it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers
 Right
 Right 
 exactly
 Yeah 
 I think you know I think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to to protect you know the people who are in the states
 Uh-huh
 Oh you're kidding 
 Sounds like a lot of fun 
 Yeah 
 it's amazing to me how how many things they would allow to occur before you know you can come in
 Right 
 Yeah 
 it's kind of frustrating too for those who are legitimate now
 You know I think 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 exactly 
 And I think it's important that they you know they allow a good number of people in every year 
 because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that that we don't want to do
 And I just 
 I don't know 
 I have personally I have a problem with it 
 I think that you know if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that we shouldn't close our door
 And you know I I believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when you you know send them back to their country
 And I think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in 
 and 
 Yeah 
 and that's that's what I think 
 You know I I have to laugh 
 because like I said I worked with a lot of those 
 and they'd been deported two or three times 
 and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for Christmas Or for any other time 
 But I think you know I think all in all there's a lot of improvements 
 I think the general idea is good 
 but but there could be some work done in the area
 Well good 
 Anyway do you have anything else in the the subject uh that you might want to talk about 
 Yeah 
 absolutely 
 I think a lot of times we take you know basically who we want to 
 because if you if you have connections it's a lot easier to get in
 Yeah 
 and I think you know it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent you know And that it should be equal to all 
 and then not like the United States 
 basically it's not who you know 
 it d- it doesn't become a thing of who you know but but how the type of person you are
 And it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people like probably your husband can get in 
 Well great
 
 Yep 
 Well let's see 
 is there anything I believe in 
 No 
 I'm not sure how long they're supposed to be 
 but I've enjoyed it 
 It's good hearing your your point of view 
 and I think that's neat 
 I think we agree a lot on that 
 and I've learned something from it 
 Well thanks 
 I'm glad you're home 
 You have a good evening all right
 Thanks 
 bye-bye
