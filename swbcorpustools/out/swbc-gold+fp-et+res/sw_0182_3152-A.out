 But that's been it's been fun 
 it's a lot of work to see that she's prepared 
 but it's been fun 
 it's been fun 
 I feel like I've learned a lot about the piano 
 I've learned a lot about playing the piano
 And uh it kind of makes me listen a little closer to to the piano when I hear it at other places or when I you know see some see and hear someone playing 
 I sort of watch their technique too and and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning
 So it's been fun
