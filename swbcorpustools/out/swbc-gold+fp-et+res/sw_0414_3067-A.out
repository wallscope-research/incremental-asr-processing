 In my my uh father's family we get together every year at a different location either Dallas or Oklahoma City 
 They had chosen Santa Barbara California for this summer and and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far because most of us live either in the midwest or like in the Texas Oklahoma area 
 And uh so they cancelled that one and uh are looking next year bringing it back closer 
 but we have a letter a family letter that circulates 
 and it usually goes through me twice a year 
 and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top 
 and then that's the way it's kept in order 
 And then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion you do not feel like I do not know anything about this person 
 You have read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth 
 So you are kind of half way acquainted that way 
 And that that's been a that's been a nice way of keeping us all aware of each other I think
 We tried to start that in my husband's family 
 His mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago 
 and I said well let's start this letter 
 and it just never 
 my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us 
 and that's as far as it got 
 I sent it on to the next one 
 and and but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in Scottsdale Arizona for that family 
 We are real glad we got together because since that that time there were only like two of the one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left 
 And the sister-in-law died 
 and the sister is in a nursing home 
 so we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago
