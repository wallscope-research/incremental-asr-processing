 Uh yes 
 I I've read uh several good books lately 
 Uh lot of them related to uh business and financial matters since that's what I do for a living
 How about yourself
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Well that sounds good
 No 
 I read for pleasure some also 
 I read a book recently called IRON JOHN
 Have you seen that by Bly
 Okay 
 Well it's a book about uh uh Greek gods and and Greek uh mythology as well as uh man and interacting with other men and a book about uh men and how they mature through life
 And how they deal with life itself 
 But it's uh it's all revolved around uh mythology Uh as far as uh traditions from uh other cultures and our culture And how we uh interact with one another
 Yes
 Yes
 By Bly 
 B L Y I believe it is
 Uh-huh
 And uh it's a very interesting book
 Well it depends again if we're talking about uh 
 I read a lot of religious books Uh just because I have an interest in that area
 And I read a lot of books in the area of uh uh psychology and self-help type uh materials
 Uh always trying to understand people better and understand myself in relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because I'm in a people business
 And uh so that that's 
 my work is my hobby 
 So I I enjoy it
 Well I don't know if I have a favorite uh religious author 
 I would have to say that uh some of the ones that consistently put out good materials uh you know 
 that that's difficult because one person might write one book extremely well and some other ones might not write as well
 Uh I had to stop here and think a second 
 One of the ones that I've read recently that I've read several of his books 
 and I thought that each one of his books were good 
 He's the man out of San Antonio 
 And uh 
 Max Lucado
 Max consistently writes good books
 Yes 
 I know him 
 yeah
 But uh there's other authors also that have uh uh that write good books from time to time but not consistently put out the materials all the time 
 Uh I'd say another which is a local writer here in Plano uh is uh 
 I'm trying to think of his name 
 He's with the Bible church 
 And that is uh 
 <> I see his name 
 but I can't 
 I see him 
 but I can't see his name 
 But [ he uh he talks about ] + uh he talks about ] a lot of different topics 
 and
