 No
 I'm definitely 
 I do like to walk
 Yes 
 Since T I has uh uh instituted that um walkabout I have gone out and started walking even more bought me the you know the proper shoes and everything to get started and uh park out there you know way out there in the boondocks
 It was so funny the other day 
 I took some guys to to lunch 
 and when we came back they said "Oh there's a parking space real close" and I parked way out in the boonies
 and I said "you can walk off your lunch"
 Yeah
 Um um Oh
 Uh-huh
 Um um Um um
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Oh no
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Oh no
 Yeah
 Um um Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 There you go
 Well you know I have noticed too that uh when I started the exercise uh not the exercise but the walking program uh that I did tone up you know like all over
 but it didn't get the upper part of my body
 and uh so what I do is I bowl 
 I am a fanatic when it comes to bowling 
 and I used to bowl five times a week
 so I really loved it
 and I still bowl at least once a week now on a league on on a 
 and I'm bowling on the T I league
 Um but I've noticed that what I do is that I have my towel that sits on the floor so that every time I get up to bowl I have to bend over to pick up my towel 
 and that way I get the little extra exercise
 I'm always explaining to people I do little things like that like you know take the stairs instead of the um the elevator
 and I do silly things like that versus a a regular program that you would have
 It sure does
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 There you go
 Um um Um um That's true
 That's true
 No 
 I used to 
 I really did uh years ago 
 and uh I was thinking about that not too long ago that I used to walk 
 and not only did I walk 
 but I used to watch all those exercise programs on T V 
 and I would tape them
 and then I would do them like two times a day 
 but I don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore 
 I think having children everything just kind of everything goes by the wayside
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Me too
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Um um Um um
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 [ running + Oh yeah 
 tha- that's enough
 Well mine are older now doing uh their own things 
 so
 Oh yes 
 Yes 
 I have a thirteen year old and an eleven year old 
 so 
 Yes
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 We're actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager 
 Yeah 
 you watch it'll be exactly the same 
 It does 
 it it absolutely does 
 so 
 Yeah 
 I I I know I just know you can't 
 But no 
 I don't get as much exercise as I used to 
 but I at least since T I has implemented that program I do 
 I'm more aware of it
 and you know that I'm need to do this that and the other 
 and uh so I try to do combinations of things but not like go down to the President's Health Club like I see all these people do
 It is 
 it is
 Yeah
 Um um
 Oh yeah
 Oh yeah
 And it gets worse 
 it doesn't get any better
 Yeah 
 because I'm constantly running my children around someplace 
 and that's where I actually get my exercise is running them from here to there in the car
 There you go 
 that's it 
 that's it
 Well it was nice talking to you
 Yeah 
 well okay 
 we'll talk to you later
 Um um 
 Bye-bye
