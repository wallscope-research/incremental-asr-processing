 Uh-huh
 Well here in Saskatoon uh much the same thing 
 There is no curb pick up of uh any of the recycled products 
 Uh we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people 
 Uh there are areas where we could uh 
 actually we have a couple of the uh handicapped societies types of places where the uh one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers 
 so uh we are able to uh have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing 
 and then there are there's a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers Well primarily soft drink bottles 
 and so we are able uh to take it to one of the uh rehabilitation centers 
 and then they recycle the containers 
 They refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container 
 and then 
 Right
 On the on primarily on soft drink pops and that kind of thing
 and uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers 
 Uh we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well
 and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those 
 So uh it's fairly fairly extensive 
 but then again it's uh it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city
 Well actually there's there's the opportunity for both
 Generally the uh the handicapped group takes care of the things that 
 actually the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to re- recycle the bottle so that you get your money back 
 and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit 
 and then I and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well 
 Oh yeah 
 Uh I guess partly because of our climate 
 Here in Saskatoon at least the majority of central uh 
 well I want to say Central Canada 
 but Central Canada tends to referred more to Ontario and Quebec
 but uh we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people 
 We certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfa- welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing 
 Uh there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although uh scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds uh regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes
 They have done it some uh 
 but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers 
 They are actually at virtually all of the shopping centers Like the shopping malls 
 There are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects 
 or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins 
 and then the bins are collected
 Uh some of the
