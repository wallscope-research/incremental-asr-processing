 I really haven't seen any movies lately 
 so when the computer picked this one I was a little bit surprised 
 but I think I haven't been to the movie theater here in about oh six months 
 but uh you know the last movies that I've seen were probably on video 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 now I ha- I haven't seen THE TERMINATOR movie 
 but and that's kind of blood and guts isn't it 
 I don't particularly care for that sort of stuff
 Yeah 
 right
 Yeah 
 he maims them pretty good doesn't he
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I I saw uh SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY 
 Uh Uh I saw it uh 
 oh couple weeks ago I rented it and uh watched it 
 and I was I was pretty disappointed in it 
 because I I was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense
 and I was pretty disappointed in it
 Now it's a good movie 
 but I guess that they built me up too much For my expectations in it there
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Now I haven't seen it either 
 but uh I've heard that it's real long That it's a good movie but it's long like three hours
 That's right
 That's right
 OSCAR
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I know my daughter saw that 
 and she liked it 
 so 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And of course I get to watch all these movies like LOOK WHO'S TALKING and WHO'S LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO 
 and because I have a ten year old 
 so We we watch a lot of movies around that category you know that she that she can watch 
 Yeah 
 We seen THE LITTLE MERMAID too
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 And there's some I think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video uh SHIPWRECKED
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 it's fixing to come out on video 
 and boy I can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out
 But 
 Uh-huh

 Uh-huh 
 Well I'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's right *[[slash error]] And then they go to the dollar movies
 Uh-huh
 Yeah

 Right
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Golly 
 I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie
 Oh that's the that's the one where they burn down the house or something
 the house explodes
 Oh okay
 Okay

 Another movie that I want to see if it ever comes out on video so I can see it without my daughter around is uh oh

 Uh Oh it's supposed to be a real scary one 
 Uh darn 
 well here here's another one that I've seen
