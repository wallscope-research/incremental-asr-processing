 Hello
 Did I reach the Dallas area
 Did I reach the Dallas area
 Dayton Ohio 
 I'm from North Carolina
 In Raleigh
 Yeah 
 so *[[need slash]] My name is Fernando
 *[[sd]] So um do you well 
 how'd you find out about this
 Oh okay 
 he works for T I
 Oh okay 
 because I'm down at N C State
 And so I took a class 
 and he said sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes 
 So are you ready
 Okay 
 let's get started <>
 Okay 
 so uh what do you think that uh 
 what do what do what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America
 Yeah 
 but what what what are the steps
 Well see the problem is is that um what happens is as that you're uh you know as you go from the country to a city crime always increases right
 Because in the country people still respect uh the property of other people
 And so as as 
 and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city
 Now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities 
 and they rush to get the same thing 
 They say why can't we have the same things that these other people have 
 and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs 
 and what we have to do is we have to go uh get some stuff steal it and then you know just resell it
 Which one 
 Yeah
 That's uh that's uh the main reason I think uh everywhere 
 because uh you have deaths 
 you have murders 
 and you have you know people stealing other people's stuff 
 and that's 
 a lot of it has to do with drugs
 It doesn't have to do 
 the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere right 
 and like let's say you you're you're you know you're driving out 
 and you're driving back home 
 and it's late at night 
 And you stop by one of these you know twenty-four hour you know gas stations joints
 And uh somebody walks in there with a gun 
 they're going to want the money 
 and you can tell by the people who are always caught that these people are there to get money for drugs 
 they don't want the money so uh so they can do something else with it
 Right 
 right 
 and so 
 Okay 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 there's a there's a uh a song that I know which says you know tha- 
 it's like in uh nineteen eighty-eight nineteen eighty-nine the local state and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in America 
 and uh their figures I think are too so 
 it's like compared to you know compared to weapons or stuff like that you're spending nothing on on crime in the country itself 
 What you're doing is you you know 
 it's like you have other things you know 
 you have the AIDS 
 we're going to solve try to solve the AIDS problem while while you know some people are getting killed here and there 
 and then 
 Uh-huh
 But those people never get caught 
 The people that that that I 
 see their theory is that if I'm surrounded and I'm going to be caught I'm going to try to find my way through 
 and they're not going to take me alive
 But I have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me
 You know it's like 
 of course I might be you know the the leading drug dealer here 
 but you won't find me dealing in drugs 
 there's no connection between me and the people that were caught you know 
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I was I was at a at a party on Saturday 
 and this guy comes over 
 he goes hey how you doing 
 he started talking to me 
 and this guy was from Jamaica right
 And he's got his little brother selling drugs <>
 You know and he goes yeah I just came up here to work 
 and I go oh you did you make very good money up here 
 He goes yeah I make a lot a lot of money 
 he goes you know 
 And uh in the movie GOOD FELLOWS 
 Did you see it
 Okay 
 in one part the guy goes out of jail 
 and within uh two months he has all his house payments gone everything paid you know 
 and he had enough money to you know 
 it's like those guys at one point you know they had so much money that they didn't know what to do with it 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's that that was also in the movie
 Yeah 
 So hello Mary
 We've been talking for five minutes
 All right okay 
 same here
 Bye-bye
