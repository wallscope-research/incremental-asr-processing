 Do you remember when you were in Washington Sam the Argentine baker
 It used to be in Georgetown years ago 
 He moved 
 I guess he he retired and went back to Argentina 
 I guess in nine- the early seventies
 Yeah 
 so that mus- that's before your time
 Your parents might remember if they were here then
 Okay

 We used to get the most marvelous impenadas <> and other Argentine things
 Yeah 
 I'm Italian
 Uh-huh
 Yeah well
 Because there're many Italians in Argentina
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 My grandparents my grandfather came to the United States through Argentina
 This was around the turn of the century Actually actually a little bit later like nineteen thirteen nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen 
 *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] well I'll tell you 
 it's interesting because when we cook here 
 I'm of Italian descent 
 My husband is Chinese
 So we and we both love Continental cooking French cooking
 So we cook uh 
 our meals are well 
 we don't we don't usually mix 
 I mean that sometimes 
 well if we're entertaining we'll do a Chinese recipe
 and um there are really easy recipe 
 you know with Chinese you always have several dishes 
 And nowadays with microwaves 
 you can steam many of the things in a microwave
 I don't know if you have one
 And if you like Chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some uh waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done 
 and it's a wonderful um flavorful piece of fish 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish mar- the fish counter 
 Um any white fish 
 Sole is good uh um flounder
 sole or flounder is real good And even grouper
 Little bit of soy sauce and sesa- sesame seed oil
 And not too much soy sauce 
 Uh some chopped up scall- um you know slivers of scallions And slivers of ginger And then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes 
 And if the fish flakes it's done 
 Don't overcook it though
 Well you see just check it you know during 
 And another quick dish if you like um do you know what hoi sin sauce is 
 *[[two utts]] it's that sweet Chinese sauce
 Well if you go in a Chinese store ask for hoi sin H O I S I N
 H O I 
 S I N or S E N
 either way they'll spell it Hoi Sin sauce 
 It's a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown 
 And if you take uh little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork And you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in You can even put a spoon of ketchup in 
 and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce that you can serve over rice
 Um well 
 For two people um Amer- if it's American style I buy a half a pound If you know we if you're just serving that 
 but if you're serving another dish with it say the rice dish um well with guys pretty healthy appetites I'd probably go a third of a pound 
 and then you know you could 
 And you can always you can always heat it up again and save you know
 Yeah
 You can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef
 Just stir fry the ground beef 
 Drain off the oil 
 Use the same hoi sin sauce and some of the frozen mixed vegetables
 Just stir that in 
 and you've got a very colorful side another dish
 Um the hoi sin sauce
 Oh a dollar twenty-nine a can
 A can would serve you for for you know for quite a few um meals you know
 Oh no 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 it's not expensive at all 
 It's one of the Chinese cooking basics
 Yeah 
 well listen it was good talking with you
 Hope you enjoy your recipe
 Okay 
 Bye-bye
