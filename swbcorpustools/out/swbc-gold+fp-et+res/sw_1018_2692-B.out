 Uh yeah 
 I am
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I've been uh 
 I uh 
 It is Friday 
 yeah
 that's for sure 
 Well uh I guess 
 I'm trying to think the last thing I did to a car
 Oh wow 
 Okay
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Sure 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Really
 Yeah 
 That's that's the aggravating thing 
 Yeah 
 I I try to do as much as I can 
 I uh I grew up on farm so I've got that uh you know take care of yourself attitude
 And uh oh I've done + I've done various things 
 I've got an I've got an eighty-three T Bird 
 and I've I've changed out uh heater core and uh oh timing belts and things like that 
 Um I guess the last thing I took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car um when we went in for inspection
 It didn't it didn't quite pass
 So we had to have uh 
 that's uh that's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it
 And they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out to get to it
 And uh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I've uh I'm kind of stuck on them right now I guess 
 But you know that's 
 it's partially because I can work on them 
 That's uh that's that's that's a big part of my decision 
 But uh yeah 
 we ran into some problems with uh having them to work on that carburetor 
 they get they got everything tuned up right you know 
 But they 
 we got I got it home 
 and uh and they had left the uh oil f- uh cap off and it was rubbing on a belt 
 and it rubbed a notch in that
 Li- little things like that that really start to aggravate you 
 That that's a lot of the reason I do my own stuff
 Uh-huh 
 Sure Sure 
 that's right
 Sure 
 Yeah 
 i- 
 Any anything that gets that that's in a gets to be an an assembly line type operation 
 you're you're always risking that 
 If there's too many people that get their hands on one little project you know that things they're you get y- you miss that overlap sometimes 
 and and they miss things 
 Yeah 
 I've I've had a hard time finding anybody I can trust 
 Like like you say it it well transmissions and things like that 
 I'm obviously I'm not going to I'm not going to tear apart a automatic transmission and try rebuild it 
 But uh i- it it's it's real stressful to try to find anybody that I think's going to do me right And and uh you know have an idea of what's going on
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well yeah 
 That that 
 the biggest you know that's the three biggest things to me you know 
 I- 
 i- 
 number one you've got to have the tools around
 If you don't have the the special tools or 
 well any more 
 the the testers that you know 
 I I don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting in my garage you know 
 So obviously if it starts my car starts missing or something like that th- it's almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics 
 But at the tools and the space to do it that that can be a big problem if it's if it's under carriage or something like that 
 But then it's experience 
 You know you can you can look through a a Chilton's book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it 
 But you better figure on multiplying that time out about by at least by five or so Ju- just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart 
 That was that was the biggest thing when I did uh the heater core in my T Bird 
 That is got to be the worst location for it
 And and the only reason I did it 
 I 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 The the only ones I've ever heard good good things about are are the old Lincolns and Cadillacs where they had the little door underneath the hood 
 You just open the door and pop it out
 Yeah 
 But but uh I I had I had taken this in to have it done originally
 And uh 
 Oh it it was it was tremend- 
 well it was about seven hours labor
 So it it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so
 And they looked it over and they they they thought they could patch it up a little bit you know and what not 
 So they 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 And it was it was leaking inside the car in the condenser unit 
 So uh they they did a little patch on it 
 and it l- it held for about four to six months 
 And I finally went back in and started looking at it myself 
 And i- it's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff 
 but 
 hey 
 it was not uh it was not a seven hour labor job for me 
 It was about a week before I finally through 
 Yeah
 Oh really
 No 
 this this was 
 the only thing that sticks in inside the engine compartment on this are the two uh hose fittings
 Yeah 
 It it's 
 I I've never heard a good story about uh 
 Yeah
 Right 
 Okay
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 You bet 
 Well that that's what ended up being the real problem on this was the uh i- the the pipe wasn't busted 
 but the 
 it wasn't soldered in good enough
 And it had it had broken loose enough to where if it got hot 
 and just normal driving didn't do it 
 But if if if it was an especially hot day the pressure would get high enough and it would start blowing the water out inside
 It was real aggravating 
 but uh I I couldn't eve- even 
 a week's a week's time is is worth a whole lot less than four than four hundred dollars to me you know than to have somebody else do it
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 That's true
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well yeah 
 A- 
 and and not only from a from an economic standpoint just just pure safety you know 
 If you can if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait 
 It it it can it can save a lot of time and trouble
