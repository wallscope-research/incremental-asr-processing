 Well th- the question was talking about the juries 
 and uh one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having that especially for repeat offenders that uh 
 maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again 
 Uh so that uh a judge I think would be the most appropriate person to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day
 *[[slash error]] *[[slash error]] Right
 *[[slash error should be 'aa']] Right <>
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 See I agree with you 
 Uh one thing I heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have a a mock court 
 it's supposed to be all legal and everything 
 Uh you go 
 and you present your case 
 the other side presents their case 
 and you're done with it 
 It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V
 Uh and uh but it's not that we have uh such 
 it didn't backlog or all of the uh the cases that are uh all ready pending 
 Uh so I 
 that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way
 Yes 
 Yes 
 Now 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 *[[slash error]] Oh yes 
 *[[slash error should be aa]] and and I wasn't I didn't mean that 
 I I didn't mean that no 
 Because gee whiz if I was uh uh didn't have that right you know not to have a jury that oh 
 yes I would feel uh you're right that my civil rights had been violated 
 But I meant for some when both parties agreed that yes we're going to have a judge here 
 We're not going to have a jury you know 
 let's get it over with 
 Sort of like car accidents you know 
 Yeah
 *[[slash error]] *[[slash error]] Right 
 *[[slash error should be 'aa']] right 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Giving a different sentence 
 Uh-huh
 The take 
 Right
 Well I I i- we're at liberty to to talk and and meander as long as it's all on the same theme
 Uh-huh
 *[[slash error]] *[[slash error]] *[[slash error]] *[[slash error]] Right 
 *[[slash error should be 'aa']] Right 
 *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 bu- well you can tell I haven't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that 
 N- 
 well I was called once when I was nineteen
 and uh but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me 
 and I was doing school and things like 
 they they let me out
 An- I've never had to it since 
 and that was almost twenty years ago 
 *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
