 Well how how do you feel about the immigration laws
 Yeah 
 well I'm not real sure why I got this topic because I don't think I checked it off on the list because I know very little about the current immigration laws
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 No 
 that doesn't make a whole of lot sense
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well uh my uh my family is from uh Europe from well from England and Ireland and uh have been in this country for oh more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years 
 so I don't have any any uh relatives that I am uh several generations back that I am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family 
 They were all they were all born here
 so I don't have any real strong ties with any with with the immigration laws 
 I don't because I don't I don't have any personal feelings about them 
 and I haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I Well I agree with that 
 I I think if immigration was entirely unrestricted uh not only would would the United States become over populated well more over populated awfully quickly I think it it would bring in a lot of uh people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in in other countries 
 I think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their their brand of crime
 I was not aware aware of that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I think so 
 Well I've enjoyed talking to you
 Okay 
 Thanks
 Bye
