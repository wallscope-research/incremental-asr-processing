 Advice for people taking for parents uh help their kids through college
 No 
 I just graduated from college
 Yes
 I went to Clarion
 Uh-huh
 Um I would want them to make that decision 
 and I would you know 
 uh I pretty much made my decision on my own and my b- older brother likewise
 And uh you know we we were both pretty much happy with what we did
 So I think I would not push them towards any one place
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 exactly
 I think one of the first things kids ought to look for is first of all they have to decide what they want to major in And then you know find a school that's good for that
 Well I picked it for a couple of reasons it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home so it was far enough away that I was away but yet close enough if I ever wanted to go home I could
 Uh Pardon me
 Yeah 
 I lived up at school
 Yeah 
 Uh another reason was uh I paid for my entire education So I had to look for something that I could afford economically
 You know and uh Clarion was oh it was roughly around six thousand a year
 Yeah 
 that was for everything 
 And now I did not go out a lot 
 and I did not order out a lot
 and I you know I did not spend money on myself
 But uh then again I was there for school 
 so 
 Uh and then another reason was I was not sure you know 
 I always wanted to go to school for nursing and then at the last minute I changed my mind
 And I knew that Clarion was known you know for two things 
 actually for their 
 they are known as a teacher's school and also for their business 
 So that's what I ended up going for is for business
 Uh-huh
 No 
 no 
 not yet 
 I am moving shortly 
 so I am not looking around here
 Uh Maryland
 Uh-huh
 My fiancee is down there 
 Yeah 
 he works for the government
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Exactly
 Uh-huh
 Exactly 
 yeah
 It does have a lot of bearing on it whether you are paying for yourself or whether your parents are you know
 Uh yeah 
 because I was paying for it myself I kind of slacked off 
 because I felt it was mine and I could do with it what I wanted
 I think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me you know
 uh they pretty much got to the point 
 well well you know you are at that age 
 and you are going to have to decide what you want to do 
 If you goof up it's your fault 
 it's not ours you know
 And then lets me go 
 and I did not do poorly 
 I finished with a two five 
 that's not that wonderful either
 But uh you know I worked 
 I did not you know goof around 
 I worked
 It was just harder you know 
 I do not know 
 I was used to being you know on top 
 and when I started there it was like you are mediocre 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh wow 
 that's really good
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 See well I screwed myself up also 
 there was a point in time that I decided that I did not want to in school 
 and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do 
 and I said well I am going to go because I have not whipping butter the rest of my life you know
 So I went and I just took business
 well being as I was paying for it myself you know I just kept 
 you do not get into your major until like your second or third year
 And I am going into my third year 
 and I decided well I do not want to do accounting anymore 
 right 
 and I thought oh my God I am paying for this myself 
 I am not switching completely because I will put myself a year behind
 So I switched to finance 
 and I liked it better 
 and I pulled myself from a two oh to a two five you know in my last year my senior year
 But I would have really liked to go on uh secondary ed with math education 
 but it was just the fact I was paying for it myself 
 I was not going to put myself behind another year
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Exactly
 I think if uh I would have went with the math I think I would have done a lot better because I was more interested
 And that's what I I knew that's what I wanted 
 But uh I think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two
 oh my gosh 
 I would like to see the results on a study done 
 I think they would do a lot better Because they are more focused
 They know exactly what they want to do
