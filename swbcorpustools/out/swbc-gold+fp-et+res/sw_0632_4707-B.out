 Not very good 
 it's not been a good day 
 I don't know 
 I finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn 
 so I hope she's turned it in
 Uh I ju- 
 go ahead 
 I'll stop eating 
 I just barely got home from the university
 I just barely got home from the university
 Okay 
 go ahead 
 fire away 
 I agree with you 
 Huh
 I hate the eight and a half percent sales tax 
 But on the other hand I don't mind that it's only on you know things that aren't like groceries and that 
 it's not on that
 Oh yeah 
 they do
 In Arizona
 Uh-huh
 But we have a pretty low income ta- pretty low tax rate here 
 Oh I think the the sales tax they just got to do something about it
 But that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes
 Well and I still think that having lived in Europe for awhile you know difference in living conditions are certainly well worth uh what we pay for it
 Well I think 
 I was in Germany you know for several years
 and I'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have then have to live there
 Higher taxes 
 Yeah
 Still's that way to some extent 
 I think the other problem is you know it it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you theoretically can do something about
 But I look for example 
 and you're not quite in the same situation 
 but like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world 
 I wish I didn't have to pay any more fo- to my physicians in a year than I had to pay for all of my school taxes
 Yeah 
 that that's probably a little tougher on you 
 No 
 I think that's just you though
 Yeah
 Of course I think with the graying of America we're going to see that problem in lots of places
 Or build roads
