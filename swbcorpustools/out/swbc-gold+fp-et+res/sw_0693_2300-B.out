 No 
 we don't
 No 
 I I make so much money here at T I that that we just spend it
 And we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck 
 It's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semi-conductor firm 
 you can just spend it well
 I'm being facetious 
 I'm being very comical 
 Uh we have a budget um that works well 
 I kind of look at it for more of a 
 we have a financial uh analyst a finance administrator I guess that that uh 
 I guess the financial planners the training now 
 We've had it for about four years here
 Got our businesses and and and our life in line how to manage credit cards how to put away say for you know money markets and this kind of thing
 And there's some freebies out there are 
 you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly bring home in some sort of savings account
 That being money market uh bonds savings uh or just a liquid account which which we do 
 Um you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there's a major need for that
 Okay 
 You should always have an umbrella permit that bridges your life insurance and your medical and your uh uh car insurance in case you run into a lawyer and you break his arm 
 He's going to sue the pants off of you 
 These kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year 
 So you know these are all equivalent to the monthly budget things 
 Some of them are there to pacify situations 
 And some of them are there to prevent things from happening
 But uh I guess we kind of got away from about the last sixteen months as far as saying two hundred dollars for food and three hundred dollars for this and two hundred for that because we had a child which is about a year old 
 and then uh we've just been kind of working on 
 I've been developing it 
 but it's kind of hard 
 Diaper prices are going up you know and formula and stuff you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Do you have your uh loans through the Texas Credit Union
 Okay 
 Thing about the credit union is it's the way it's set up is if you have two thousand dollars left let's say on on the loan
 If you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesn't all go towards principal
 They take out for the for the finances the finance charge which is kind of you know 
 it's like one of these lose or swim type of credit 
 one of those loans is Not really the best in the world 
 but But you know they're uh 
 since your husband is is is um a T Ier 
 but doesn't have the loans with the credit union they're offering something that might be worth taking a gander at 
 I don't know what your percent is on your on your car payments
 but they are they'll take any T I non-credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car
 They'll take it and refinance it and put it with Texas Credit Union at I think it's a ten and a quarter percent Which is not a bad deal
 One of the secretaries we have down here is paying twelve percent through G M A C or something
 And she's doing it 
 it's not like it's like 
 I think they even cover that because they want you as a they want the T Ier to be part of the credit union
 Yeah
 Well five years is not that uh five years is not that bad of a problem only because you're paying more interest 
 but your payments are lower
 Oh really
 Sure
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 You save a lot
 If if if if 
 and you need to be very careful 
 if the loan is set up to have bi they call it a yuppie loan if it's set up for bimonthly payments 
 If you 
 because you'll save fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan
 Sev- seven to nine years off the end of the loan
 And there are there is a local firm that'll actually 
 if if 
 like in my situation I don't have that because the loan was not available 
 I can have 
 this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee 
 So I can cut that much off the end of 
 but I'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year
 Yeah 
 But uh those are all great
 The the interesting thing we're getting ready to have a house built
 it's not a lot of the firms that offer 
 mortgage loan firms aren't offering um that loan
 You can ask and you can wheel and deal 
 but it's not as open as it should be 
 It's a great idea 
 Hell I'd love to cut ours in half 
 but uh 
 man 
 And if you figure get with a financial person
 And you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan if you make like a four hundred dollar payment over and above your house payment it'll make uh 
 it has a magic with numbers 
 It I it'll shave almost you know X number of dollars off
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Somebody you trust 
 You know there are so many rip-off artists here in this town 
 It's it's uh it's really a sin 
 it really is
 I got taken on some fire- on firewood 
 uh uh the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood 
 and my wife didn't know 
 and I stopped payment on the check 
 and he'd already been paid by a cashing firm 
 And and they're suing us they're suing me on this 
 and it's for a hundred and thirty-four dollars
 Absolutely pathetic
 Oh okay 
 well 
 probably something like that 
 did you call them and tell them you just you just 
 Might be a good idea because you're going to get what a a check
