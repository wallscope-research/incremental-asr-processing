 Uh yes 
 I think so Uh
 Yeah 
 I don't kn- 
 Yeah 
 I believe that's right
 And uh and I don't know that that's really what we're talking about
 Yeah 
 for for kids in high school it could be in the summertime
 Uh you know um it it could even be done while they're doing another job while they're doing you know a job to make money 
 But uh it's uh you know such a grassroots idea that it 
 I think the family would have to be involved in it
 And people would have to be convinced that you know 
 I I think the the basic message is that giving is better than receiving 
 And that's not the kind of society we have right now
 There's lots and lots of volunteer programs 
 and uh but most of those are at l- least it it's my opinion that most of those involve adults Adults who have the time to give and and uh you know the desire to to give
 It's not uh you know it's not uh 
 maybe the maybe it cou- uh 
 younger people feel like it's not open to them 
 I don't know 
 But it should be if it's not
 Yeah
 it is kind of an introspective time of life
 But some schools some high schools have actually started a program of like a visitation program to uh you know areas economically uh say less advantaged areas 
 And uh they they promote service on the part of the kids to to uh some of those people 
 So at least that's a step in the right direction I guess
 It's really it's really unfortunate because when you do 
 I do volunteer work for the American Lung Association
 And I have have done uh gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society 
 And there's there's no question that doing you know doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than uh than the people involved
 Uh it's it's really a gift to yourself 
 and and that's I think that's a really important lesson to learn
 And and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not uh not really happy you know
 Because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself you're just kind of down the tube you know 
 Uh it really is better to give then to receive
