 Okay
 Yes
 and uh let me tell you 
 this is a really neat thing to do too that they did 
 I didn't do it 
 Some of the other people the older people organized it
 And what they did they had uh a book made up 
 and it was like when our ancestors first came over
 And then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family And like how many kids you had and who you had married 
 and you know it went through like 
 and it showed who my uh well who my husband's parents were you know And who he married and then how many children we had and then like his brothers and sisters 
 and it went through the whole family and stuff
 And it was so good
 Yeah 
 But it it really did 
 you know and plus it's got a lot more people interested in it because you got to participate sort of
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 And everybody got a book that came to the reunion 
 And it told like uh you know where the first Connally's came over
 and um it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had 
 and it just kept coming on up through the generations
 So it was really that was really neat 
 And 
 Well he does 
 He does 
 I don't 
 But uh he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 That's what that's what happened when I when I first uh met my husband 
 I said this can't be you know 
 nobody can have this many relatives
 because a lot of them lived in like a group you know down one highway
 And there was a lake 
 and they all lived down there by it
 And so we were going down the highway you know 
 and he kept saying this is where my uncle lives 
 and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle 
 and I kept thinking this guy is putting me on
 Nobody has this many relatives you know 
 So but they really were all there 
 And another thing that's really good about uh family reunions is having everybody just cook whatever is their specialty and bring it At because nobody it seemed like liked the same thing
 But you had a choice 
 and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too and get a lot of good recipes
 Where if you said a certain thing and say okay we're all going to have fried fish or we're all going to have fried chicken
 Everybody might not like that
 Oh yeah 
 Yeah 
 they came from all over
 Um they just stayed with different ones of them
 They just came down and like say okay this aunt and Uncle Kip uh all their kids and their grand kids and everything 
 and then they had it 
 It had gotten so big that they had it at the church
 And they had a church service ahead of it 
 you know and then they had uh uh then they ate out on the ground
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 But you know what you can do
 A lot of these lakes and things if you could find a centrally located like say about the same distance for all of you all to come
 They have these places where you can rent them 
 and it you know like on a lake
 like uh it's a big place 
 you know it's got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff
 and it's not very expensive that way
 Right 
 It's like a they have like a a convention type thing
 And then it has little rooms off of it where you know you'd go and sleep at night time 
 But then it has like a kitchenette and things like that 
 but you 
 Right
 And another 
 Yeah 
 But they had 
 that was 
 you know that 
 what you can do is you can write different places the Chamber of Commerce tell them what you're interested in
 Ask them what they have you know at area lakes and all If they have something like that 
 because now every time we plan anything just about we write to the Chamber of Commerce of where we're going because you can find out so much easier that way than try to locate it you know
 calling different places can r- really run you up a bill
 But if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance 
 you can't get it exact you know usually 
 but uh and then everybody goes to that place 
 And that is not bad at all
 But they have lot of times they'll have like uh little cabins
 and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have you know just the single bunk beds and stuff
 And they can all stay in those cabins 
 And then you know you can have cookouts and stuff like that 
 that doesn't cost you as much
 Yeah 
 But that's uh you know that's the best way I found because whenever you have something where you go and 
 now we had one 
 this was before I lost a lot more of my family 
 but it wasn't any of my immediate family anyway Because I didn't have any of them left 
 But um they had uh uh thing where you could everybody could come and meet and go out to eat
 But I didn't think that was as good Because it was like you know you couldn't really talk and stuff like you could when you were at the lake or somewhere you know where you were out
 This was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant
 Yeah 
 And it just 
 I didn't like that much
 No
 What they did was Well see what they did was okay they uh they wrote to all the initial people you know the the oldest ones
 Okay 
 then those in turn got a hold of these other ones
 And they had like 
 I think there was four or five different people that would call you know some of them if they didn't have their addresses and all on them 
 and you know they told them that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information we had to tell them how many people were going to be coming you know
 And then when they when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter it uh you know to get the information and all it asked you know will you be willing to bring 
 and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring
 And so really there wasn't any problem with 
 that's the reason it ended up in a church because there was just so many of them 
 But it turned out so much better like that Because everybody knew they knew ahead of time how many people to expect
 Now if there was a sickness or something like that you know you're not going to lose that many
 Right
 Okay well 
 Well see then 
 okay 
 if you wanted them both to come then you would put you would have put that down on the list 
 and you would have sent you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them and ask for their information
 To send back to those other people 
 Right 
 Because once it went to the the oldest people and then they knew who they wanted to invite
 then they sent their little things to us
 Okay 
 it was up to me who I was going to you know whether I wanted my kids and you know my any of my family to come
 So 
 And then you know it never did 
 like if I didn't want somebody to come then I just wouldn't send them one of the questionnaires
 So there really wasn't a problem that way
 Well 
 but I tell you what that's the neatest book we've got
 course we've got we've still got it 
 and they charged us I think it was like it was like five or six dollars I can't remember exactly you know that we paid for the book to be printed
 and it's not uh it's not a hard back book it's just a oh like a you know folder type thing
 But it has the entire 
 you know it has everybody that you could ever imagine and some you couldn't 
 and it will be something my kids will have you know 
 Just like 
 yeah
 Because if you stop and think 
 I don't know if you're like me 
 but I know very little about before my grandparents
 very very little about it
 Yeah
 Maybe what you could do if you couldn't get into a full family reunion and you wanted to go back some 
 but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents then you can find out from you know you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these
