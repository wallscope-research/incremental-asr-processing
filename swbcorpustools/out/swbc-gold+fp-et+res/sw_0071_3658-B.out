 Okay
 Universal health insurance 
 right 
 Uh*[[all 3 utts should be separate slash units]] Well I think universal health insurance like national health like what Canada has Is that what you're you're thinking the subject is about
 Did you read uh the article in the paper today about this particular subject
 Yeah
 Uh the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is uh going to begin testing a program a state funded program for citizens of those two states 
 and there's fourteen other uh states that are considering it Least according to the article in the paper this morning 
 I think it's a trend that's that's that's uh probably may go nationwide eventually because I think national health is something that we all need 
 It's getting to a point that you have to have it 
 you have to have some form of health insurance
 Extremely expensive though
 Uh-huh
 Well that's the thing you know 
 uh unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are are paying for the people that don't have health insurance
 Yeah
 I don't think you uh 
 Yes 
 I do
 Uh through my company 
 yes 
 But I have been in a situation uh recently where I was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year 
 and my wife developed cancer 
 We didn't have any insurance 
 And it was a go to Parkland type situation
 Uh because it was a life threatening situation it was very good 
 Uh as it as it turned out one of the top uh people one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at Parkland
 No 
 it's not free 
 but uh It's it's a situation that because I didn't have any insurance and I was on unemployment it was paid by the county
 I had a bad experience as it turned out 
 Uh I was fortunate that there was Parkland
 Uh no she passed away
 That's all right
 That happens
 Yeah 
 but in any event uh I'm in favor of national health If I had to vote for it
 Oh is that right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I when I grew up and 
 I grew up in south central Kansas uh 
 we had 
 and my mom worked for the health department the county health department 
 and we had x-rays every year 
 we had a dentist come to our school and uh check our teeth once a year at least 
 Uh we had all our flu shots taken care of our measles mumps rubella and all that other stuff
 And uh when my children were growing up we didn't have that 
 We had to pay for it which I wasn't opposed to paying for it 
 I had the money to pay for it 
 but I'm sure that there were people that don't
 Uh-huh
 Did not know that
 Uh-huh
