 You want to go first 
 Okay 
 Uh one of the things they talked about was uh did we d- wh- what do we think about a judge making the decision
 And I really don't agree with that 
 I think that the trial by jury is better uh you know than e- having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible 
 I don't think that they could be objective in every case every time
 Yo- you know what I mean
 Yeah 
 Right
 That's it
 Well I I feel the other thing too uh 
 they were saying uh you know what new ways could y- could it you you know change the system 
 I I really think that uh we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal
 i- if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed If they have been caught you know point blank in the crime There's uh no question 
 it's beyond a reasonable doubt 
 You know all these things 
 you know we've gone through this over and over again
 And it can go on for ten twenty years
 I I think this is a little ridiculous
 I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers
 I I'm serious 
 And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems tha- that exist in the s- in the criminal system today With plea bargaining
 You know if someone is ill 
 Well
 Well I know 
 That's what I'm saying 
 But I think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in in that regard 
 you know people who commit uh crimes that they 
 I don't know how it works exactly 
 but you know they get lesser sentences 
 and I understand that the jails are full of people you know uh and that they have to do something 
 But I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it
 Yo- you know what I'm saying 
 That w- we don't have uh well a lot of states don't have capital punishment
 And uh I I think they should 
 I and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever Like drunk drivers that kill people 
 and uh you know all 
 they they're caught dead to rights 
 I I just think that that's they've they've taken a life 
 and if they should pay for it with their life
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 It uh 
 Yeah
 I know that that 
 Uh-huh 
 And I don't know 
 Uh what would you do to change it To make it better
 Oh yeah 
 I I I don't agree with that at all
 Imagine the guilt that person would have 
 burned out 
 There's there's no possible way that you could uh you know feel good about yourself
 If you had to do something like that day after day
 No 
 Not really
 Well w- do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like 
 supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you
 In other words you're saying that w- you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well I I
