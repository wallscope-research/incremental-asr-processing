 Uh-huh
 Well I uh 
 one girl went in in state and has graduated 
 and then uh that was uh you know that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go
 and I have uh one out of two out of state both in Missouri 
 and um I teach uh in a college 
 and so I they had heard me talk about it and for years that I didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate 
 Uh so that was pretty much uh 
 Oh oh if they if they're content there
 as far as the education as far as looking at the degree at the end that uh it's very little difference is paid to it where you get that bachelor's 
 Uh if it's a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally 
 and if they can get uh um two out of 
 let's see my son got a full total scholarships
 and so there's uh there's plenty of scholarships out there 
 and so people should be advised to look for those 
 and um 
 Uh
 Well they uh 
 I went we went around 
 my son was a graduated from a Jesuit high school
 and so he he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university 
 and so there you know 
 that was limited to five or six different places 
 and um so he's in Saint Louis U 
 and I guess I played a role in that 
 I I just sort of uh let them um you know 
 they'd all been uh pretty efficient as far as studies 
 and uh so I didn't have that much to do 
 they just uh they just knew they wanted to go to college 
 and I you know helped them get there as far as traveling with them to look at different places 
 We did do that 
 and I would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up
 Some people don't do it 
 and then they get there and hate it or whatever 
 so if it's possible
 Right
 I think in the short run it is expensive 
 In the long run it's very uh reasonable if the person 
 my daughter has been in in Missouri for a second year 
 now she's coming home at the end of the semester
 so uh you know she's already twenty-one 
 She started late 
 So that's you know strictly up to her 
 and uh she'll finish down here uh uh finish this year down here and then decide what she's going to do next year
 It'll save me a lot of money because I'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition
 but again that's her decision
 so uh but I have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back 
 and they're much better students at twenty-five twenty-six may twenty-eight 
 So you know I don't I never have pushed them 
 I just say that education is important you should do it uh 
 but uh they have to do the work
 so uh 
 Right
 Yeah
 Oh I think so
 And also I'm opposed to the to the size 
 They've just gotten so huge 
 and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand 
 see that's just too many
 Ended up going to where I used to go 
 and that was twenty-five hundred when I went there 
 it's twenty-one thousand now 
 it's too big
 So 
 Pardon
 It's Southwest Missouri State University
 and uh it was twenty-five hundred when I went there forty years ago 
 and uh my son's in a school about seven thousand 
 and that's that's not bad
 I teach in a school about eight thousand 
 and that's that's even a little large
 but it's much better than twenty-one thousand 
 But they do have to visit and if if the parent can point out all the different places to look for for scholarships 
 and then oh those rating uh 
 the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything 
 I don't think it hurts to look at them
 I don't put that much stock in them 
 but 
 probably fine just to compare
 Right
 If they you know uh they need to
