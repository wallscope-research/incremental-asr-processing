 Well what movies have you seen recently Valerie
 Oh we haven't seen that one yet
 Oh it wasn't that good
 The most recent one that uh my wife and I have seen was the CITY SLICKER
 That was excellent 
 It was just a really a really funny movie 
 At the same time it had a story line about people trying to find themselves 
 There were parts that were sad 
 it just ran the gamut of emotion
 And but it was just enter- all around entertaining 
 Uh it's still on to the best of my knowledge
 Oh
 Uh it's I think it's less than two hours
 We we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever 
 Yeah 
 but this one it was fairly long 
 I I'm guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes maybe
 But excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby
 uh who was the 
 oh Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy
 So we really enjoyed that
 Yeah 
 I think that uh I can highly recommend that movie this to see
 Yeah
 Uh we generally rent a couple a week 
 Uh in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend you've got to rent it on Thursday
 They get they get taken up at the store 
 so 
 We will rent two or three movies on Thursday 
 and uh with luck you'll have one or two that are good
 Most of them are a coin flip 
 Yeah
 Yeah well
 Quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends
 and uh we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see 
 and Uh Uh generally try to stay in the at least P G range
 The uh the oldest is nine 
 the youngest is three 
 He doesn't really pay attention
 The five year old doesn't have the attention span either
 But the the nine year old will watch anything that's on T V 
 So 
 Yeah 
 my wife took uh I think the kids to see that one 
 but we can generally find something at the store for them to watch
 The 
 uh oh we saw this movie 
 PRESUMED INNOCENT was the one we rented uh last weekend
 Harrison Ford
 It's uh he is a prosecuting attorney 
 and uh another prosecutor in the a woman prosecutor in there is murdered
 and he's trying to find it 
 but course it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her 
 so it's And it's an extremely long movie 
 It's it's over two hours long
 Which 
 uh my wife enj- she likes the suspense movies 
 I enjoy them to a degree
 Save that for another day
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think you it's uh it's something I think you would enjoy 
 yes
 It it's like most suspense movies 
 what was 
 it was on T V recently uh FATAL ATTRACTION
 It's one that once you've seen it once and uh the suspense there is not really you really can't see it again
 so you know all the story and who did what and when it happened 
 so once once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that then it's it's not good for a second watching particularly
 At least I don't think so 
 I don't know 
 we've watched WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S any number of times 
 It's just slapstick comedy 
 Sit there and laugh 
 and my one grandson and I 
 my wife can't understand it 
 but we like BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE which is another funny one 
 Yeah 
 we like to laugh 
 I I have a theory 
 I like movies for entertainment 
 I don't want to uh go away depressed from watching a movie
 Life's depressing enough 
 Well I've certainly enjoyed talking with you
 Okay 
 bye
 Have a nice weekend
 Okay
 Bye
