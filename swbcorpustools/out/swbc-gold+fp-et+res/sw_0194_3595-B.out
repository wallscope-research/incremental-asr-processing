 Is that right 
 Well I never thought about that 
 but there is an Arlington 
 like I had a call the other day from Birmingham Michigan you know 
 and I was thinking yeah and I was thinking 
 the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama
 Yeah 
 well tell me what kind of books have you read
 I was going to say not fun kind right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it is 
 because you know that's it's really and truly a true thing 
 You know I read one about Bob Hope that I liked
 Yeah 
 that was real good 
 I'm like you 
 if it's not a heavy biography you know I enjoy it
 I was trying to think uh 
 I read a uh a novel that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and all 
 and there was a murder
 Yeah 
 it was some time ago 
 Seems like it was THE SPY WENT DANCING or something like that
 It was a lot of fun because they used these real names you know
 Yeah 
 in fact I believe it was 
 because 
 Uh-huh 
 I believe
 Yeah 
 I think it was by her now + that you mention it because someone had given it to me 
 and I thought well this will be great 
 and it was
 Uh-huh
 Well when you use real people like that I think royalty especially you know 
 Yeah 
 but you know that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth you know
 Our movie stars 
 because it's totally different concept to us
 I haven't I haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either 
 I have read uh mostly novels 
 I went to visit my daughter in Florida
 and I took a novel with me uh and read it at Thanksgiving time 
 and uh it was uh one of those generation novels you know
 starts out when they're small and continues through generations
 and I like that
 Yes 
 I have
 Oh she is wonderful
 I stayed up one night I think until two in the morning finishing one of hers because I star- I could not put it down
 Well no 
 it seems like she doesn't write as often as oh well like Danielle Steele and those silly things 
 She writes the same thing
 Yeah 
 and and they're the same silly things 
 if you've read one I mean it's It it's practically the same thing over and over you know
 Yeah 
 wouldn't I you know 
 I'm criticizing her 
 and wouldn't I like to have her money
 because they go from hardback to paperback 
 and she has millions of them
 Uh-huh 
 You know mini series and so forth 
 and it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often 
 I have not seen as many of hers
 Uh-huh
 I think she does a lot of research too
 Huh-uh
 No 
 I don't think so 
 and I've often wondered why haven't you
 You know I 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them you know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 And maybe that turns people off 
 but look at GONE WITH THE WIND you know
 Uh have you uh gotten into SCARLETT yet
 Yeah 
 that's exactly what I was going to say 
 I was amazed 
 because I 
 in the beginning when it was on you know on route coming out I heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad 
 and then when it came out all I heard was just oh how bad it was that I didn't even want to get it
 Huh-uh
 No
 Well it wouldn't surprise me
