 Okay 
 Where to start
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's true 
 I didn't think about that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I agree 
 Yes 
 I get some of these things in the mail that I wonder where in the world did they get my address or where did they get my name 
 And in fact some of these things I get some of these questionnaires 
 it's funny because I'm I was in the process of filling one out when I decided I would make this phone call 
 but uh I haven't got to the end of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything 
 but when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it your salary information I I just have a real hard time doing that uh 
 and they ask you what type of household items do you own like stereos and T Vs and V C Rs 
 and and you hate to send something off with your name and address 
 and what types of things do you own 
 and what kind of money do you make 
 and you wonder well who's going to get ahold of this and think um that's a nice place to go rob 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I got one tonight about six thirty when I sat down to eat dinner 
 carpet cleaning 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh no 
 Right
 Yeah
 I think I dislike the phone number part the worst 
 it's it's one thing to get junk mail because you can you can just put it right in the trash 
 but it's the phone calls 
 and you know usually when they call you it's going to be when you s- right when you sit down to dinner because they know they pretty much know that you're at work all day 
 and they call you right when when you've just gotten home from work 
 The last thing you want is a phone call unless it's you know something halfway enjoyable 
 but if it's a salesperson it's just something you don't want to have to mess with 
 And and I've gotten a lot of them lately 
 or I'll 
 sometimes I come home from work 
 and there's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine 
 and I'm just assuming it's probably a salesman that called during the day 
 and I wasn't home 
 and they'll probably call me up and you know call me back and bother me when I sit down to dinner later on 
 but I find that very annoying The uh mail stuff 
 yeah you know 
 it's kind of irritating 
 but it's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls
 *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh oh
 *[[slash error]] Right
 *[[slash error]] Uh-huh 
 I agree with the phone too in that I'm single 
 but when I come home from work there's times I need to pay bills 
 I need to balance my checking account 
 I need to do all kinds of different things like that 
 and even though it's friends calling sometimes you just feel like this is my quiet time 
 I need to get things done 
 and the phone ringing bothers me 
 but that's that's where answering machines are nice because if it's really important they'll leave a message 
 and I can call them back 
 But uh at work I have so many phone calls from customers calling in 
 sometimes it is just I just want to get away from the phone ringing because it it really does annoy me 
 And uh if I've had a lot of phone calls during the day when occasionally when we have uh 
 like this past week 
 we have to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system 
 and uh phone rings like crazy 
 and you come home 
 and the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone 
 And if it's some salesman that just makes it even that much worse 
 And uh it just 
 I get to where I I turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone 
 but now with this thing I'm participating in I kind of have to answer it because you never know if it's the switchboard or if it's uh you know somebody calling that you really don't want to talk on the phone
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 A ring at all
 Oh huh 
 That's an idea 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Ours is that way too
 Uh-huh
 Well yours is probably the same as ours 
 It's uh Tigon 
 isn't Tigon uh part of G T E or vice versa or something like that
 Seems I read 
 Okay
 Okay 
 that's it 
 that G T E had purchased Tigon 
 and 
 Yeah 
 that's what we have
 Aspen
 Huh 
 I couldn't remember in Tigon had purchased G T Es phone mail services or if G T E had purchased Tigon 
 I knew there was some type of a tie in there 
 I remember reading in the paper a few months back 
 but 
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh no
 I think we did
 that's good 
 I didn't think we could go too far on this privacy thing 
 but uh I guess it's close enough 
 Sure good talking to you Jim
 All right 
 Bye-bye
