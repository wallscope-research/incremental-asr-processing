 Would you then go ha- hiking 
 would the camping be part of a long hike
 Um
 Were you up in in Wisconsin 
 or would you go into Can- 
 where would you camp 
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 That's beautiful 
 Right 
 Oh yeah 
 Well most of my camping 
 I haven't done much since I was a kid
 but uh we'd basically take the tent up in the Sierras and uh usually just camp near some stream or some lake
 And uh just 
 it wasn't even a a full tent 
 It would be more a tarp uh strung up between trees 
 and my dad would take uh four kids My brother and myself and two cousins
 and uh we just thought it was absolute heaven
 Uh there was certainly nothing like a a bathroom a shower or anything near by 
 It was dig your own hole 
 and uh and I I'm not sure I'd do that that anymore 
 but it's it uh uh 
 actually some friends of mine and I are planning to camp this summer uh for four days 
 Also going fishing uh
 and I have a idea it's going to be a a lot more equipment and a lot more stuff than before 
 Yeah 
 But 
 Yeah
 Oh my 
 Uh-huh
