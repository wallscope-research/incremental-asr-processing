 Do you uh have a family budget 
 or how do you work your budgeting
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh well we don't have a real strict budget 
 Uh we have a a low budget to work on 
 but we uh you know 
 for like groceries we say about this much per week 
 and then we just spend about so much 
 We don't I I don't know of a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything 
 but I know that I go to the grocery store that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there
 A certain amount
 Yeah
 Oh
 Wow 
 that's great
 Oh
 Oh you guys sound pretty self sufficient 
 Huh
 Yeah
 Well that's a good idea
 Let's see 
 the other thing there the topic was talking about was if if uh 
 all I can think of is if you don't keep a real a real tight budget how do you control expenses 
 but uh one 
 another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas 
 Well not fly back 
 but somehow we get back there
 And uh this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive 
 and 
 Huh
 Oh yeah
 And uh you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare 
 And so uh we find that if we're careful with our you know just everyday things like grocery shopping and and gas and entertainment things like that then uh somewhere in out in the wash it will come out that we have enough to get back there You know
 Uh-huh 
 that's all right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 that's right
 Yeah 
 well whenever 
 I don't know if this is part of the topic 
 but whenever I find you know a dime or something on the ground I I'll probably pick it up 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I have a special little jar that I keep all the money I found in 
 You know just count it up at the end of the year something
 But yeah
 Uh-huh
