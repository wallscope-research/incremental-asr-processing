 So do you your privacy being invaded at any time
 Well yo- 
 Right
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Now th- that y- s- you can still yeah 
 I've always done that 
 I started 
 once I found out that that's really not necessary or legal then I just refuse 
 and I say what are you going to do 
 You going to say you don't want to sell me this product then that's fine 
 I'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all 
 And then ultimately they say no 
 you don't have to put it down 
 But uh really it's part of this compliance thing
 Uh the thing I don't like 
 I know that certain states actually sell their uh their lists like uh motor vehicles
 That really burns me because hey you're required 
 You have to do that
 And nowhere does it say you h- asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone
 And I think that it it's one thing f- to uh voluntarily give it because someone asks 
 You can always refuse 
 but it's another thing where it's required by law 
 and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody You know 
 I don't think I don't think they have the right to do that
 Well that's easy 
 Whenever you donate money to someone
 They you become put on something like a sucker list 
 and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations 
 And then you s- y- y- 
 it kind of makes you feel from doing it again
 Like uh National Public Radio or any of these the public uh stations you know
 I I I I think I sent in in money for f- once to uh to public uh T V
 And I started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine 
 I 
 it's like 
 and it just started soon after I had done that one
 And I just said this is this is terrible 
 Uh and that's also happened to me where I've given money to my old Alma Mater in college
 And uh it's one thing 
 they don't sell the list 
 But the thing that makes me mad is uh then they start getting uh other people 
 th- the people do these phonathons
 and they call you up 
 and they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that 
 And and they say oh we we know you 
 You uh had uh contributed x amount last year 
 Can you do better this year 
 And you know like hold on here
 Who how do you know that 
 Why why you even telling me this 
 Is it any of your business 
 it's one thing that I and the college knows that 
 that's just our business 
 There's no need for someone who is soliciting should know at all 
 Just uh 
 and that was very offensive too 
 I 
 and so <> 
 Uh-huh
 Right
