 Uh actually my last vacation was in Connecticut 
 Uh we went home to visit family 
 Before that we were in Hawaii
 Oh
 It wasn't actually 
 It 
 w- when we were in Oah- Oahu uh I couldn't wait to get off 
 We we took a cruise 
 and we went to four different islands 
 and it was a really nice 
 Kauai was nice and Maui was nice 
 We had we had a great time
 We were there for ten days

 Uh-huh 
 I was born in Saudi Arabia 
 and uh when my father worked there we they used to travel quite a bit all around you know in in Europe and whatnot 
 but I was very young 
 so I don't remember that 
 and I was three when we moved back here
 So I don't remember 
 but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been 
 and that I was when I was a baby 
 but so Morocco I think would be wonderful 
 because that's you know that's that area of the world I think would be great
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Really
 We we found that in Jamaica 
 It was the same way that people would come up and try and sell you well try and sell drugs and things like that 
 but they they were so destitute 
 and I guess they they make all their money on tourism 
 and and they would come up and ask you you know if if you want to buy different things 
 and really after awhile it really gets annoying
 you know it it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
