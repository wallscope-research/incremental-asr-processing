 Well mostly uh a a little fresh water fish 
 but mostly lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because I used to live in Utah
 But uh down here I haven't fished much in Texas
 Oh they're really not 
 I think they're good to eat
 Oh just usually worms night crawlers 
 Sometimes fish eggs
 Sometimes <>
 Yeah
 Just little just little fish eggs
 And uh there's this one kind of cheese that you can put on the end of a hook 
 and it will stay relatively well 
 Yeah
 and and they really like that
 Now I have never caught catfish
 Uh-huh
 Because they fight the best <> 
 Oh is that right
 Now in Amarillo did you fish any of this 
 Um Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh how about that
 Oh
 Oh I think that is really interesting
 Uh-huh
 I think they're 
 see and I wish I could go fishing here because I don't really know much about the fishing here 
 I guess it would 
 if you did it like you were just uh saying that's pretty much like rainbow trout
 You bait the hook 
 you throw it in 
 you troll it a little bit 
 and then you wait
 and they troll it a little bit
 No 
 I don't <>
 Yeah
 Oh uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 You are now
 I've never used those 
 That's really interesting
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh what kind of fish do you like the best to eat
 Oh do you 
 Um Yes 
 I've done fishing like that 
 but but uh tell me what uh where you'd catch crappie 
 My my neighbor has gone before and and done that 
 but 
 Oh oh I know
 Uh they're sort of like well I want to say flies 
 but not exactly like 
 Yeah
 The yellow
 Okay 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 my mom she just loves to fish 
 and she has a lot of those those little uh 
 they almost look neon 
 You know they're just real color- colorful things on onto her end
 Yeah 
 And she d- she's really a good fisher woman
 Yeah
 Well you sound like you're a good fisher woman too
