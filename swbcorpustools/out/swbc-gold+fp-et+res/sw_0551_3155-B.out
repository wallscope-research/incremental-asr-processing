 Oh well that's 
 we rent a lot of videos too 
 Uh we saw 
 I have two little babies 
 and we saw one movie recently 
 and that was THE TERMINATOR movie uh which I didn't like after all 
 Well I don't either 
 It 
 on all the the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie 
 He doesn't 
 He maims them 
 So
 Uh-huh 
 He he uh I think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part In the movie
 So
 Oh I haven't seen that one yet
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Yeah 
 well With all the commercials and everything 
 I haven't 
 that's one we want to see 
 I I want to see uh DANCES WITH WOLVES
 But we haven't seen that one yet either
 Yeah 
 th- that's what I heard too 
 Yeah 
 we've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it 
 So *[[slash error]] We saw uh the the uh movie with uh Sylvester Stallone OSCAR
 Supposed to be his uh his debut in comedy
 Which was an interesting movie but not very funny
 Did she
 Well it was it was an amusing movie
 It j- 
 I guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to uh just at the house watching it with with no one else around
 So 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 My son just turned two 
 and so THE LITTLE MERMAID is now our favorite movie
 LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN I think are are his two favorites that we've got 
 Oh I haven't I didn't hear that was coming out
 Well they just had uh THE RESCUERS movie
 that was a Disney movie wasn't it 
 I think I heard that was just one was just out 
 He's uh he doesn't sit still for the whole movie yet 
 but he likes to uh to listen to the music and stuff if there's a lot of that in the m- in the movie 
 Well I w- tell you ever s- 
 my my kids are just small babies 
 and I tell you we really want to go a lot 
 and uh there's so much out on video now that it's almost you know 
 the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it Sometimes
 So
 Uh-huh 
 That seems to happen 
 I noticed that DANCES WITH WOLVES was playing at the uh Granada Theater
 And uh someone said that was a lot of fun to go do 
 You can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie 
 I thought that might be kind of fun to do
 And of course you need a baby-sitter for that 
 Definitely 
 But uh no 
 I'd really like to get out to the movies more often 
 Course it's so expensive now too that you can't hardly afford it 
 I I know we get discount tickets where my husband works 
 but other than that it just seems like it's so expensive 
 And then the popcorn and everything else 
 you almost can't afford to do it No matter what 
 Although we did actually get 
 we went on vacation couple months ago 
 and we got to go see WHAT ABOUT BOB
 That was kind of a funny movie with uh Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray
 That was fun
 Oh he's a Richard Dreyfuss is a uh psychiatrist 
 and Bob is his patient 
 and Bob follows him on vacation 
 It's uh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's the one
 Must have left an impression
