 Se- late sixties seventies uh
 Greatful Dead Crosby Stills and Nash
 What 
 Oh I've heard a little bit of it 
 I've just 
 Uh now I've heard of Striper 
 So the only one I can

 No 
 they're they are still on tour 
 They have been touring since the late sixties 
 No
 They're still together 
 They're still making albums
 Uh-huh
 Uh
 In fact there are people you know that basically just follow them around from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that 
 Uh
 Yeah 
 they're they're like late forties early fifties 
 but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement 
 You know they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players 
 They keep on dying 
 and they keep on replacing them 
 and the new ones in this thirties you know Uh
 But uh 
 Yeah 
 <> Well they don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones 
 They just 
 I don't know if you saw the tour posters of the Rolling Stones when they last toured 
 but it looked like leather day at the geriatric
 All their faces were just all shriveled
 Uh-huh
 it just just looked like they got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans
 Well uh 
 Actually I prefer my my performers to be pretty sober you know just uh just so that you know that if they're jamming you know that they don't just lose themselves and you know go into lala land
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 So uh have you seen any concerts lately
