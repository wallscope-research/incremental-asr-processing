 Hello
 Hi
 I'm Sandy 
 I'm in Texas too
 Oh really
 Yes
 Yeah
 Okay
 Yeah
 So am I
 You know I think it's kind of coming back around to that don't you 
 that there's a lot more people that stay home now than before 
 but I guess more than anything I think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do you know
 I don't know 
 I think sometimes some of the the women's lib though is kind of like they wanted it all you know 
 and you can't have everything
 I don't I don't think that you can have there's no way I could have a career and then be the kind of mom that I want to be
 and to me that's more important
 Two
 Uh-huh
 Five and two
 Well I agree 
 but I I hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work too saying you know you should stay home you know otherwise your children aren't going to you know turn out or whatever because that's not fair to you know like the single moms that have to work 
 or if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet not working or whatever 
 I think it's got to be a personal choice 
 and it's nice that that we could have the choice to stay home
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well and I think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or you know even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff 
 and I think that's really important that that they do that 
 and they realize there's a need for that 
 and um I don't know 
 I found when I did do some work when my son was young it was like contract work 
 and it wasn't where I had to be there every day 
 but we were going to the doctor once a week 
 so I don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor
