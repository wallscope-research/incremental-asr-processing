 Um actually quite a a a while 
 Um I've lived here for six years 
 and can you hold on just a second 
 Hello
 Oh I'm sorry 
 I must have got the other line cut off 
 Uh so they've been doing that it for a while now
 and uh it 
 I live in an apartment
 and my ap- <> facilities 
 there it is 
 hold on <>
 <> Okay 
 sorry about that 
 Yeah 
 Uh anyhow they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only 
 Uh I've been recycling for maybe about two years now and at ano- ano- another public facility where they have you know recycling of glass uh aluminum and paper 
 Now 
 No 
 and that's what I I don't understand exactly why they don't have that option
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 now an additional thing is uh 
 where I work they also have recycling there of uh all white paper and of you know cans also
 so a lot of people you know right at the vending machines they have receptacles that you know you can just pop your cans in 
 and near the Xerox machines they have places you know for your paper 
 you know I keep a little box at my desk you know
 and I just throw as I'm using the white paper you know I just throw it right in there
 and then you know they have someone that comes around and pick it up you know every afternoon which you know is an excellent idea at work because I know the amount paper they go through there 
 because 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I would agree with that 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Exactly 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I agree with you there 
 another thing that I like here which is 
 I do with 
 I have to actually go to two different recycling areas because one of them is that uh 
 their aluminum cans is for uh Children's Hospital for a burn fund
 so all the monies are donated you know for the recycling to Children's Hospital which I think is an excellent idea there you know because the other public 
 Right 
 right
 and before even at work 
 before they started the recycling plan which at work they've only been doing since January first of this year I had had everyone in my department recycling 
 and you know I would have them drop right drop their cans off in my office 
 and then I would haul them you know here to this place for the Children's Hospital Fund which got people really going into it
 but 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 That 
 there you go
 That's for sure
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 right 
 Uh-huh 
 and I'm sure you know in the near future I would think they would be coming out with more
 you know I've seen a definite trend you know towards more recycling everywhere you know even at McDonald's you know with their their use of no foam containers anymore 
 Right 
 I think I think it is getting more you know advertisement
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 Okay 
 well I did too
 Okay 
 Bye-bye <>
