 Well 
 Yeah 
 uh I guess I basically agree that uh 
 do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs 
 suppose they found out some other way 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 But have you ever been in a situation where you you were drug tested 
 or 
 Yeah
 I once too 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I had it during a job interview 
 and I just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them to do this 
 and I'm just like well uh I'm not even going to think much about it if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before you've gotten to know me
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well like you say if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors
 And if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons
 Yeah
 Well do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this 
 or 
 Yeah
 I tend to to view it 
 even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that I sort of want to defend an employer's rights as opposed to an in- uh in addition to an individual's rights 
 but an employer really I think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to
 and if they say they don't want smokers I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that
 Uh and I don't really
