 Okay 
 well um let's see 
 I I think there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard 
 and you know there's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States 
 and that you know 
 their yo- votes not going to make that much difference 
 and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you know what you believe in 
 and that person is going to have a lot of uh 
 since there's so many issues this one person can believe a lot of different ways on all of them 
 so it would be really difficult to have that one pers- perfect person that believed exactly what you believed
 Yeah
 Right 
 yeah
 that's good
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 there's uh a lot of extremes on the parties too with the you know the real uh far side of the Democrats 
 they're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um the Democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of 
 it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like uh moral standings and those kinds of things
 But 
 Uh-huh <>
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 That's that's true 
 I think in uh the Texas governor elections I think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time
 Oh really
 Right
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Yeah 
 that's true that the different places in America that uh you know different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place
 Uh-huh <>
 Right 
 Yeah 
 and it's uh real true that uh you know they'll say one thing to get elected 
 and then once they do get elected they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand
 You know maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing 
 You know that's uh 
 with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to even try to do
 Right 
 Right 
 after the war
 That really uh 
 Uh that's true 
 yeah
 Right 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 that's 
 you know neither has mine as a matter of fact 
 And uh that's true 
 they I think they look at it as well everybody the majority of the people think this way when that's not necessarily true because you know that's what the media says 
 Well the majority believes this way 
 so uh they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their uh opinions 
 So that's that's true
 Yeah 
 Do you hear the dogs in the background here
 Okay 
 they're 
 the children next door just opened the fence 
 and they went off
 Yeah 
 But anyway that's 
 I guess we've uh talked long enough
