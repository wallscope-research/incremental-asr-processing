 Okay 
 You think you're getting your money's worth
 Well that's probably the next year's agenda
 Oh yeah 
 They're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around 
 and I I think one way or the other we're going to pay for the bureaucracy I guess 
 Uh it's one area that is really I I think hurting the economy more than anything 
 I think the taxes have just every time you turn around they they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products 
 and I I I think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now
 That's right
 That's right
 Yep 
 that's right
 Well I think that uh that the problem with the sales tax of course is it's an unfair tax across the board uh as far as ability to pay which a- allegedly allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards 
 But uh now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of you know taxes on everything they buy and where people that make you know two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they aren't going to be paying taxes on you know 
 And uh that's the unfair equity inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue 
 but I don't think it is anymore not in Texas anyway
 That's right 
 that's right 
 That's right 
 that's right 
 And that's the unfairness of the thing 
 but uh I think taxes generally are unfair 
 so 
 Well you know like other things if they don't affect you you don't worry about them too much
 I have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still 
 so it doesn't 
 I I think uh you know generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is uh you know 
 And uh I guess if people got thirty forty thousand bucks to spend on a car uh that's their prerogative you know 
 I I I don't have a whole of sympathy on that 
 You maybe you buy that you know 
 and I don't mean to be knocking uh 
 Yeah 
 there are 
 there are 
 And the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that I guess you know unless they really want it buy something that you know 
 more well it it's just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids you know 
 It's a way of increasing the population that that was one of the initial ideas of you know giving exemptions on kids on on federal taxes
 And where you exempt things like uh uh one of the best things I heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably Lloyd Bentsen said that all you know if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be you know spending more money using their credit cards
 Now I don't know if that's true or not 
 but if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and you know a- any kind of interest that you're paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers
 So that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go you know tax things that they don't you know to a degree well like booze you know 
 example they keep raising the taxes on booze 
 it gets to the point you know it makes drunks sober you know 
 They quit buying it
