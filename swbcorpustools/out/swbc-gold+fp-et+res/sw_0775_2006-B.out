 Right
 Me I'm in the legal department 
 and um we do have uh a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues
 And I don't know too much about the air pollution thing 
 I do know for other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that T I has to dispose of that we normally put in the ground you know we're coming up with a uh a new solution 
 We have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump 
 and we just transport to these places 
 But after awhile it always seems that the um oh the site starts to leak 
 and then you have to clean it up and such 
 But the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman 
 and we're going have that you know incineration place up there and dump everything there 
 And supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what I've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up 
 And that we won't be polluting the air 
 I'm sure we have to have uh permits you know for that place And that there's you know limits as to what we can uh let you know go into the air
 Oh okay
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Um
 Now is that place built 
 or you're still on the makings of it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well I know from some of the sites that we've had uh quite a list of cites that have gone bad 
 and you have to clean up 
 And you know the law now is the super fund 
 and anybody who's contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually you know uh damaged the ground or not 
 Uh everybody has to contribute 
 and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've gotten uh gotten pulled into these super fund deals to clean it up and you know mega bucks to uh you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area 
 and um certainly it would to have a better solution like the Sherman facility than um just letting it go in the ground 
 Because eventually you know it it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area 
 It still only in time starts to leak out
 Yeah
 There there was one site that they cleaned up 
 and then the new place leaked again 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Um
 Yeah
 Oh you were
 Oh okay
 Yes 
 Yes 
 It's a heck of a lot different 
 And we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk 
 We were about the only place in you know T I that had the gray metal desk 
 People used to come and laugh and go gee I hadn't seen one of those ten fifteen years
 We finally got a little respect 
 Nobody thought of us as a profit center before
 Right 
 Right
 Not just overhead
 You too
 Bye
