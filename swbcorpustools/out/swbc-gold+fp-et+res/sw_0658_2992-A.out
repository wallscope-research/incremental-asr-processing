 Well I know that uh 
 I have only like two or three favorite television shows
 I think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen is it Brochco who does like L A LAW
 uh-huh 
 and uh he also did HILLSTREET BLUES
 I like those type of shows
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah 
 me too 
 I know 
 they uh I think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the re runs in the middle of the season
 and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns they start showing some of their newer stuff
 So I thought that was really interesting the way that they did that 
 Oh and so you must watch a lot of uh Disney or cartoons then
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Oh that's true 
 that's true 
 Well I noticed that my kids are uh older now 
 they're uh getting close to the teenage years 
 But they did 
 we watched all of MISTER ROGERS and everything 
 but even some of your uh cartoons can be very violent
 and you know they talk about death 
 and we were watching uh oh gosh BUGS BUNNY just last night
 and um I think it was on I have to remember which channel 
 but anyway uh we were watching that 
 and it was talking about opera 
 and they showed like what they thought an opera would be 
 and one of the things was to kill the rabbit kill the rabbit 
 and I thought Oh how violent you know to kill the rabbit 
 So he ended up killing the rabbit in the end uh 
 but then of course the rabbit comes back to life and says well see this is how an opera is supposed to be 
 And I thought gee whiz if a little kid was watching this you know that would be pretty violent even for a small child
 Uh-huh
 Right
 That's right
 That's right 
 Well I don't think cartoons portray that 
 but like 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 A cat has nine lives
 but they don't 
 they just have one like we do 
 Oh so that's really funny 
 but uh we've gotten 
 uh-huh 
 go ahead
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Yes 
 yeah 
 that's true 
 that's a good show 
 I used to watch uh DALLAS 
 I don't I don't know where you're at *[[should be slash unit because B orients to it and following utt by A couldn't be made without info from B]] Dallas 
 yeah 
 I used to watch DALLAS years ago 
 And somewhere in the middle I got uh bored 
 and uh so I in fact I didn't even watch the finale 
 Uh you know that's about how disinterested I had become
 Uh-huh
 Well actual- 
 uh-huh
 Yep
 Yep 
 I know 
 I know 
 Was it actually based on a book
 Oh but you were just talking about 
 okay 
 okay
 Yeah 
 right
 That's true 
 that's true
 Stay 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 You know and if you notice on DALLAS they lost all the women
 Yes 
 So the men mainly stayed 
 but the women were the ones who left 
 and I thought that was very interesting and wondered kind of wondered about that 
 Uh well anyway that's a whole new issue 
 Oh goodness 
 so Anyway I don't know if our five minutes are over yet 
 But we uh we also have the paid uh television channels 
 Uh the only thing I don't like about it especially with teenagers is that all the violence the sex the nudity and the curse words you know 
 And so I know they didn't pick up these curse words from me 
 So uh they had to have picked them up from uh the T V
 One nice thing though about the cable company we use they have uh they have that little parental uh uh key
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 uh-huh 
 So I I have that at home 
 and I keep the keys with me
 And that's about the only way that I can that I can do it 
 Because their natural curiosity you know to go towards that way and want 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 That's true 
 well and here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high
 Well it was nice talking to you
 Okay 
 talk with you later
 Good-bye
