 Well what do you think about the everyday occurrences that are that are an invasion of your privacy
 Oh
 Right
 Yeah 
 I think that's that's the only thing I wrote down also 
 because that's just a it's terrible today 
 my wife and I seems like we get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and rings up until ten eleven o'clock sometimes
 Yes 
 I know 
 that's true
 Yeah 
 that's true
 But you know people 
 it's like your name must be on a list or something because I know at my office I get calls I must get at least I probably average at least a call a day 
 and a lot of days I'll get two and three calls from from people selling insurance you know to the small business man
 and uh you know I think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your according to what I understand Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names your name out to people also 
 as far as brokers all I get calls from brokers in New York 
 and uh California always trying to sell something oil oil investments or stock investments or whatever 
 And now I'm getting the same calls at ho- at the house 
 And they get your and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet 
 and uh credit card companies they sell your name
 I know Yes
 American Express does that by the way
 Yeah 
 I understand they sell it you know they sell names because it's quite profitable to them
 And that is an invasion of privacy 
 you're right
 I know 
 that's true
 Exactly 
 magazine companies uh uh from from subscriptions do the same thing
 it's the way they make additional money
 But it's uh you know I guess it uh 
 you have to be a certain income holder to uh have an American Express card 
 so your name is valuable to I guess X amount of solicitors calling
 So I don't know 
 What what do you where are you from
 Oh okay 
 well so 
 yeah 
 we live in the Dallas area Richardson 
 Okay 
 Did you
 Yeah 
 I got I've talked to people in Utah people in New York
 and a lot of times I'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning 
 and I'll get people you know from out of the uh out of the state
 I'll be darned 
 Where you from 
 Not from Texas 
 New Jersey 
 right 
 Yeah
 My wife's from New Jersey
 Yeah 
 from uh Saddle River
 She 
 Okay 
 Well that's nice too
 Really 
 yes 
 my wife's been away for twenty-five years 
 so she's been away for quite a while
 Her dad was from Little Rock Arkansas 
 and her mother was from New York 
 so they just they over there in New Jersey 
 Uh and anyway this topic is is a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy 
 but that's the the biggest one I can think of is just just all the solicitors calling 
 I know
 That's a that's a good suggestion 
 I might start using the answering machine more because it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings
 Right
 Sure
 Yeah 
 you're probably right
 I understand 
 I 
 it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriffs associations 
 and 
 I know 
 they call you one time to send three kids to the car- carnival or circus 
 and 
 Right 
 There's always a dif- 
 and I my my pat answer now is well you just called me the other night
