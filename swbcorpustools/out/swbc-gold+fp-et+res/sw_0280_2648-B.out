 Right
 I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that I just uh I think they put off so much 
 and they're not regulated enough
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 No
 Really
 Huh
 Oh
 Right
 I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury could would the even had chem- + you know well 
 those chemicals would not 
 Yeah
 Right 
 yeah
 Right 
 you know like in In packaging 
 and uh you know just goodness 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh only thing I can think is bleaching 
 but I I don't know what's how they do the flour
 But um we we're on the southwest side of Houston 
 we don't have that much as far as uh aiming in the plants over on this uh the we- east side does
 We've got Imperial sugar 
 but uh and they're you know they're right there on the creek also 
 and uh they've been there for years
 And uh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 I know that 
 I worry every now and then 
 we're still on a well water 
 we're not on city water
 and I think well what if somebody's dumped something back there in the and no one knows about it and you know it sinked in through the ground and all that
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh okay 
 okay
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 It will
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 and the gr- 
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 and the the ground will filter some of it but not all of it
 These are well fed 
 These are 
 Good grief these are well fed cows uh 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh
 Oh now that's bad
 Oh I was going to say the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 right 
 And then cutting the trees you know that bothers me
 As far as you know the 
 yes 
 uh we've been wanting to 
 well not me 
 but uh it's been recommend- suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here 
 I'm like no 
 you know for what's cut down here you know more will be cut down someplace else 
 and it will just take that longer to grow back
 and trees help so that uh 
 <> I don't 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right 
 believe me it's just so much better
 So uh yeah 
 I knew 
 I think there's lots that be that could be done to to improve how things are done now
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
