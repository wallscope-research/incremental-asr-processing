 Um well I guess first of all I I could have asked that before
 Do you have children
 No 
 Okay 
 Because I I didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt 
 Um what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two 
 Yeah
 I just um 
 I guess that's my that's something that my family has always believed strongly in 
 and uh I had opportunities in high school to work in some programs um
 and and I agree with what you said that it's uh it benefits the person doing it so much I don't think they realize 
 and I uh I I think it gives you a better perspective on life 
 and uh it gives you a little bit uh more a glimpse of the the real world 
 and and it would certainly help the country too uh
 Yeah 
 Yes
 Yeah 
 Well I think sometimes through groups and organizations um 
 my first when I first thought of it I thought it uh when they asked the question I thought well that sounds wonderful 
 And then I wondered if people were unwilling 
 but but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long 
 Um but I do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um they do still have opportunities
 But I I think that's a small uh number could 
 No 
 um not since um <> not as much as I remember growing up 
 And that was something uh I think in the fifties and sixties um seemed more common in the last two decades
 But 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Where uh where abouts do you live 
 What part of the country
 Oh okay 
 We're in Plano 
 so we're not far apart 
 One of the calls I'd gotten before was uh down to Austin 
 and and I know a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest 
 so I know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area
 Oh
 Yeah
 Well 
 and maybe uh maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back Um if we've lost some of that 
 and it it seems in the last decade or two um that's true 
 maybe that's a way 
 if if young people had to do it um maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things I always thought was a wonderful part of our country Um is helping others <> 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think uh <> I think it does help um even preschoolers you know 
 they're um things even just starting around the home You know 
 little ones can do a little bit to help the family
 And and just watching the parents do things too um it can start a pattern 
 There's always something no matter how young 
 and then that helps develop that attitude 
 Um I guess I would really like to see this happen with families more 
 You know I think this is certainly a possible way um to handle it 
 but I wish 
 that's something that I think that has been lost in families 
 and I think that's a good place to start again
 Yeah 
 And I do think um the schools 
 if you're trying to do something even with food drives 
 and uh sometimes what Richardson and Plano both 
 when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is 
 that's uh 
 gosh I'm sure not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas 
 and uh it's 
 I know our church youth group uh starts with projects young 
 but they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia area every year 
 They've done this for fourteen years now
 Um and it is it's uh 
 and they've also see that there's there's a different way of life and those families are really close 
 Some of the things that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there
 and uh it really 
 every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed 
 and it's changed their perspective 
 And and that's just the t- two weeks during during the summer
 So if two weeks uh could have that kind of effect I would think uh 
 Well that's 
 Yes 
 Well I guess um 
 did you have anything else
 Okay
 Well I enjoyed talking with you
 And I hope you have a good evening
 Thanks
 Bye 
 bye
