 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Oh no 
 no 
 they're not are they
 Oh goodness 
 I would too 
 even the bench warmer I would
 Uh-huh
 Uh yeah
 Well I do to uh 
 I have boys you know like eight and eleven 
 and we go quite often to watch the Rangers
 Uh-huh 
 Oh yes 
 we're heavy into that too
 Oh I do too
 And I think uh what caught so many of our attentions last year was that Nolan Ryan you know 
 yes
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yes 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I know it 
 yeah 
 yeah
 He really is an you know 
 as far as predictions and stuff I really think the Rangers may come out real strong this year
 They coul- because 
 I don't know 
 but last year I just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything
 I really do
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 at least that should help 
 it sure should
 But in a way I really do 
 and of course there's a few more you know I think are good ball teams also
 Like Oakland A's and the Giants 
 I really do
 I like to go watch the Giants when they come to Houston some times
 But uh 
 Oh you haven't
 Oh I have a few times
 Uh they're a good ball team
 They really are
 Oh wouldn't it wouldn't it though 
 Wouldn't it
 Oh my goodness 
 we might actually get to go to a World Series huh
 Oh yeah
 That's something you dream about
 Oh there sure is 
 and uh that they really are 
 Uh now Incavalia I don't know how familiar you are with him 
 but last year I was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump
 But they're saying this year their predictions is that he's really going to come out of it and be on top
 Isn't he though
 he sure is 
 He either hits home run or strike out
 There is not ever a in between for him
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 To sign him again 
 yeah 
 Huh
 Yeah 
 oh you never know
 That's sure ri- 
 if you offer them money I'm sure they'll they'll do a little bit of everything
 No 
 no 
 no like that Joe Hosago you know
 oh 
 I hadn't heard
 I I really haven't uh
 Oh yeah
 Well I hadn't either
 We hadn't you know 
 like I said we 
 I don't even guess they've even thought about sending the schedules out yet
 Yeah 
 because we usually get one 
 We usually order our tickets way in advance
 We we try to go so often
 Oh they do
 Well I've enjoyed talking to you
 And we'll hopefully we'll get to talk again
 Okay 
 bye-bye
