 Well how much do you like lawn and garden work
 Oh
 Oh for goodness sakes
 What do you do
 Uh-huh 
 well that's interesting 
 Um so at this time of the year are you doing much garden work 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well I love to work outside really 
 and I enjoy flowers and stuff 
 I don't do a whole lot of it um at this exact point in my life um because I have two teenage boys 
 and so they do all the lawn all the lawn care 
 but I still take care of the you know flower beds and things like that
 I was even planning to go out and to uh dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here but you know were planted in the ground since last spring
 and I was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me 
 and lo and behold about five days ago we had a freeze down to about oh twenty-three degrees or something
 so the hibi- hibiscus plants no longer exist 
 And I really feel bad about it 
 it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of you know
 So they're all gone at this point 
 Gardening in Texas is really interesting though 
 I grew up in Illinois
 and um Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry 
 why you know everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has land- uh watering system
 And so with that why our lawns do stay um you know pretty nice all summer if you water
 But in the winter we have Bermuda grass
 and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack
 and and I just think it's ugly 
 When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter you know and their grass is fairly green 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Some people have I think it's fescue that stays green all winter 
 but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer
 They have to water an incredible amount 
 But um those law- those lawns look nice during the winter 
 but you know they almost stick out like a I guess not a sore thumb a pretty thumb 
 But you know when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except the one you know 
 it's sort of like well 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 that's true 
 Yeah 
 Houston is a lot um a lot wetter than than Dallas Dallas area 
 that's where Plano is 
 and um and just humidity you know just all the time it's an awfully lot more humid
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 I think people do 
 Yeah 
 I don't have a vegetable garden 
 haven't for I guess I never have here actually 
 but um but yes 
 uh-huh 
 we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio
