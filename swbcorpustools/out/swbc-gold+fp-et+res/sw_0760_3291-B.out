 All right Ron
 Total gun control
 Yes 
 I I agree something should be done 
 but I there I don't believe there is any way of total control over weapons because crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct will have access to weapons from somewhere 
 and that means they'll always have an advantage over us 
 and uh they may even get worse because they know we have nothing to support myself 
 Now you know I I agree with a lot of the things you just said in your few moments because personally I used to be a great hunter 
 and in the last few years I've said no way 
 Matter of fact if I find a uh a a fly running around in the house I pick him up and carry him outdoors 
 I I don't even hit him with a flyswatter 
 so I've uh gotten over this business of wanting to go out and shooting and and killing and that sort of thing
 But I I think that uh personally that we do need some weapons available to most of the people 
 Most of the people really are uh honest and uh worthy of carrying on their lives properly 
 Uh I'm sort of in line thinking in terms 
 I don't see anything wrong with this five day waiting period if the waiting period is utilized to really look at the background of the person purchasing the weapon 
 there's nothing wrong with that 
 Do you see anything wrong with that
 Right
 Yeah
 I'm again- I'm against this uh automatic and semiautomatic stuff 
 I don't think we should have access to those
 No
 Huh <>
 Yes
 And the the people should be uh selected so that we know that they are all right and that they're they're not uh acquiring weapons for illicit use 
 Uh that is not good 
 There's nothing wrong with a person that enjoys the mechanisms 
 As a matter of fact uh there's a fellow out there working on my house right now who uh brought to me a target from a rifle that he uh pretty well halfway designed 
 and he he put together the uh the bullets in it
 and he was showing me that at a hundred yards he kept five shots within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards 
 Now see from a technical point of view that is something that that our military people need to know about
 So there are other interesting uh facets in in guns and weapons
 This is a uh bolt action rifle I think he has 
 And he has done other things to the way the uh barrel sits in the uh the wood part of it 
 And uh he designed the the the bullets themselves 
 and he has fantastic accuracy
 Just just from a technical point of view that interests me Not to kill anybody with it or anything with it but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
