 Okay 
 CHINA CRY was basically the the true story written by this this lady who had uh was a native a native Chinese uh uh who was raised by Christian parents
 And her her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution
 Although she herself had never really accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other uh Christian uh portions of of the faith repentance baptisms et cetera et cetera She had always felt a very strong uh leaning in this direction 
 And whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred and most churches were either banned or their all the clergy and so forth were killed or or imprisoned or and the property confiscated she was safe because she had you know not officially joined the the Christian movement
 So anyway she as she grew up towards maturity her parents well 
 her dad was a doctor 
 and and he was rather well you know rather well to do in the old regime 
 and the the Chin- the commu- the communist Chinese didn't like this at all 
 You know the bourgeoisie was was was definitely out of uh style then
 Everybody was back to a commonality of one 
 And so they kept picking at him picking at his at her mother and uh finally uh started picking on her And getting her to you know 
 they were starting to uh accuse her of of of uh crimes and atrocities before the the revolution and and had her write her own story over and over and over 
 Uh and the uh the major point of the movie was that that she had uh married this this Chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court 
 Now I think I'm leaving out a portion 
 She gr- she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had uh gotten a job as as an instructor 
 and they had her teaching were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers When the they decided that that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre uh regime crimes as it were
 Being a child you know 
 So they kept on and on at at her
 and in the meantime she and her husband uh were ex- ex- were expecting a child their own child 
 And uh the the people kept harassing her over you know over a period of months 
 and finally they uh carried her uh out into the courtyard to to either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of of shooting her uh with by firing you know executing her by firing squad
 And uh the Lord just said no 
 this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really you know 
 she's she's one of mine 
 she is not going to die 
 and uh the the soldiers were blinded when they shot
 And she her life was spared 
 And this this frightened the the uh the commandant 
 and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp
 Well uh and course here's this this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around
 Well she she put in for going going to uh 
 and her husband had escaped to Hong Kong uh 
 and then she put in to go see him 
 And over time she uh uh 
 finally through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the the middle uh bureauc- bureaucracy that they finally let her go
 And of course she had to walk 
 You know they they stripped her of everything practically besides the the clothes on her back 
 And uh so she so she went across the border to her husband and another and other child that they'd already had uh to freedom
 And they knew that she wasn't going to come back 
 but yeah she did years later when the uh liberalization you know in real life liberalization of China happened 
 and uh she was not persecuted or anything else like that
 Yes 
 it was 
 Uh very moving too
 Well it was within oh ninety days
 Yeah 
 No 
 it's it was it was advertised over a period of about ninety days
 But it wasn't 
 uh they didn't have it in uh too awfully many movie houses 
 but it was it was in the 
 it had large uh uh uh press release
