 I thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and uh how many people are self serving 
 [you I + I ] think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt And that people aren't self serving 
 that's what I would like to think 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 Right <>
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that makes sense
 Because you start prying in people's private lives you ruin their lives as well as 
 And sometimes you know I don't even know how much of a difference it really makes you know
 I guess in some cases sure we care about what they did in the past 
 but uh sometimes I don't know 
 I think it gets in the way of the better judgment 
 just because you did something in the past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 That's it 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Um <>
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Oh yeah 
 I guess it's what sells newspapers you know
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh <>
 Right 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I am kind of the same way 
 I just kind of read the paper follow up on peop- you know just keep an eye on what's going on 
 but I don't really play an active role in any kind of politics 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
