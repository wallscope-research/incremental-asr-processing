 Okay
 We have a uh four bedroom split brick home in in Richardson actually
 And uh we bought it back in about nineteen seventy-three 
 So we've seen it go up in value wise real well 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 yes 
 It it looks like all the others 
 It's uh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh I know where that is Yeah *[[should this be two slash units]]/
 Yes 
 you're in the the styles that they have started building in the last couple years with the real high ceilings
 and uh-huh 
 Thou- those are lovely
 Oh 
 Oh nice
 Yes
 Have you um found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are quite a bit higher with those high ceilings
 Are they
 Uh-huh 
 Well I would expect so 
 I have wondered about the cooling and the heating Especially the cooling
 Wow 
 Uh-huh
 Well how many bedrooms do you have in your home
 Oh uh-huh
 Oh how nice Huh *[[should this be two slash units]]/
 Uh-huh
 That's a pretty good size room
 That's neat
 Well it sounds like a real nice one
 Right 
 Where did you move from
 Oh uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Do you like the Dallas area
 And I would imagine that you have found that the homes down here are uh a much better value down here aren't they than they are 
 Oh really
 Now that's interesting
 Uh-huh
 That's interesting because I've heard so many people down here say that they don't feel like the quality of the homes you know are that good down here
 And uh so that's interesting
 Well that's good
 Well I know as I as I said our house is about seventeen years old 
 and uh we've been very pleased with it 
 We've had no major problems with it 
 Knock on wood 
 And uh you know it is with uh with the you know two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it all the time 
 So and we like our neighborhood 
 It it has has grown 
 and the majority of the people you know keep up the neighborhood
 And that's very important 
 and and as I said it it has ris- risen in value
 But we bought back when housing was so low
 and you know and now i- you know i- 
 then it started jumping by leaps and bounds
 It seems to have leveled off and actually dropped back down a little bit
 but we're still fine
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yes 
 It should bring up your property values a little bit
 Your pricing
 Uh-huh
 I think once the economic situation in the Dallas area improves I think the housing will go up
 You know Right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs and everything 
 so that's you know that keeps prices down and value down 
 and I'm sure the packs uh or 
 would like for it to go up
 That's right 
 That's right
