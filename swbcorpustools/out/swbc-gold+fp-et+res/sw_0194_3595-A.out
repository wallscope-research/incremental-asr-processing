 Arlington Texas 
 now since I got somebody from Arlington Virginia one day 
 Yeah
 Oh
 Birmingham
 Right 
 It's funny how many names have been used uh all over the country
 Well to tell you the truth I've been going to college for the last four years 
 so mainly text books 
 No um 
 but I I really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones
 but you know sometimes biogr- 
 I just read one about Grace Kelley 
 I love to read about real people 
 To me half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories 
 Yeah 
 it happened
 Really
 Right
 I used to like to read about royalty a lot 
 I when I was younger I read about every king and queen that lived I think in Europe 
 That was my thing for a while
 Oh really
 Oh it sounds like fun
 Wonder if it was by one of those famous writers you know 
 Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those
 Really
 Sounds like something she would write
 Yeah 
 I've heard that she's done real- you know her books are really interesting 
 and they always sell well
 And uh 
 Yeah 
 brings it to life
 I know uh the Bri- some of the British people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty
 I know 
 our movie stars
 Oh right
 Um
 Oh yes
 Oh I always like those
 Have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch
 Isn't she fabulous
 Oh once you st- 
 I don't like to get one of her books 
 because I I just live to read 
 I'll I'll skip everything just to get back to the book 
 Oh yeah
 She's just a 
 I don't know 
 does she how often does she come out with them 
 I probably have missed the last few since I've been back in school
 Well she can she can turn them out overnight I swear
 Yeah 
 I've never read a whole one of hers I don't think
 And think how rich she is
 Oh yeah
 And then make movies out of some of them
 Well hers are so involved 
 and they're so such a higher intellectual level because she quotes a lot you know
 I do too 
 so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers 
 but oh her books are just incredible 
 I don't think they've ever made a movie do you
 Yes
 well no uh 
 I really just thought about it now 
 but there's just 
 Maybe it's because they take so much in 
 I don't know
 They're so big
 they're such you know 
 it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND I guess another three hour movie 
 Oh I know 
 It's about one of my favorite movies
 No 
 it had such a bad press 
 I wasn't too 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Me either 
 Do you know anyone that's read it
 No 
 I haven't heard of anybody that's read it either
 I think it was on the best-seller list though for a while
