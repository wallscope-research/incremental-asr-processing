 Do you have any pets now
 Joey 
 th- the dog is Joey
 The cat is 
 Oh my goodness
 Oh my 
 I beg your pardon
 Oh
 Well did you all catch it 
 or uh 
 Uh-huh
 No 
 did 
 no 
 did you catch the fish
 Uh-huh 
 and it's all alone in that aquarium
 Well at the present time I have two dogs
 An English setter you know 
 that's the white dog with the feathers 
 and it has uh yellow spots on it which they call I think uh liver spots
 And that's a male 
 And I have a wonderful female lab black lab
 Quite a long time uh probably five or six years 
 and unfortunately the black lab that's a female it tha- it's it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had 
 an i- 
 when she was about three years old we noticed that she was having pro- uh problems limping and so forth 
 and she has hip dysplasia
 And it's in that breed
 But now I think there are tests that can be conducted uh to tell whether or not the puppies have the have it 
 But I think 
 I don't know 
 apparently they've been so in well I don't know inbred or what 
 but 
 Well n- 
 I'm not sure that's the situation 
 but it um 
 for those dogs that are registered 
 and if if you should have one uh that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it uh
 Uh-huh 
 but she's wonderful
 Um like ha- 
 what are the what are the symptoms
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Um Well uh I have had just wonderful luck with this lab uh 
 when i- 
 uh let's see winter before last we would bring her in and uh when it was cold
 And she wouldn't 
 I you know 
 the next morning you want to take them out 
 and she wouldn't 
 I couldn't get her up without p- picking her up and which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds
 Um until 
 if I allowed her to not get up on her own it'd be two o'clock in the afternoon
 Anyway I uh met my son's uh college roommate is a vet 
 and he said um let's give her some race horse shots 
 And you know in 
 I'm I'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this but you because you all the time you know run into people with problems
 Anyway that's when we lived in Oklahoma 
 and uh so he gave this dog a series of 
 it's 
 they give it to race horses uh to get rid of uh cartilage
 and it's called 
 Anyway it's a series of six shots once a week 
 and then I noticed after two shots she was 
 Well I could have 
 but I can't give a shot
 I took her from Enid Oklahoma to Oklahoma City every week for six weeks
 And uh after the the second shot she was significantly better 
 Then I didn't notice any improvement till the after the sixth one
 And ever since 
 and he said uh a booster uh every year or two maybe every six months or or something like that 
 and when I notice in the winter when it's worse you know it's cold weather and so forth then I have uh gotten a booster for her 
 But not many people in this part of the country know anything about 
 I've had to get it from Oklahoma 
 They've heard about it 
 but they've really never used it
 So dogs that get down in the hips 
 like I think German Shepherds do it and probably large dogs
 And uh it's just wonderful
 Uh
 Um um well we're living now in an area where we we we're in the woods 
 and we take walks 
 I just don't let them uh uh go away from me 
 but we take walks through the woods twice a day
 And uh I can over do it on her
 But anyway at least she can go 
 and she's not limping along and all that
 Tell me about your cat
 And is um Stripper an inside cat or outside
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Well of course
 That's nice 
 they they 
 Well he just can 
 well he has been trained 
 and you've ke- you've kept u- it up haven't you
 Yeah 
 it is wonderful 
 I I have some neighbors across the field 
 and um they 
 when we first moved here uh when the dogs and I didn't fe- 
 we have a very nice kennel and everything 
 but but since I I didn't want to 
 I wa- I just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while
 So I kept watch and never let them get away 
 but now every couple weeks they wou- one would slip away 
 and my neighbor said to me oh I noticed those dogs dogs are so well trained 
 anytime they hear your voice they come 
 So that made me very proud 
 Well have we been talking five minutes
 I'm not either 
 but 
 Yeah 
 Well um so it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure
 Yes
 Oh really 
 uh-huh
 No 
 they don't 
 no 
 I I glanced at the clock when um we started 
 and I think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something 
 But one day I was talking to a lady about gardening 
 and I'm I love gardening 
 and she did too 
 an and after after about twelve minutes or something the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape 
 Uh-huh 
 but it's been so much fun too uh talk
 Well my best friend in Virginia's daughter is a part of this project in Texas
 And so she knew that I had the time and would be would enjoy it
 Um so 
 But I have a hard time getting anybody because I guess 
 do you work
 Yeah 
 and probably just got home
 So um during the day I me- 
 I thi- 
 and I understand also they want men
 Yeah 
 my husband does
 Yes
 Yes 
 wh- I think so too 
 and I haven't helped them out on the me- on men particularly 
 but my husband had been ma- in fact he's been probably has made a few more calls than I have because I tend to not make them around dinner time
 I try to you know make them do during the day 
 but nobody's home
 Well good 
 Yeah 
 it so fo- much fun to talk to you
 You too 
 bye
