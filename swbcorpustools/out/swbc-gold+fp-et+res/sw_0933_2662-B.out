 I haven't seen that yet 
 I I I hear 
 we a whole bunch of us were going to go see it 
 It's playing at school actually in about two weeks I guess 
 So we're going to go see that 
 But you enjoyed that
 That's what I heard 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I've heard it it it's not one for the videos
 Really
 Um let's see 
 Well uh this is almost sort of funny 
 I was just sit- um 
 friend and I went to see OUT FOR JUSTICE which is Steven Segal because uh we're both big karate fans
 So we wanted to see what this is like 
 And uh impressed with actually
 Yeah 
 I wasn't I've seen his other movies 
 and I just think he's pretty good
 But uh this movie 
 I'm convinced now he can act
 Oh his his his karate is pretty good 
 I think in this one it wasn't so good 
 I generally um 
 movies like that scare me though 
 I'd be just fine without them because you know kids come running out wanting to beat each other up
 Fighting
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well that that was number one for the week actually too 
 so so it was a little bit uh 
 I was thinking Wow 
 people must be into crime movies again 
 But but in the middle of that conversation we sort or picked an um an interesting point 
 Last year's number one movie for the year was GHOSTS
 I don't know if you saw GHOSTS or not
 Yeah 
 and and and that was that that helped us sort of feel good about you know about ourselves and about one around us in that at least at least if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that at least they're still going to see the real good movies you know
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It was it I was absolutely enthralled by it
 Oh Patrick Swayze
 Yeah 
 he's very good
 Really 
 I'm trying to think what else I've seen recently 
 What else have we seen recently 
 Oh you know what's pretty cute actually Um 
 DEFENDING YOUR LIFE
 Have you heard of it
 Yeah um 
 I actually hadn't heard anything about it 
 and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie 
 and and they said it starred um Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks 
 at first they told me
 And I thought what a strange combination 
 Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep
 Well actually it starred that that it's actually Albert Brooks 
 so it's lot better 
 Mel Brooks you probably know
 I know 
 so it it was a strange combination 
 But it turned out to be a very cute movie 
 the whole premise is that they go out 
 and and they die
 and they have to 
 Right 
 Both of them are dead 
 and they happen to meet in this this town um this this sort of city where you're set up 
 You know they <> go 
 and they decide if you can move up to the next level
 I don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull 
 but it's something like that 
 They sort of move up to levels 
 and and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough 
 and as it turns out you know they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that
 So you can guess the rest of the plot 
 It actually it's it's really funny because they run through you know what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives
 And that's pretty good actually
 Yeah 
 And it's 
 you actually have to go up there 
 and you have a they have an attorney for you know attorney for you and attorney 
 a defense and a prosecution 
 and you know the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level 
 and the defense's job is to make sure that you you do you know 
 It's uh it's a neat little story actually
 I was I was I went thinking it'll be okay not great <> 
 and then I actually came away thinking it was really pretty good 
 So 
 Yeah
 Um
 The other world 
 yeah
 Um I'm I'm sure that it seems like 
 it certainly would would explain the preoccupation with 
 but I suspect it's always been a preoccupation with that sort of things
 Right 
 well 
 Well did you ever see um FLATLINERS
 That's that's that's probably one of those ones that you know 
 it's on video now I think
 Probably probably worth seeing on video 
 Actually we really enjoyed it 
 but it was also right along the same lines 
 they they would go ahead and kill themselves for three or four minutes to see what happens
 Almost 
 yeah 
 I I it's a little far fetched to find a bunch of medical students doing it 
 but but it was um it was it was odd enough you know 
 and they didn't just sort of make it silly 
 It was you know it was done fairly well I think 
 So Actually I actually enjoyed that as well
 The story sort of keeps going and going
 Yeah 
 great 
 Well it was n- nice talking to you
 Bye-bye
