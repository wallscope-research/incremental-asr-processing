 What kind of movies have you been seeing lately
 Oh it's an excellent movie
 SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
 What was that anyway 
 Okay
 Uh-huh 
 Let's see 
 who was in FISHER KING 
 That was um Robin Williams 
 and uh and uh I can't the last name
 Uh we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately 
 Um we really enjoyed um DEAD POETS' SOCIETY
 Um several years back one we saw we saw we really really enjoyed was uh ORDINARY PEOPLE with uh Timothy Hutton and uh Mary Tyler Moore 
 and uh uh who played the father anyway
 excellent movie
 Yes 
 we have
 Oh we loved it
 I know what you mean 
 I know what you mean
 Yeah 
 I'm pretty impressed with stuff he's done 
 Uh he made kind of an odd sounding ROBIN HOOD 
 but uh you know basic thick western U S accent for a ROBIN HOOD just doesn't seem to fit
 Oh no 
 It's a good movie
 Well um they did a real good job with it
 Um they didn't try to make him super human or you know invincible 
 They just just 
 he worked hard at it 
 No 
 I haven't not an opportunity to see that uh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It sounds kind of like one uh we saw at home here on the rented it um CLARA'S HEART
 Um Whoopi Goldberg
 And she played a uh 
 the uh 
 she's a housekeeper
 Yeah 
 she's a housekeeper 
 she She was a oh now I can't say it a Haitian 
 Anyway she uh she seemed to be that sort of person that seems half crazy 
 but then again she's got a whole lot on the ball 
 and the movie had the whole lot of philosophical content more than more than you know 
 it wasn't a mystery 
 it wasn't you know blood and guts and violence and and car chases type thing 
 It was just a good movie
 A KISS BEFORE DYING
 And 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable that's still worth watching
 Oh okay
