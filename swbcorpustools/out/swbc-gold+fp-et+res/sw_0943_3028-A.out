 Are you ready
 She didn't announce that to you
 Oh I see 
 That's fine 
 Um I think uh that's pleasurable for all of us if we choose the right restaurant 
 So what are your thoughts on dining out
 Not for the price
 Okay

 Really

 What about fast foods 
 Do you have a preference if you were going to eat a fast food
 You do like Arby's
 See I don't like Arby's
 No 
 because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever 
 They use the they use the insides of the animals heart and liver 
 and they they form it 
 and they make it look like roast beef 
 and I said no 
 thank you
 Well that's not what I heard from one of somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Unless somebody is trying to blackball them
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 How about the health food uh restaurants Well like this one 
 but it's probably not advertised as such is it 
 Or 
 Uh-huh 
 Health food uh restaurants that 
 [ Well well like um well ] I can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between 
 But they ought there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious You know as far as their cholesterol levels and their their fat content and you know the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product 
 and they list them 
 Now there's one restaurant that does that 
 and it's called Rodolfo's 
 over on Preston Road and Royal Lane I believe
 And they r- have very good food over there
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 They do list um you know list the fat
 Uh-huh

 Uh-huh 
 Well I guess if you were having if you were trying to impress somebody w- like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant It's a special occasion type thing 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 And now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime
 Because they're 
 Well they have lunch specials that

 and it was excellent 
 It was a marinated broiled chicken breast 
 and it was exce- 
 Oh it was
 Well I've never had catfish either in a restaurant because I'm from the north
 and that was a no no
 And I haven't gotten over that from the north
 I know they say that that is 
 but I'm but they've got all these caution signs now on fish
 and so I kind of stay a- 
 Because of all the pollution in the lakes and the everywhere there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish
 I- and especially uh in Wisconsin and Michigan they say no buying of our fish
 I 
 Well yeah 
 So yo- I am 
 and the the best brand of chicken to buy is the uh Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote uh unnatural growth in their products
 So we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy
 So I'm I you know I 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Corrode
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good
 Oh dear
 Wow
 Sure
 Yeah
 That's right 
 Everything we eat
 Everything everything we eat should have a label on it 
 Yeah 
 Well you know 
 Well Becky you know even if you lived off your own land that you would have to put caution signs
