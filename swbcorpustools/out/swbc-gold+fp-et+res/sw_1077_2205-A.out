 Well I really enjoy reading the newspaper 
 we get the daily uh DALLAS MORNING NEWS 
 and I try to look at it 
 If I get busy I don't get a chance to pick it up like this week I noticed several copies have been un- haven't been touched 
 but 
 Well not in the morning 
 but uh if the 
 well I have two children 
 and if they uh go out to play or something I like to keep my eye on them so I'll you know maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something
 Uh-huh
 Well we I don't take like TIME or NEWSWEEK or anything like that 
 but I do like to watch uh C N N 
 I have several chores and things to do 
 so it comes on at like the nine o'clock p m 
 and so I will turn that on while I'm doing some work 
 and I can hear the news not have to sit right down and listen to it
 Well he didn't have too good of opinion of it 
 no 
 yes I did hear that 
 and so uh I do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh
 Well I wouldn't think th- I would really say that that's not true because uh it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates
 and so uh news stations always tell the story from a certain angle 
 and that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions 
 You may never get the truth 
 but you'll have a variety to choose from
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I do too 
 Do you ever listen to the radio 
 or any 
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I don't
 Um I really uh have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of even music 
 and uh 
 Yeah 
 my husband does 
 and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes and says oh I just heard on the news that such and such happened you know if it's something really interesting 
 and and then I'll know to to keep an eye out for it 
 but I've got out of the habit of listening to the radio
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Do you have a particular local channel that you watch
 Uh-huh
 Um Well I am we're fairly new to the area 
 and so we're still shopping for a favorite channel
 Uh-huh
 Well I really think so 
 I noticed on channel eight that there's all of the uh anchors are seem to be like white Anglo Saxon protestant type people 
 and they all seem to be you know fairly similar 
 and I kind of prefer a you know some females 
 I don't recall that they have any female anchors 
 and I like different I like the anchors to be different kinds of people
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I have 
 and uh I prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because I think you're you're more likely to get 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Well we you know 
 like all of the stations seem to be pretty good 
 it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into
 Houston 
 So we had a a favorite 
 or I did have a favorite channel that I usually tuned into for local news 
 I guess because you get use to you like the anchors
 and you feel comfortable with them 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's true
 Their job
 That's true 
 So that really effects how they report the news
 Is he the sports 
 Yeah 
 I guess it is time to close now so I can run go help put the kids to bed
 Yeah
 Bye-bye
