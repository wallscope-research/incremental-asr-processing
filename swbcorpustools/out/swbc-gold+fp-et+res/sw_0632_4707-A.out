 I went I turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon
 Are you eating
 No it's 
 Say what
 Tell you what we can do is uh I can punch the uh one
 and then w- after five minutes when the uh uh voice comes on we can talk all night if we want 
 Uh I love the irony of uh talking about this subject on April the fifteenth 
 But uh I'm afraid I'm I'm probably in the minority 
 I I actually don't think that we uh pay too much in this country Uh uh particularly uh in this part of the country w- 
 uh I guess I do have a a bone to pick with uh uh the way taxes are distributed 
 Uh I just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form 
 and the sales tax can't 
 I think that's regressive 
 and uh uh it's kind of dumb
 Well nobody taxes groceries 
 Where
 Is that right
 Right
 Right 
 But I guess when I hear when I see the comparison between the United States and uh any other western country uh their their rates are like uh forty-one forty-two and ours are like thirty-six thirty-seven you know 
 if you compute as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well 
 T- th- there's no other country that's that is taxed as low as we are
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 I'm I'm not sure I understand what you mean
 Right
 Oh you mean lowest end of living in spite of lower higher taxes 
 Yeah 
 I suppose that's true 
 yeah 
 Uh probably m- less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever 
 but 
 Yeah
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 since uh I send my kids to parochial school that 
 It's not it's not quite the bargain that 
 But I pay them gladly 
 That's a decision 
 I think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools f- with the same tax money 
 But uh that's that's the way Americans want to interpret it 
 I guess that's all right 
 But 
 yeah 
 I 
 and if I were uh 
 when I was single and again when I'm retired I will not mind paying uh what it takes to keep the schools good 
 That's always been a high priority 
 I do 
 yeah 
 that's true 
 I think in places I think in places like California people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off if you add the uh uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are uh just looking for fun th- people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens
 And uh there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done 
 That seems a a like a cultural lapse 
 people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools 
 They 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 People would rather uh increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them 
 But I think it's sad selfish and shortsighted 
 Yeah
 Well
