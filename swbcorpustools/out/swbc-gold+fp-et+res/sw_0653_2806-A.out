 All right uh 
 you have pets I understand a couple of them
 What are they
 Pets get like that don't they 
 they think they own you 
 Okay 
 these are cats 
 I remember one time uh I used to get a chuckle out of out of Pogo 
 That dates me quite a bit 
 you probably don't know po- 
 Yeah 
 he i- 
 when Beauregard was talking he was the dog remember
 and he used to say pets can be most as much trouble as ki- as kids if they work at it a little bit and even more when they work at it a little bit 
 And I think that's true 
 act- 
 Oh uh-huh
 Th- co- just good company huh that's neat
 it's funny how pets get to be so uh 
 they really yo- you really do mourn them after when things happen 
 Now we don't actually have a pet right now
 But uh but we have had some 
 and and I ca- I 
 it's always hard for me to believe how close I've gotten to them 
 We had a little uh uh oh dog 
 it was a little uh 
 I got it so it wouldn't wouldn't shed one of these French Poodle a little French Poodle
 Yeah 
 and uh he used to I used to come down stairs in the morning to feed him you know 
 and I'd let him up out of the basement where he was sleeping 
 and he would just dance around the floor 
 and I just got 
 and we only had him about three or four weeks before he was hit by a car
 but I cannot believe the whole family just he just got in t- to us so quickly 
 I could not believe it
 I I have to tell you about our most interesting pet though
 Uh we had an iguana living with us for about uh about two years two and a half years I guess 
 It was about uh oh three feet long about three feet long 
 It was a beautiful animal 
 name was Clyde
 Clyde the iguana 
 And uh my son Dan went to uh to uh Hawaii for the summer 
 and when he came home uh he didn't bring the iguana with him 
 but for some reason or other he had a thing for them 
 I don't know whether he'd 
 I think there was one in the school uh zoology department you know or biology department one or the other anyway uh 
 and anyway he just he went and found this guy in in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one in I guess in Te- in Mexico 
 I don't know where 
 But anyway he brought this home 
 and I looked at him 
 and I said you've got to be kidding I'm not going to live with a lizard 
 But you know I visualize that animal racing about 
 and you know like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that 
 They're very much like uh 
 well the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there 
 and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes
 No
 he had full run of the house
 He just loved to sit on the back of my dryer where the h- air the heat came up out of the dryer you know
 It was he was really a neat pet 
 and though I you know 
 he'd ri- 
 when we'd have family home evening and everybody would sit in the living room and the fire would be burning he'd walk across my feet sometimes 
 And it it was a long time before I could really pet him 
 and but I fed him 
 and he he knew how to get me to feed him 
 He'd come out to the kitchen just kind of look at me until I went and got him something out of the refrigerator
 But he was really a neat animal 
 He he'd lay in Dan's lap you know 
 and just uh when he'd pet him he'd just stretch 
 and you know you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does
 It was kind of interesting 
 But he did a lot of interesting things 
 and uh Dan carried him around 
 and he liked to ride on the back of his up on his head you know with his tail wrapped around his arm so he wouldn't fall off an and scare everybody to death 
 and kids loved him 
 kids just loved him 
 Kids just came from all over to come and see Clyde and visit with him 
 and and he tolerated them you know 
 He'd even tolerate him petting though 
 he didn't like them too well at first 
 but he he got tame you know 
 so that uh people could go in there 
 And Dan was a drummer
 and he didn't he the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming
 When Dan would drum he'd sit there and scrunch up you know 
 like he was trying to hi- protect himself <> 
 and then he'd leave the room 
 Oh yeah 
 they really are they're interesting 
 well they take on human characteristics like uh our other animal 
 the next year our our son Ken went to Hawaii 
 and well while Dan was in Hawaii Ken decided he wanted a dog 
 and he and he looked around a long while 
 and he found a Norwegian elkhound 
 and he just brought this Norwegian elkhound an home 
 and he was so funny 
 Uh for a while they built a a run for him out to the side of the house you know 
 He'd been on the patio 
 but they put the run out there 
 and he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by 
 and sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him 
 And one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him 
 and and Hal + and I were in bed 
 and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house 
 and and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air And then bark and march around you know 
 and then he'd pick up his dish again and throw it in the air until we came out and gave him some water
 Did what
 No 
 he didn't eat flies
 No 
 they eat uh they eat greens
 Uh we fed him the outside leaves of lettuce you know 
 I'd get lettuce at the store 
 and he'd eat the outside leaves
 And then in the summertime you could put him out 
 and he'd eat outside o- except you had to keep him away from the garden because he liked to eat the little peas as fast as they came up you know
 It was really it was s really a of things that were fresh sprigs you know 
 he liked that
 Well yeah 
 when uh when Dan went up to college up at Ricksun Idaho he took him with him
 and uh everybody was used to him 
 and they just loved him and what not 
 and this f- his roommate put him out one day 
 and Dan didn't know it 
 and it got dark 
 and he didn't get him in again 
 And they searched and searched and searched for him 
 but uh uh it got too cold up there 
 and he he died in a tree 
 Tha- they found him the next day in a tree 
 but 
 So you ca- you have to be pretty tender with them 
 we had a he had his own heat lamp and uh and uh hot pad he laid on you know 
 That was another funny thing 
 he had a hot pad 
 and it it burned up one time 
 and boy it was that was funny too watching him kind of burned up 
 but anyway 
 An we got him a new one 
 he had a blue one before 
 and when we got him a new one it was brown 
 and he wouldn't lay on it until we changed the covers
 No 
 he wouldn't lay on it
 Bu- so they really are they really pick up things 
 He was he was a clean animal uh 
 we h- he went to the bathroom in the bathroom
 Pu- well we put some papers on the floor underneath the john 
 and he went there to go to the bathroom 
 You had to be sure you left the doors open you know 
 he didn't like to go anywhere else
 he'd he'd scratch and do all kinds of things to get you to open the door if you happened to close it on him or something you know 
 but but even when he went when he had an accident or something uh 
 if you just let it dry it dries kind of like uh 
 especially when he was inside and just eating lettuce it dried up a little bit like ashes 
 and you could just vacuum it up
 In the winter time there was no smell at all no odor at all to it 
 And in the summertime when he was outside and eating outside the smell was a little bit like a cat you know
 But uh 
 Yeah 
 he is he was a really interesting animal
 I I just uh we just really 
 and you know to this day I still miss him 
 and that's been years ago
 Yeah 
 he was just 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I think I guess so 
 But i- it's it was interesting
 Well what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you pet them 
 Yeah
 Oh and you just kind of took them over huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 A little bit easier to have cats in this kind of country though isn't it 
 uh We- I think 
 Yeah 
 that could be could be 
 Oh pretty ones
 Newhart 
 Yeah 
 ye-
