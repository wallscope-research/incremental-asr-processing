 Ok
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I understand that 
 I have been trying to get myself motivated 
 I had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor Uh 
 she had injured her back and needed a walking partner 
 and I thought that would be the time to get going
 And so we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks 
 and uh then she had to get back to work and which was traveling to New York 
 and so she is not around
 And I just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning
 I don't seem to find time in the day time
 And of course it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Well more than weight 
 of course I could lose uh lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds 
 but I think more than that 
 I also notice I just feel better when I exercise
 And that is something that I am motivated about now because I do need to get myself feeling better just in better shape 
 But uh all the same it is connected to my attitude 
 because I am not feeling as perky and good 
 I am also 
 it is hard to get my attitude to uh to get myself up there
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 And you have less chance of hurting yourself
 Yeah
 Last time I tried running with my daughter cause she is supposed to be jogging in P E 
 and it felt good 
 but then I had pulled a muscle in my knee 
 Actually I hyper extended it or something 
 and uh boy 
 I was suffering for about three weeks later
 So and I have never had that problem before
 but I guess that age just starts to catch up to me 
 It is showing up in the weirdest places
 Oh is it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well I have got a dog now 
 and of course she needs walking
 and that is a little less trau- uh burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her
 And I can put on the earphones to have something to listen to 
 and 
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 That is kind of an idea 
 We we have uh over here in Plano a little recreation center that has got uh a walking track 
 that it is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it any time of the year
 But I find it very tedious because I am watching the clock constantly 
 and it there is just nothing else to look at 
 and I actually get more tired doing that than 
 I could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good 
 There I could barely make a couple of miles
