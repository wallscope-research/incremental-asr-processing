 Uh-huh
 Uh that's pro- I probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way I think
 Uh I definitely think that there some things shouldn't be limited like like you said rifles and uh hunting rifles and possible handguns for people who use them to 
 Right 
 And but I think the I think semiautomatic weapons people say they use them because it for sport 
 But I I personally cannot see any use for them other than uh for for like people who dislike have some sort of crazed you know ambition to use have high powered weapons or something
 Right 
 And you can only how much do you wa- 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Well I think par- uh in that ca- I think that cases like that it's definitely um I think if you're to say okay 
 we have to get rid of them all because you know they can only they only seem to do bad it it's uh it's saying we're t- 
 Right 
 right 
 And people who people who have them and are responsible with them are are are being punished 
 and people who and they're saying that people you cannot take care of things yourself or like that you're not smart enough to teach your kids how to how to uh 
 Right

 Well I think we I grew up in a family 
 and and my father had two guns
 because he used to hunt years ago 
 but he stopped before really before I was old enough to remember
 But and I knew we had the guns in the house 
 and th- the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time 
 but we it was never my brothers sisters nor I never none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun 
 or let's go get the gun 
 it was just something you knew was there
 and th- it was your father's 
 and y- you that was not something you'd go and play played with at all
 and I think maybe uh and that's the type of the thing that should be you know stressed
