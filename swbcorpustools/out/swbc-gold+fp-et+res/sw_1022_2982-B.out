 Uh well I work with computers just like your son
 and I actually do research in speech recognition
 part of the reason I'm participating in the project is to see how the stuff goes
 But um I was working 
 well actually I haven't worked for any large companies per se uh recently 
 but hopefully the job that I will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations
 Yeah 
 the uh 
 well actually where I was working the company 
 one of the companies I was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days I think are really important
 because health care is so ridiculously expensive
 Because we're we're paying our own insurance right now
 But and I'm 
 we actually had a little baby so I'm taking a little bit of a time off from work
 Oh congratulations 
 And so one thing that I'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits 
 because it's more important with a family
 and you know our doctor's vi- routine doctor's visits covered 
 my health insurance only covers um the emergency care
 Right yeah 
 but I don't 
 Right
 Well my 
 our deductible's five hundred 
 but it's for each event
 Right 
 but you know so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick
 it doesn't cover doctor's visits things like that
 Oh yeah 
 it certainly is
 Uh
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 And probably the medical care is less expensive too
 Uh-huh
 So I think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there 
 and so the insurance would cost lower
 Well I know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston
 and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan
 And they were at one of the better hospitals you know
 and you know good doctors in Boston
 And I was at one of the big hospitals in New York
 But that's a huge difference just between
 you know and it's two big cities that I think of as somewhat comparable
 So I was pretty shocked at that 
 But the other thing that I'm really concerned about 
 and most companies don't have 
 some are starting to have is day care
 because it would be really nice to be able to have you know someone that could watch my daughter at work 
 And I'd go to work 
 and if she were sick I could go down and see her if she needs to be fed whatever
 And I 
 It would be more convenient more productive I think
 Uh-huh
 And and your hours are much more constrained and things like that
 And that to me well that you know 
 those three things the health care vacation and day care are probably the most important benefits
 I suppose I should be concerned with life insurance and uh retirement plans 
 but 
 Yeah
 Right 
 because you're you know 
 certainly something like day care at the work place would make life so much simpler that it's worth paying you know having a lower salary 
 I would certainly accept a lower salary for that You know everything else being equal 
 because your life would be so much easier
 And there's a question of quality of life also
 Yeah
 Right 
 and you you you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she something happened And you're less preoccupied with it I think
 But unfortunately there aren't 
 I think I B M has started having that in certain locations
 Uh-huh 
 Is that locally
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 because Pittsburgh's a big enough city too
 But you know I wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones Just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and things like that 
 Because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies
 Like uh one company had proposed to me that I could come back to work after having the baby um any where between ten and forty hours a week And um call my own days call my own hours
 Yeah
 and which 
 many times at a large company it's almost impossible to do things like that
 Right
 And if you get two weeks off you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day
 So it all depends on what your position is there too
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Was that when you were um well 
 those have its pluses and minuses too 
 I've been a consultant recently and so I don't have any benefits at all 
 and 
 Right 
 and the same thing 
 my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant
 and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is 
 and um they they they 
 Right 
 and they they refuse to give him more salary 
 Because they say they can't pay more than this and that and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that
 and you know times are rough now 
 so it's new 
 it's harder to get the uh you know increases and things
 but um 
 Yeah 
 well he's 
 Right 
 well he's been doing a long term 
 he's being called a consultant 
 and he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place
 And they they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits 
 he doesn't get well 
 we don't care about retirement benefits 
 He doesn't get um vacation benefits 
 and he does a lot of things that get factored into somebody else's salary
 So really his salary should be you know twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that not including the fact that you know it's a less long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff
