 Well a lot of women are knowl- as knowledge about football as I am
 Can I guess your favorite team if you had one might be the Steelers
 Well I can understand that 
 I you know I kind of like the Cowboys too
 They've had some great games in the past
 Uh-huh 
 me too
 It wasn't nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys I'll tell you
 He lives in the Dallas area now as a matter of fact
 Well actually it's probably closer to Fort Worth 
 but it's it's in the same area 
 He bought uh bought a big horse farm out in a little town called Roanoke Texas
 But he pops up on the Dallas scene quite often
 As a matter of fact there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job
 I don't know 
 he'd be good at it 
 He's such a motivator he primarily you know with the quarterbacks
 That would be his specialty 
 I wished I wished they could work something 
 I really like him 
 I really do
 Yeah 
 okay 
 I'd love to see Dallas and Houston play in a Super Bowl 
 That would be really great
 That may not ever happen 
 I don't know
 Uh Houston has had some wonderful talent you know down through the years 
 and in the earlier years they really had some super teams
 That's right 
 He certainly is 
 he's very good
 He's very good
 That's right 
 Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia I guess last year 
 but he's no longer with the team 
 <> So you're right 
 there are very few Black quarterbacks or at least that are starting anyway
 How do you think the Steelers are going to do this year 
 You have any idea
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 that was just such super team
 Yeah 
 Well that's a tough 
 it would be tough to do 
 it really would
 They have such a super team for years that won what four Super Bowls
 Four in a row 
 I don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not
 Yeah 
 That's right 
 And 
 That's right
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 He may have been the last of the old guard 
 I don't know
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 they had such a super team
 Have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday
 I see
 There's quite a bit of activity now 
 of course they had so many you know nice uh choices because their record was so lousy the last few years 
 They picked up you know quite a few of the 
 of course you never know 
 The guys they pick you know m- may never play a game 
 You jus- never know 
 it's it's a gamble 
 it really is
 They may get hurt or not be able to participate at that level if you know 
 Ever been
 Probably an old guy that played probably before you were born 
 his name was Sam Huff 
 He used to play for the New York Giants
 That was one of the toughest guys that I've ever seen in my life as far as you know dedication 
 He just went all out every single play
 Of course there have been some other great ones too Dick Butkis and Bradshaw you know 
 there's been so many
 But if I had to pick one I would probably pick Sam Huff as a matter of fact
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 He is 
 he is 
 of course the- a quarterback has a big ego
 They really d- they have to have 
 they can't survive
 They always think they can win you know which is the way it should be
 Boy he never gave up I'll tell you
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Oh yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 absolutely 
 I can't disagree with that 
 They were super players 
 they really were
 They really 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 highlights yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's kind of funny too as a matter of fact 
 Some of them a a bit embarrassing 
 Yeah 
 well they make mistakes too I guess
 Absol- 
 Absolutely
 Uh-huh 
 oh they They take such a beating
 Absolutely 
 I don't know how they do it 
 It's it must just take a hundred percent concentration I guess because they know they're going to get hit 
 it's just a matter of how hard you know or where
 Oh absolutely 
 They look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem
 Gosh what a beating 
 they really do take a beating 
 they really do
 I think he was just probably a passing phenomena I think 
 I don't know 
 I I'm knowing what you know 
 of course Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach is knowing his you know knowing of his temperament I'm just surprised he ever you know kept the guy around 
 I really am 
 He's such a he's about a half hot head anyway such a temper
 Uh-huh 
 That's right yeah 
 absolutely 
 There's just so much mass there I guess they just can't 
 I don't know you know 
 I 
 probably the guy is you know probably physically strong 
 I you know 
 obviously not very fast
 But I guess it's just like you say a mass that nobody can seem t- to get out of the way 
 As far as him scoring touch downs you know I think that was kind of weird
 I don't know 
 Dallas has a guy uh his name is Nate Newton 
 now he has a real weight problem too 
 He fights it every single year 
 but he manages to still keep playing 
 but he has a terrible weight problem
 They wa- 
 the coaches watch him all year long 
 They they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not you know completely out of control
 But I guess most every team has so- has someone like that 
 I don't 
 Absolutely they get bigger and bigger it seems every year
 I guess you have to to you know to stay in the game I guess
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 sure 
 well you'd have to uh I would have to say you know someone like Montana I guess who's done so well for so many years
 Yeah 
 his age is about to catch up with him though
 He's no Spring chicken anymore
 And like you say Warren Moon's an excellent 
 Warren Moon's an excellent 
 But he's very exciting to watch
 Uh-huh 
 sure 
 Uh-huh 
 absolutely
 Uh I'm 
 obviously he's a very good quarterback 
 I'd I never was you know too a whole lot of a big fan you know
 Yeah 
 he may uh-huh
 Yes 
 he was 
 I believe that's right at one point in time 
 Ye- 
 but he's a very young fellow
 Yeah 
 of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot if he's got a good supporting cast you know
 If not he gets beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway 
 you kno- 
 we- 
 Dallas did better last year 
 hopefully they'll do better this year
 That's right 
 Yeah 
 Miami's had some down years too
 But they all do I guess 
 it's it's cyclical I guess As the players get older get slower
 Yeah 
 with 
 yeah 
 Oh yes very much so 
 Hip injuries and things like that yeah
 Yeah 
 that that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game
 That's right 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I read some time well not too long ago that the average uh professional career only lasts seven years
 So that's when you think about it that's really not a very long time of course
 But if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years you know
 That's right yeah *[[should this be two slash units]]
 that's ri- 
 That's that's a pretty short career on average
 Of course they play their you know cards right and do some good investments they'll you know they'll do all right
 But a lot of them don't unfortunately
 Yeah 
 they they're always branded you know as a bunch of outlaws 
 and if their if their you know arrest record won't let abl- won't let them play anywhere else they seem to go to they seem to go to the Raiders
 But that just may be you know perceived 
 you know perception 
 I don't know
 Al Davis is he's a kind of strange character strange strange looking guy 
 Apparently he's kind of a wild guy 
 I don't really know for sure 
 They've had some excellent teams though obviously
 I'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play 
 they keeping talk about you know going
