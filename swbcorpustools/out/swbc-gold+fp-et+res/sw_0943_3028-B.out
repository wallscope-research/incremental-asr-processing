 Uh-huh
 Oh I didn't I didn't quite hear all of it
 Right 
 Well I I really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else
 Well a little bit for the price 
 but uh I think that as far as quality of food goes the m- some of the most expensive places I've been had the w- the really the the worst quality of food
 Really 
 Um a lot of places that even don't look don't look like much
 Some of the some of the best food I have ever had was out of a outside inside of a place that we drove up 
 and I was like I'm not eating in there 
 Are you nuts 
 And uh we went in 
 and it was the m- it was the most wonderful food
 Yeah
 I'm serious
 Um a lot of uh one place that we went just recently uh was to Atchafalaya 
 No 
 that's not right
 That's not right 
 That's not right
 <> What's the name of that restaurant 
 <> Where at 
 <> The Hari Krishna 
 <> Oh Kalachandji's 
 Kalachandji's 
 It's all vegetarian 
 and it it was just fabulous 
 my husband was aghast because I ate turnip greens and liked it
 Um Kalachandji's 
 It's uh it's a Hari Krishna run restaurant
 Yes
 Uh I think so 
 It should be
 Uh it starts with a K
 So K A L A I think C H A N D
 That should get you close enough to to be able to find it 
 I think it's uh probably listed in the restaurants you know
 But it's uh it's just fabulous food
 Well we like Arby's As far as fast food goes
 Oh really 
 Why
 Oh no 
 no 
 no 
 Someone has been lying to you 
 What they use is roast beef
 That's what 
 Oh my goodness
 I'm surprised 
 My dad worked for Arby's for several years
 Yeah
 Well that's happened before
 But we like good s- uh w- we're we like Mexican food
 And stuff like that 
 And so um 
 A health food
 Like like 
 name one 
 I'm not sure what you're talking about
 Huh
 I don't guess I've ever been to anything like that 
 so I really don't have anything to compare it to
 It would be good I think
 uh I don't know how expensive they are 
 It sounds like that it would probably 
 For one person
 Oh 
 A bit 
 Yeah 
 I I won't really be interested in going to in going there Because I feel like I'm I'm paying you know five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that I could get along quite well without 
 Yeah 
 Maybe maybe that 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I could see that then maybe
 Yeah 
 I like the the seafood that they when they had it you know the broiled 
 Yeah 
 Probably that's true 
 But I know a lot of their a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things that you can't really get away from the fried
 Now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken
 That's one of my husband's pet peeves 
 He doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak you know
 Oh really
 Oh catfish is wonderful
 Oh really
 Really
 Why
 Oh
 Huh
 That's too bad because I'm probably not going to stop eating it 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 That's true
 Oh on one hand I see that 
 and on the other hand uh my older sister remembers when uh at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which i- I guess had a half-life of oh five years if they sit empty on dry land
 So they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically
 And then they take these things that will rust 
 and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more
 Oh 
 And then they wouldn't think 
 They were floating around 
 so they shot holes in them to sink them
 And this is before I was born
 So we're taking thirty years ago this happened
 and and who's you know the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent
 You can't get away from it 
 so I think To some point 
 yeah 
 you know So there's you know there's some things I think we can av- we you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like you know 
 this is not in my control
 So I'm either going to be I'm either going to starve to death 
 or I'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as I possibly can you know
