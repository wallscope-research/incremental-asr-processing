 Okay 
 are you on any kind of uh regular exercise plan
 Step classes 
 What's that
 Oh instead of hopping and jumping you just step 
 and Oh okay
 Huh
 I probably couldn't do that because of my knee 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I've I've kind of gotten out of the habit myself 
 it's 
 I guess what I do now is I play softball right now 
 that's about 
 well right now I'm on two teams 
 so it's four nights a week
 But uh uh so I enjoy it 
 but as far as you know uh 
 instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there I went and bought a weight bench and don't ever hardly use it
 I need to make myself do that
 What school you going to
 Oh 
 Now what's what's toning 
 Is that lift- lifting weights
 Oh okay
 Isometrics stuff like that
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I stayed in pretty good shape during school 
 I played baseball all the way through 
 and you know working out six hours a day usually six or seven days a week that kind of kept us all in pretty good shape 
 But uh ever ever since I got out of school you know just jumped right into the job 
 and I guess the job that I'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule
 *[[listen; possible typo stuff = tough]] Because I work some weird hours and do some traveling
 Yeah
 No 
 I didn't have well much of a problem 
 we I guess I went to a small Baptist school 
 and we had about when I was there maybe thirteen hundred people
 So it's pretty small 
 Yeah
 But I usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant
 So 
 Uh we've got a one story house now 
 that's that's enough 
 I guess I push the lawn mower around 
 that's fairly regular 
 Yeah
 What 
 just because yo- you don't like to or because because you won't be able to
 Oh if you do if you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running
 We've we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough 
 No 
 you can't forget how to ride a bike
 Yeah
 Now when I was going to 
 I I went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred 
 well when we were at this junior college uh our coach you know 
 we 
 one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics 
 and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting
 So they uh 
 it was a regular 
 we had it for course credit
 but still it was pretty high impact stuff 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and she'd uh you know 
 most of the guys were all in one class 
 so she'd kind of lay it on occasionally you know 
 First at eight I think we had 
 eight o'clock in the morning was our class
 Wake up
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I think my wife has some
 Uh-huh 
 Or sand even some of them 
 well no 
 they're elastic 
 so I guess it wouldn't be sand
 Huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 So are you going to get into instructing 
 Well what are you studying
 Oh okay 
 not in the not in the aerobic instructor type field
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 the uh the some of the Nautilus equipment that I started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting 
 they they they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups with those things 
 but man they are it ut- 
 I don't know 
 to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there and workout and then drive back 
 A little negative reinforcement there while you're going
 Yeah
 yeah 
 that's that's where I'm really starting to get noticeable
 I'm just getting real soft in the middle
 Uh-huh 
 I haven't really started to put on a lot of weight 
 I'm I guess I probably put on about ten nine or ten pounds since I stopped playing which was about four years ago
 But I've just myself I just notice myself just really real soft 
 and I'm sure I don't have near the endurance that I did 
 But I I intend I keep saying I intend to get back into it
 <> I just need to put the old nose to the grindstone 
 I I I guess at that point it would turn into a task 
 I don't consider it fun doing that 
 but 
 Next weekend
 All right
 Yeah
 oh no 
 yeah 
 there there's no no question the the end result is great 
 and I enjoyed you know 
 we 
 when I was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired you know 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh I still don't 
 but That's a problem
 Well good luck on your graduation and your 
 Yeah 
 you too
 Bye
