 Uh yeah 
 currently we have a poodle
 Yeah 
 uh it's uh miniature
 Yeah
 Well um I wouldn't uh I definitely wouldn't dispute that 
 it it's actually my wife's dog uh I I became part owner six months ago when we got married 
 but uh it uh definitely responds to uh to authority 
 and I've had dogs in the past 
 and uh it seems it seems to uh respond real well 
 it it 
 she's she's picked up a lot of things uh just just by uh teaching by force I guess is what I'd like to say
 Well about a year I guess
 It just turned two I believe
 Pretty much 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Okay
 Oh that sounds interesting
 Oh that's that's neat 
 How about how big then
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Most definitely
 Yeah
 Oh I wouldn't doubt it 
 yeah
 Well that's understandable 
 yeah 
 it's uh 
 Uh-huh
 Okay
 Oh
 Yeah
 Okay
 Yeah 
 definitely
 Yeah 
 I can honestly say we do uh we uh just recently put a security system in our house 
 and so now uh in order to uh to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her uh uh locked up in the the master bedroom during the day 
 and then she's got the the bedroom and the bathroom to for free run during the day 
 but we've always got uh got a nose and tongue pressed up against the window when we come walking up to the front door
 She's definitely ready to get out and run around/
 Really
 Oh wow
 Yeah
 Okay
 Okay
 Okay
 Most definitely
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 that's uh definite security involved in uh in a dog like that
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Yeah 
 that's interesting
 Yeah 
 I know our dog has had uh some different reactions 
 she's never really been around children 
 and uh if if the child is is pretty straight forward um she's fine 
 If if a child is a little intimidated she'll jump around and and yip and bark quite a bit 
 and if the child gets scared uh she's still trying to play but she doesn't completely understand what's going on 
 and we've had a little confusion with with uh with younger kids
 But uh you know that's 
 it's a matter of exposure really 
 Um we uh took her home to uh my family's place in South Dakota 
 and she was the one that was intimidated then
 There was about seven kids ranging from about uh three years to ten years running around the house all at one time you know come to visit Grandpa and Grandma 
 and the dog kind of kind of felt out of place then because she was she was being fed and everything else from all directions 
 She really didn't know how to handle herself
 She really did 
 she just uh 
 she she was alm- she was just inundated with with all the attention 
 Uh she she kind of she kind of sat and it all in for a little while 
 and then she'd go get back in and try to play and and what not 
 but uh it was it was just such a such a new experience for her 
 She's only been around one and and sometimes two people at the most 
 so uh 
 Uh pardon
 Oh it's uh Mitzi
 Yeah
 Oh okay
 Yeah
 I I see
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 I had uh a similar uh experience 
 I I grew up on a farm 
 so I always had uh outdoor pets 
 and uh the dog I had when I moved to Dallas about five years ago was a uh Springer Spaniel black Lab cross 
 And he was a real a real lovable type but uh definitely not an apartment type animal 
 so he uh he had to stay home
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it really was 
 He uh apparently had a tough time with it for a little while 
 and then he he got he came to accept the fact that Mom and Dad were his company from then on 
 but uh 
 Yeah
 Okay
 Most definitely
 Well that's great
 That sounds real good
 You too
