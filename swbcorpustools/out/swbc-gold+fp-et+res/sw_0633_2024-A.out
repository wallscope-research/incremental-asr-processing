 Okay
 Uh what kind of books do you enjoy reading
 Oh
 Right 
 I've read that one too 
 I only had a subscription once 
 but my mother always gave me hers 
 and I I really enjoyed you know all the little things that you find out about Texas
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well um I have an interest in art 
 so I frequently purchase and read uh books mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment
 And uh oh I guess I like a variety of things uh lots of fiction uh type books 
 Uh right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about uh the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history
 That's fairly interesting
 Yeah 
 I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement 
 How about you
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well uh maybe I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement
 they are 
 but I don't label it as such
 Well I don't know um 
 I uh have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but uh I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things 
 but uh they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself You know ge- getting your yourself in gear to uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do Convincing you that you need to get on with it
 Yes
 Sure
 Um
 Yeah 
 yeah
 I don't know 
 I'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen King 
 That's a little little heavy for me
 Yeah
 Well I guess I also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot at work
 Oh yeah 
 you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other 
 but uh I think sometimes the word is a little over used 
 but 
 Yeah
 Okay 
 well any other comments
 Well we just started 
 right
 Well you too 
 and uh good-bye
 Good-bye
