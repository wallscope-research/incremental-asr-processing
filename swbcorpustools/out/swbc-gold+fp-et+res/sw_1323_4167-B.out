 Right 
 yeah
 Yeah
 I I think I'd agree 
 A a s- similar method of getting the news with me too 
 It's uh uh C N N has been a welcome addition to the T V scene here in the last uh number of years 
 Uh p- prior to cable you know you didn't get much news off of normal uh television broadcasts
 Uh just usually pretty local in in nature 
 and and I like uh C N N because you get some world world events too uh which is not too common on on the other format newspapers and so forth
 That that's true you know 
 You hardly ever see uh headline articles about the uh either the economics or or other wor- news events going on in either of those countries
 Uh whereas if you pick up a a European paper you know uh it all the surrounding countries Soviet Union and everything has uh major news uh articles in them
 Yeah
 I'm I'm currently living in Dallas 
 and it it won't even give it the back section 
 You just never see you just never see anything about it 
 uh which is a shame because you go to other countries uh 
 and and they carry quite a bit about the U S on the other hand 
 And if you go up to uh Canada those people are usually pretty uh familiar with the politics going on and and the news U S 
 and we're pretty uh limited in our understanding of of leaders up in Canada or Mexico
 You just don't know what's going on 
 I'd I 
 every once in awhile I have to travel overseas 
 and lately I've taken the taken a little shortwave radio uh around and picking up the B B C 
 and it's sort of like uh a C N N too 
 You you can tune into some stations 
 and you get some like thirty minute summaries of of news events 
 Uh I occasionally get into some of the middle eastern uh area 
 and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all 
 There's not much in the way of television in some of those places 
 Uh but that's a good point about about the neighboring countries 
 I hadn't really thought about it 
 but I guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you know there was a a 
 what is it called 
 is it Meech Lake Accord
 Or or i- that's just something uh I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of 
 and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and you know picked up a a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it 
 And and c- came 
 it was a big thing going on there 
 and I came back here 
 and nothing in the papers
 I didn't see a thing about it 
 So it's uh we've got a long ways to go I guess 
 It's improved 
 And like I say with C N N and and uh the cable news 
 Even even there's uh uh 
 it's sor- it's semireligious in some respects 
 But what is it 
 It's uh I mean it's news is not not that way 
 uh oh I'm trying to think of the channel 
 The the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR
 Uh I it surprised me 
 I've caught it a few times 
 and they they do some pretty good news 
 Uh seemingly unbiased news broadcasts 
 Uh uh the the title of the network is sort of surprising 
 You'd think it would carry mostly religious 
 but it it doesn't seem to 
 So I'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too uh and catch something maybe a little different than than C N N might be covering 
 Uh some more in- interest type topics in in other countries 
 But it's kind of world world uh network too
