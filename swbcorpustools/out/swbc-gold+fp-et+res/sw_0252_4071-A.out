 Well Jackie uh on taxes I I guess I would have to say that I that my opinion is that I do think American's are paying too much in taxes 
 Uh what's your feeling about that
 Right 
 uh where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both
 Uh uh-huh 
 In New Hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes 
 No income tax and no sales tax
 Uh we tax business uh eight percent 
 businesses are taxed eight percent 
 and we have what we call the five B s Uh th- for our taxes Booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets gambling
 So uh we do have a very low tax rate 
 but you know combined with the federal income tax I think that American's generally do pay too much in taxes 
 and 
 Uh-huh <>
 Well that's nice
 Nice nice to get a refund
 Uh-huh 
 Do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh we are getting value for it
 Yeah 
 Uh my my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state 
 and they say they are going to send some back 
 it's like giving yourself a tra- it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion 
 You know what I mean
 Uh it it really uh 
 I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because Right because uh there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect 
 and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first 
 and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you
 Uh-huh
 That it 
 Uh-huh
 Well it does it it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend 
 Uh it's almost like they will spend as much as the they're allowed to collect You know
 Uh there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax Uh ten percent or thirteen percent 
 There would be no figuring 
 you would take your income tax 
 you would have a certain amount 
 you would take you total salary
 those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes 
 and then there would be a set amount for however many people you know dependent you have 
 and you would just pay a flat tax No exemptions no deductions or anything else after you know after you figure up who's in your family
 And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S 
 and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with
 Yeah
 I I'd like to see something like that 
 I think it would be fairer 
 and it would put a you know a lot of the tax attorneys our of business 
 and I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail 
 but I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans
 it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes
 It doesn't seem fair to me
 Right
 I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high I I if I am not mistaken aren't they for your state 
 What is do you know what your state income tax rate is
 Twenty percent
 Just you just pay it huh 
 You're like you're like my daughter who is in college down in Massachusetts 
 and uh she works as a waitress 
 and she is attending college full time also
 and she sends her taxes to me 
 and I figure them up 
 She really has no idea 
 She gets a refund check 
 and
