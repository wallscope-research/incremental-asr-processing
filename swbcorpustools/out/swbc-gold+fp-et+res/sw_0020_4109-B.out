 Oh okay
 Okay 
 we can start off there 
 Let's just get started
 If you don't want to you know uh talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it 
 Right
 Yep
 So so you think uh I think that a short work week is real nice 
 Uh I have a thirty-seven hour work week 
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 it all makes sense to me 
 Although there may be more crime if people have more leisure time 
 It's not clear 
 And that 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 So 
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well well I do wo- uh research in computer science 
 and I've just been doing that for a few years now 
 so uh I my job has most of the benefits I want 
 Uh what I really like is I like being 
 like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as I'd like 
 but uh you know that's just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of 
 uh they also 
 a really important thing to me is when they uh they pay for continuing education 
 Like I I get night courses that they they'll cover right now 
 and that's really good 
 yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
