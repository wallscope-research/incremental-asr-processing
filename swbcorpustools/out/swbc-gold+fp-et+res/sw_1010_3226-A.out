 Okay 
 the topic of the conversation is national health insurance and the pros and cons and do I do we think that the government should finance it 
 What is your opinion
 You say yes
 I have heard someone else uh say that uh the Canadian health insurance is absolutely excellent
 and one of the ways that they're financing it is they have an exorbitant tax on their cigarettes
 This is evidently this is one of the ways that they're paying for the program plus discouraging the people to quit smoking so they don't have to pay out as many uh benefits on like lung cancer and things like this
 Yeah 
 we 
 Oh my word Lynn
 That's horrible
 Well we're fortunate in that we so far knock on wood most of us have been relati- real healthy 
 so we don't have a lot of medical bills
 Yeah 
 but what worries me is the fact that I don't like the government telling me who I can see and who I can't see
 Uh-huh
 Are they
 Well I know that Gre- James had it
 I beg your pardon
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I know that when James was with Continental Steel McCullum was part of that 
 and and that's good 
 But I also heard for instance like uh my friend's daughter was on it through Texas Instruments 
 and she was on that Kaiser Permanente 
 and they had screwed up her appointment 
 and when she went in she had to take whichever doctor was available 
 and they 
 she would have had to wait like two months to get the doctor she wanted
 But then again I guess you can even do that in McCullum
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well that's true 
 and that still goes on
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well you know it uh 
 how do you think we're going to pay for it 
 More and more taxes 
 I know that it's getting to the point that the insurance doesn't pay that much on catastrophic illnesses
 They don't pay anything on uh implants or transplants 
 and you know people are needing these 
 and the average person can't afford you know a heart or a kidney on just their own
 Uh-huh
 Good grief
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Very true
 Well I know they have the Medicaid you know for those that have trouble 
 and I know that like we have the uh prescription cards which 
 that's helped bunches
 and wonder if the insurance companies are fighting the national health 
 or wonder if they're wanting it
 That they are wanting
