 Uh I think uh actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the uh working for a large corporation 
 And for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit 
 I think it's health care 
 It's what 
 I think everybody would say that
 Right 
 Belonging to a group is the belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you 
 Uh so- the uh 
 sometimes I think it's more important than salary
 Yes 
 And uh I don't know if I would rank that second 
 but uh since I have three boys uh it it can turn out to be important 
 Yeah 
 you know 
 in a in a given year dental ca- dental expenses can really kill you
 Right
 Right 
 It's uh 
 Right 
 uh and then uh uh if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodony will
 Uh I guess that would be up there 
 Uh I'm not sure if I would rank uh how I would rank that next to say compared to retirement 
 or uh uh uh pretax savings was another thing that I think is a a great a great benefit 
 And I I think it's really something that the uh the government ought to encourage more because uh there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in uh Germany and Japan Uh 
 Right 
 When you have the when you have the uh the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has and you can uh offer some incentive 
 and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up uh the savings and the that you wouldn't otherwise do 
 and 
 Leave
 You know I I don't think so yet 
 They may have uh just plain parental leave which either one can take
 Uh I their uh I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short Uh
 uh uh I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks
 Right 
 and uh 
 There 
 There ought to be uh uh some compromise that could where uh where the person would be guaranteed a uh career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh in exchange for a longer period of time
 It's uh it's so important to families then 
 and uh and yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up
 Uh
 That 
 Yeah 
 you're right 
 I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I that I would most like to see uh changed Uh the uh parental leave
 Right 
 Right 
 They do it by shortchanging their kids 
 There's no other way uh unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely Uh
 people moving as much 
 And uh they just it's just a terrible choice 
 you shouldn't have to make it
 Uh you're right
 And uh 
 Oh right 
 Boy 
 would I like to have that 
 Yeah
 Oh listen I have friends in a lot of different cities 
 If you just fly me there 
 I'll take care of that 
 Right 
 So and uh I guess the
