 Okay
 Um I like the idea of nursing homes as a as a growing choi- the choices you have in nursing homes now whereas used to you used to have only you put you know 
 when when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves 
 and there was no other choice 
 You couldn't take them in your own home 
 then they went into a nursing home 
 You know maybe you lived too far away to care for them
 or your daily job or whatever prevented it 
 But um I like the choices you have now where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some basically have a independent life-style but assisted care
 And then if things deteriorate they can go to a second level which is you know like where they prepare their meals for them
 and and they still live somewhat independently 
 but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals
 And then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level which is full care you know where some people can't where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed
 and they can't get around 
 but then they have full care 
 But I really like those those options now 
 and and I think about it more often because my husband's parents are they're very active right now 
 but they're seventy-five and and seventy-two 
 So that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as I see these things because of their age
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 that's some of the things I would find important before I I would look into that for a person is is is like you're saying a good mix of people who have the same interests
 And uh and the programs 
 here they have different uh besides just different levels within the same program they have different types of programs 
 They have several areas 
 They have one area in town where the people 
 I guess a lot of it comes with money 
 I this this one area is a bit more expensive 
 and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life 
 But but things that people where they have similar interests
 Like you're saying 
 and the programs that they have where where some of them will have dances once a week
 and some of them sponsor different crafts 
 and they go to the arboretum to see things 
 and they make sure that if they want to go to church there's a bus there
 [ And it'll + [ or you know or ] someone will ] transport them to a specific church even though it's you know maybe it's thirty minutes away 
 because it's a big you know Dallas area is a big metropolitan area
 But a lot of these places have have churches or have have individual transportation 
 That's that's something I'd look for something that would make me happy personally if I had to live there
 Because I don't think a lot of people really even in the nice ones and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home
 So I think those kinds of things to make it more homelike and to make it more um enjoyable for them That'd that'd be one thing I'd look for along with the uh health care aspects to make sure they had you know that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Are overmedicated too
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that's one of the things that that we don't think about as we get older and the the money that it now requires to uh be in one of these places 
 Because some of these people that are just on social security 
 and if they don't have any living relatives 
 perhaps they never had children 
 or if their children you know passed away before they did they can be in some places that are you know that that are not good
 Or they they have very minimum minimal care 
 and the the care that they are getting the people who are giving it are pro- are paid at a minimum wage 
 and they just do- they don't care as much
 And and like you said they're trying to make it the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything
 That certainly would be something to to watch for 
 Because you've got with some of them being some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in 
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 so you've 
 Yeah 
 you've got to really strike a balance in what kind of care what kind of level of care you need and then what you can unfortunately what you can afford at the same time
 Well like there are other communities too that aren't necessarily a nursing home 
 I had an aunt who lived in a small town in Texas that um was in a 
 it was a it was a housing division 
 Each person had their own little bitty house that they had built 
 and it was um supplemented 
 their they were most of them were on social security 
 and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government 
 But it was this little bitty one bedroom house 
 but it was a separate house 
 and they had a living room and a bedroom and a kitchen and a bathroom 
 So they still had they had and they had people who came in who um supervised th- all these houses 
 were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block
 And they had a a supervisory um 
 wasn't a house really 
 it was it was more like um a headquarters or something anyway where they they staffed it three shifts a day so that someone if they needed someone they could ring 
 and and someone could come to their house
 And that and they always cooked 
 then they had they had the choice you know 
 they lived in their own little house
 They had their own possessions still in there to some ex- you know some of them 
 And they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to and their own dinner 
 and they always had somebody come in for lunch 
 But they had people who did you know they didn't have to mess with the yard
 They had people who did the yard 
 and they had a maid that uh uh service that came in and cleaned everybody's house 
 So they didn't have to worry about that
 And it was really a nice it was really a nice compromise especially because she felt like she was still living in her own house
 And she still had her own couch and her own bed 
 and it it really helped a lot 
 and she was a lot more comfortable 
 and she didn't resent like having to be in a situation because she still had a lot of her own possessions
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 it would be hard to
 That's that's why this 
 she was she felt that way too 
 but when it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff
 And I guess that that 
 it was a pilot program I think where she lived 
 so it's probably not widely available
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh
 Yeah
 That's good
 Everybody needs some sense of responsibility
 An even even if it's just a little bit 
 Yeah
 So it's it's more like living with a big in a big house where it's your turn to to set the table like you're saying or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time
 Yeah 
 that would be nice
 Yes 
 unless they're at a point where they're mentally incapacitated 
 Like you're saying with Alzheimer's and stuff they're going to be some people who have to be there whether they want to or not 
 and that's when it's important to really check out the medical aspects of it when you're when you're in something like that that they'll get the kind of medical care they want without they need without overdoing it Without doing something to make this you know to keep like you're saying to keep them still to make the staff happy
 So
