 Yeah 
 it's just it's so easy nowadays you know 
 and it's uh especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave 
 and it be ready in just a few minutes 
 Yeah
 All week 
 Well we've done that too 
 There's just my husband and I 
 and he he sometimes makes a huge spot o- uh pot of spaghetti
 and you know we're eating it for a week and a half 
 and I kind of get sick of it after he 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Right
 Right
 Um I have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas
 it's it's really good 
 I got it from a friend of mine that I used to work with
 and uh every time I've served it everybody just loves it
 So that's that's one of my favorite things to make
 What about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well what do you put in it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Ooh 
 that sounds good
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Ooh 
 that sounds good
 Is done 
 right
 Yeah 
 that sounds good too
 I've got a um a great recipe for cheese cake
 I don't know if you get SOUTHERN LIVING 
 but 
 they have one 
 if you like to cook they have 
 every recipe I've tried out of that has been a really good one
 and um you know every month they've got all different kinds of recipes 
 but I got one in there about a year or so ago on cheese cake 
 and it's just a regular cheese cake 
 and then you can put raspberry uh topping on it
 but inside the cheese cake uh recipe you put um lemon peel and orange peel
 and it's just enough to taste it you know when when when you're eating the cheese cake 
 and it is wonderful 
 but it takes a long time because you have to cook it for forty-five minutes and then you turn the oven off and you leave it in the oven for another forty-five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another forty-five minutes and then you're supposed to um I think chill it to room temperature
 so sometimes I'll do that overnight and then put the topping on the next day 
 but it's it's very good
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 No 
 it's not
 Right
 It does 
 and it it it is really good
 Right 
 Oh sometimes 
 but I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means
 I've been to you know some wine tastings up in Napa Valley
 but um you know and I learned a little bit about them then 
 but you know what would be fun they have some of those classes you can take
 yeah 
 and then there's places um 
 do you live in Dallas
 okay 
 there's places here that um offer 
 I think it's like once a month 
 you can go and to a particular restaurant or whatever 
 and you can kind of take a cooking class
 and then you get to eat everything afterwards 
 and then they also go into the wines you know to serve with you know different types of of meals and that kind of thing 
 and it sounds like it's a lot of fun 
 We have some friends who've done that 
 and they've really enjoyed it
 Yeah 
 this place is called like Medina's or Messina's Kitchen or something like that
 Yeah 
 it it sounds like like it
