 Well I usually keep up with news by watching A B C news on television and reading the papers here the local DALLAS MORNING NEWS 
 and then I also take the WALL STREET JOURNAL
 Yeah 
 well I well I d- 
 at the office I generally catch the WALL STREET JOURNAL at lunchtime
 I use part of my lunch period to uh read the WALL STREET JOURNAL
 Then uh I read the the newspaper at home generally in the evening 
 I'd rather sleep the extra thirty minutes in the morning
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that's uh what we do to 
 it we're never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television
 so we catch the ten o'clock news
 But I catch the news on the radio coming to and from work 
 but radio news is is rather short Uh
 most of the news stations most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour
 And if you catch the news stations uh you don't catch that much in the car
 Yeah 
 but uh 
 Yeah 
 I have the same situation 
 I tried the news magazines like TIME NEWSWEEK U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT
 and they'd just stack up 
 I wouldn't find time to read them 
 You have to have time to sit down and concentrate on on the stories 
 or e- all of a sudden you look and there's three uh three weeks worth laying on the coffee table 
 and you wind up throwing them out without reading them
 Because it's too much trouble to try and catch up 
 so have to depend 
 I guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that I don't think that uh my children even read newspapers other than the T V guide section
 There's is all uh strictly television news
 Oh yeah
 Yeah 
 Right 
 it's the same thing with the news magazines like TIME and and the other magazines
 It's hard to celebr- uh to celebrate to separate the news from the comment because in the way it's presented their opinions is print or presented as being the news
 And so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news
 That's right 
 Right
 Well so many of them also come through 
 and they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time Whether it be the homeless or uh cancer or whatever 
 and then they devote uh an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind
 And uh uh particularly the local television Uh I know the the Wednesday's Child bit 
 and they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something 
 I'm not saying that's not important
 but they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects
 Yeah 
 s- 
 That's yeah that makes sense 
 We uh again 
 like I say by the time I read the newspaper it's the the it's that morning's news from the day before 
 and I'm reading it in the evening 
 so 
 I'm a I'm about a day behind most of the time anyway 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 we we 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 my wife and I feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own
 It's always there's something going on all the time uh 
 you don't really have time to sit down and and thoroughly read a newspaper
 As a matter of fact I read the Sunday paper this evening
 We had such a busy day yesterday 
 Didn't find time to even read it
 Yeah 
 well that's about all then 
 Nice talking with you
 Same to you
 Bye
