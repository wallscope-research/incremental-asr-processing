 So do you have do you have the long 
 I guess not not if there's 
 see I was raised in New York 
 but I guess up there you all don't have too long of a growing season do you
 Do do you do your own gardening
 Do you
 Huh See I got mine in 
 well let's see 
 I put in pepper plants this weekend
 Yeah 
 I got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen 
 and I enjoy tinkering with it you know 
 it's pretty hot down here during the Summer 
 we hit you know a hundred hundred and two sometimes
 but you know we don't do too much during the Summer as far as tomatoes and stuff like that
 Yeah 
 I can usually I can put in oh probably mid-March I can put anything in the ground you know beets and onions and stuff like that
 But then I have to wait for my 
 tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks
 as soon as we're sure we're not going to have another freeze go ahead finish it
 Yeah 
 We've had just a few you know that freezes a little here and there 
 but every once in a while we get a freeze around the middle of April
 and it's pretty tough
 No 
 I work uh
 I'm only forty years old 
 I have to work
 Uh I I really enjoy it 
 it gives me time outdoors
 and you know I'm a golfer 
 but it gives me time outdoors and time around my house
 and I burned my grass off here in the last couple of days getting ready to start to the Spring season and see if I can grow me another nice lawn 
 I usually have a pretty nice lawn 
 it's a lot of work you know 
 but it's 
 Yeah 
 it is
 Uh-huh
 Oh yeah
 We're going through that
 we going through the dust storms down here now
 so but I uh what I did with my garden is I have a a two by six frame that's five by ten 
 I have two of them sitting side by side
 and then I put uh like a black plastic 
 it's really not a black plastic 
 They call it Wedet 
 and I put that down 
 and then I put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that
 and I use a one of those black poker hoses that actually oozes water every where
 so I waste it up and down there a couple of times 
 and I only have to water about two hours a week
 and it's pretty nice
 Especially during the Summer it keeps everything wet instead of wilting
 Oh
 Oh you have a spring
 how nice
 Uh-huh
 Oh that's that's pretty nice
 But you actually enjoy it huh
 Do you
 Get out there on your hands and knees and crawl around
 I I can imagine 
 You all have much trouble up there with insects 
 or 
 With the worms
 Yeah 
 I have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs and haven't figured out how to get rid of those yet
 Yeah 
 I try to
 no 
 I uh uh try not to use any insecticides at all 
 I try not to even use insecticides on my lawn
 but I sometimes I can't manage
 Yeah
 Well mine's full of dandelions now 
 so 
 No 
 I never have 
 I don't know how to prepare them
 No
 Huh-uh
 Really
 Huh 
 I've never eaten dandelions 
 now I've tried dandelion wine
 but I've never tried any dandelions just to eat
 Yeah
 All right
 Yeah
 I'll try that
 I sure will 
 Oh Oh
 Yow
 So you all are into so you all are into the lawn big time huh
 Yeah 
 I only get well I guess I got 
 my my whole section of my house is probably a tenth of an acre
 then I have a pretty nice backyard
 and you know I've got enough room to throw horseshoes You know couple of other 
 No 
 and it's nice 
 I'm just inside the city limits 
 I'm probably a mile mile and a half inside the city limits 
 and I'm only a mile and a half from work
 Yeah 
 It's pretty nice
 I have the room outside I need 
 and I don't really have all the room in the house I need 
 but 
 No
 I have a question to ask you about gardening though 
 You know those 
 what are they called 
 the they called uh rolly polly bugs 
 that's what my son calls them anyway
 Rolly Polly bugs 
 The ones that roll up in a ball 
 I don't know what they're called
 They look like they've got 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 No
 It's not like a 
 no 
 You find them under bricks and all that stuff where it's moist 
 and if if you touch them they roll up in a ball
 I don't know what they call them 
 But I'm plagued with those things
 and I haven't figured out 
 I even called the nursery
 I I don't know
 Yeah 
 under bricks or under wood 
 or you know if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long they get in there 
 They usually come out at night 
 but you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that's been laying around
 No
 A slug is actually kind of slimy
 and these are just 
 he plays with them all time 
 he picks them up and rolls them across the patio
 No
 No 
 They're not real hard
 They're like a water bug of sorts 
 I don't know what they're called
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 When you touch them they roll up
 But I'm plagued with those
 You know I think it's a big problem because we're in more of a tempered zone 
 You know we don't really we only freeze down here in January and February at the most
 You know
 Yeah 
 I got fire ants too
 And you spray in one part of your lawn 
 and they just move to another part 
 So you got to spray your whole yard 
 and your your your neighbor gets them 
 and then he sprays his yard 
 and you get them back again 
 Yeah 
 But we're not doing too bad down here really you know 
 the daffodils are out 
 and 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 See mine are up and bloomed already 
 so 
 already
 They sure are pretty
 I like them 
 yeah
 And then in in my back flower bed I have uh tiger lilies
 and they bloom in you know late June mid July
 Yeah 
 they are 
 They real beautiful 
 They're they're nice and green you know 
 they're uh they're up above a foot maybe eighteen inches 
 They come up real pretty every year no problem
 Is it still pretty cool up there
 Well do you all have a 
 what kind o gra- grass do you grow up there 
 Do you grow uh Bermuda or 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 See we I have Bermuda in my yard 
 and I still have the old standby crabgrass here and there
 but Bermuda seems to be 
 Yeah 
 Bermuda seems to be pretty good down here
