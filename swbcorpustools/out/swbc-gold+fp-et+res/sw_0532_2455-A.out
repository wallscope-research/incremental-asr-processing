 Well I wondered if I was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type 
 I was afraid we might get into an argument
 Well uh I guess uh there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations for uh the roles of women 
 and uh I guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now And trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know 
 they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or you know all sorts of other things
 Oh I think so
 Absolutely 
 I I I think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days
 Sometimes I think I am going crazy trying to do it 
 but 
 Yes
 Uh yes 
 They are getting older now
 so they are not quite as much of a responsibility 
 but they are still there you know
 they still take time 
 and and I you know I still provide most of the things that go on around the house
 So uh yeah 
 and for a while I was going to school too 
 and tha- it was tough
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 But in some ways I think we are expected to do it all 
 You're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things 
 and that's where the problem is really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's a tough one 
 I've done some of both
 I when my kids were real little I was at home for a couple of different periods of time
 Oh I think the longest was less than a year 
 but still at least I was able to to spend you know those first months with them
 But uh I mostly went back to work because I was tired of doing without things
 You know the money was the issue
 But uh even now I would I would like to not have to work in some ways
 It it's kind of pull and tug
 on the other hand I can't imagine just being at home uh although I have a lot of interests and a lot of things I would like to pursue
 Uh still uh there's there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having you know a job and all that goes with that
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's a good deal 
 Where do you think this is going in the future 
 do you think things are going to change 
 or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I don't 
 yeah 
 I well I see some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children
 Uh and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the the family things work
 Uh but I don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers you know 
 It's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are 
 I don't know if they want to completely give that up
 But it would be nice if there could be an in-between a middle ground somewhere
 Yeah
 Well yeah 
 I think they they like a routine of sorts
 Well yes 
 I I like the fact that you know gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions 
 but it's still a long way from being what it ought to be
 Yeah 
 Okay 
 well I enjoyed talking to you
 All right 
 good-bye
