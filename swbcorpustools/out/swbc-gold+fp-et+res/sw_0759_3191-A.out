 Now then I think that 
 are you there
 All right 
 Do you have any one that has been in a nursing home
 Oh
 Yes
 Well what do you think can be done about that 
 what can we do
 Well I can remembe- 
 of course I'm old enough to remember when the family or the church took care of all of this
 We did not have to call on on someone else 
 and I feel 
 no you tell me how you feel about 
 Yeah
 Certainly d- 
 I worked with an agency in West Texas that they it's where they really started this concept of Meals On Wheels
 and I think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly
 If they didn't have to you know go into a kitchen 
 my mother expired just just a little over a year ago 
 and we had finally 
 she didn't want to live with either my sister or me
 but we we got found a retirement center for her 
 and it was beautiful 
 and they had all these they didn't even have nursing care there 
 So until 
 as long as mother was you know mobile and got her food 
 and she was with people with whom she enjoyed
 Sure
 Yes sir
 Uh-huh
 Being a widow I find that eating alone is one of the hardest things I have to do
 I have just recently retired 
 and I am finding it extremely hard to adjust to
 So uh mother had the little kitchenette
 and she could do all these fine things that she just ha- had a microwave had to pop her popcorn 
 Now this is wonderful
 But when it came time for a full meal then mother was able to go with people and and enjoy
 Oh I think so
 Well
