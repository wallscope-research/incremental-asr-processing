 Okay 
 what did you buy
 I'm sorry what
 Oh really
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Oh really
 Um if I had the money I think I would love to own a a B M W
 I don't know I 
 from what or 
 either that or Mercedes just because they're put together so well 
 It seems like they last forever
 Oh I don't know they're they're not as nice looking
 Uh m- 
 to me I don't know I'm sure there are some that are 
 but everyone I've seen is kind of plain 
 but 
 Sherman
 Where are you
 Dallas
 Yeah
 If I had um had the money that's just 
 I know I never would own one 
 but uh I don't know I like 
 my actual favorite cars i- were uh like the Ford Thunderbirds of nineteen eighty-five 
 I really like that body style 
 but I don't own one of those either 
 Uh Mercury Topaz
 Cheap taste cheap taste in cars okay 
 Yeah 
 they're all right it's it's a good car *[[ Looks like A37 and 39 should = 3 slash units ]] I've never had any problem with it
 *[[See parsing note above ]] I roped on Volvos then 
 I roped on Volvos then
 Oh is it
 See I don't much about them I guess
 Yeah
 Really
 Uh-huh
 Um I like anything besides Japanese 
 Of course everything has Japanese parts in them anymore 
 I don't like Japanese cars
 But uh European I don't ha- have any 
 those are the kind I usually end up liking the most
 American cars a lot of people say they they don't last long 
 but I've never had any problem with um my Mercury
