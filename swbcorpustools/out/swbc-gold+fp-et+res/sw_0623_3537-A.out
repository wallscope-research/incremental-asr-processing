 Okay 
 what do you think about uh the self insurance business
 Uh-huh
 Well I uh I understand what you're saying 
 and there's probably some truth to that 
 I think that uh generally I don't welcome added government responsibilities 
 However when a anybody can't police their own profession it eventually leads to that 
 and I think the costs and the uh the way the medical profession has every year 
 I being in my own business uh 
 in the last six years every year there's been at least minimum twenty-five percent increase in health insurance costs 
 and I think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance as as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter 
 Uh I think they're asking for it 
 I I think the medical profession is just just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over <> 
 and uh 
 Well I I think a lot of it is uh 
 I I don't disagree totally with that 
 but uh my wife this last summer uh when we were on vacation tore up her knee 
 and uh uh it was lig- ligaments uh in her knee as it turned out uh 
 she came back that uh 
 we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened 
 and uh she got home 
 and the leading orthopedic man who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come 
 he knows knee problems okay 
 if anyone does this guy knows it 
 Well she goes in 
 he says well I think this is what it is 
 but uh you better go to the hospital and have one of these M R I things 
 A thousand dollars for this uh oh magnetic uh resonance imaging type thing 
 And my wife said well do I need that 
 And he says well uh you know it it'll help me diagnose this 
 uh you know I I suggest you go have this thing 
 Insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital 
 Now a thousand uh uh dollars for thirty-five minutes 
 doctors routinely send people in for anything 
 Now for years they didn't have this 
 and they solved these problems 
 and you know 
 I said to her well look you know if you feel you got to go go 
 but I I think a thousand dollars 
 these guys 
 I don't know what it is 
 but there's no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day 
 And even if they cost a hundred two hundred five hundred thousand dollars at uh roughly a thousand dollars every half hour uh that's ridiculous 
 I I don't care what anyone says 
 You know the costs are not 
 it's a picture 
 It shouldn't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that you know reasonableness 
 But they aren't reasonable 
 Fifty a hundred dollars 
 They don't have to pay them back in three months time
 You know 
 Well I think that should be that that's a another problem 
 but that's part of our legalese problem 
 And that the government eventually will address too just you know because it's out of control 
 I I agree with you 
 You know uh I was on a jury 
 I I didn't make the jury 
 but there was a deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant
 Like it was three days after it was born 
 and he was the one that delivered it 
 And they got four attorneys 
 one guy out of Houston he introduced himself as snake so-and-so 
 and he says well anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars 
 and I says yeah 
 I got problems with 
 you know five million bucks isn't going to bring this kid back you know 
 as sorrowful as it is Uh you know if the doctor is wrong you know he should be pulled from his license 
 but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it you know 
 it it doesn't make logical sense to me 
 but uh 
 Uh that's
