 Okay 
 do you uh think we should go metric
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think that the I think what 
 I don't know what happened last time 
 I remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something 
 and 
 Yeah 
 me too
 Right 
 and and I don't quite know why it failed 
 Um I would bet the push I it I bet the push just wasn't big enough
 You know they didn't sort of encourage businesses and things to use it 
 so you know what what I think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while and then and then start phasing things out 
 so 
 Yeah
 Right 
 I was just thinking two liter bottles are what you buy and one liter bottles 
 You don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda
 Right
 And and and even though the car says miles and kilometers 
 you don't say 
 I went a hundred kilometers You know
 Yeah 
 I would I would be total loss
 I think I think though if there were some you know sort of government incentive program or something people would begin to switch over you know 
 and I think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed 
 and pardon my expression there but uh who would get really you know upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff
 But I think in the end it would make life a lot easier for people coming up
 Yeah
 Right
 Well what I think I think the difference between now and then might be this is just a might is we were the first generation that was in elementary school
 And if they kept it up 
 so let's say imagine they had kept going 
 you'd have you know two or three more generations that all now are are familiar with the metric system
 Not like could use it comfortably right now 
 but I could convert you know 
 I could carry around a little conversion card or something 
 and I could handle it for a while and then and then eventually I'd learn 
 and I think that before it was just you know just a bunch of little kids using it
 And now I think there are enough people 
 you know sort of as we get older I think others that will bring more generations in on it eventually they'll be able to make the switch 
 and we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying what are you crazy we can't understand you 
 We'll say oh it's a pain in the neck 
 but it's for the better 
 and we'll sort of deal with it I think
 I don't know 
 I I I would hope it would uh 
 it seems like it's a reasonable system 
 everything seems to be based on the same thing
 Right 
 Centimeters
 Yeah
 But I wonder if if 
 But yeah 
 right 
 Yeah 
 But I wonder if that's even something that you know they they have to change immediately 
 They could just you know sort of phase that in 
 so start you know from now 
 like from now on all licenses would have that rather than going back and changing everything you know all new licenses as of nineteen ninety-two would have it or something
 That's right
 I know the 
 and oh yeah 
 I know though at the uh at the amusement parks they say if you're under forty-two inches or something You can't walk in here
 You have to be under 
 Well I guess what what I bet what they do in that case they uh 
 see what some of them is like you know they say if you're not taller than this line
 That's right
 It would be a neat case where like where kids taught the parents I think you know
 But I don't know
 Eng- Eng- England is not
 Oh
 Yeah 
 but 
 but but virtually the rest of the world is 
 it seems like like like like sort of stupid 
 we are of course we are Americans 
 and we're supposed to be you know 
 That's right 
 and and now we're backwards
 No 
 I I I would think a a a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system makes a lot more sense
 No 
 actually no 
 Um let's see 
 it's 
 I don't know 
 Oh yeah 
 I I always forget 
 I don't even know how many ounces are in a pound 
 I just sort of make it up
 Right 
 Those those wouldn't be a problem
 Let's see 
 how many cups equal that
 I I have no idea 
 I just uh 
 I know things like you know a pint is a pound the world around or something
 That's all I know
 I I learned that because uh a friend of mine 
 I I had two friends 
 and I had more friends than that 
 but two friends of mine in college 
 I had a lot more than two 
 I promise
 Um we opened a jelly bean business
 And we sold jelly beans 
 and we had uh no idea how many you know 
 we we didn't bo- we didn't bother buying a scale
 We'd go out and just buy you know five pound bags of sixteen different flavors put it in plastic shoe boxes and and and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something
 And we we didn't bother buying a scale 
 and one of my friends was a physics one of these guys was a physics major 
 and he said well just remember a pint is a pound the world around 
 and he got the measuring cup and just measured I think a cup or two cup whatever is a pint
 Gee I think wh- I think he the calculation at home 
 and it turns out that he was actually pretty close
 If anything we were actually in favor of the consumer
 So so we were giving them a little too much 
 but that was our general tendency anyway
 Yeah 
 well we were you know we were in 
 it was it was almost like we did it for the hell of it in school 
 we really didn't make you know 
 I think we were only making seventy-five dollars each profit at the end of the year You know after after an entire semester 
 but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it
 Yeah 
 we we we tended to eat a lot 
 and our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it 
 and we had another friend um the physics major again he wasn't he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology I guess 
 and he got into a snowball fight with the jelly beans nearby 
 and he just 
 and and some snow fell into one of the cartons
 So he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off 
 And basically what we had sort of non coated beans at that point
 Uh it's just uh it's just the the same 
 they're like an outer coating 
 and there's just sort of th- this stuff you see you know it's sort of like glorified sugar 
 I don't know
 But when you rinse them off all you get is uh is uh the coating
