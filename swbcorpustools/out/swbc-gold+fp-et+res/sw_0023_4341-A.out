 Okay 
 looks like we're ready to go 
 Capital punishment uh 
 the problem I have with capital punishment is that uh uh it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime 
 but I don't think that it really actually does that 
 I don't think it deters anybody because most of the time crimes are uh are committed with a without any thought to the consequences 
 and they don't think that uh stop and think and say well maybe I shouldn't do this uh because uh I might get the gas chamber or something like that 
 They worry about it afterwards 
 and then they try and get out of it 
 And uh how about you 
 Uh-huh 
 I do too 
 yep
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 you still have to do it 
 I I 
 Uh-huh
 So you're in you're in favor of capital punishment then
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Needs to be punished or uh eliminated from society
 Right
 And then do it all over again
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Have to agree with you 
 and I'm kind of i- in favor of capital punishment also 
 I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes 
 but I tend to agree with you that uh we should have it 
 I just I don't know that it's always effective 
 but I guess we uh we're kind of stuck with it 
 It's it's a difficult uh problem isn't it to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime uh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 huh Do you think they should be punished at all or uh like go to prison uh 
 because they're not really a danger to society 
 It was almost really self defense isn't it in a case like that
 Uh-huh
 I know they put uh put them in jail sometimes I guess Uh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Um
 Uh-huh 
 You know now I wonder what you think about this 
 and uh unfortunately we we don't get to do it 
 but uh it used to be a long time ago I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment 
 So if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person 
 And I know that uh if somebody had done something to my family I would feel that I had the right to to get revenge on them 
 and uh but I I don't think that's done much anywhere 
 That's kind of drastic punishment
 Right
 Might make you feel better 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 because they're a danger to everybody else 
 Huh that's interesting 
 I have to uh agree with that 
 There's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that uh that aren't really a danger to society huh 
 and uh 
 Right
 Right 
 probably more of them then the other way around 
 Interesting 
 I don't I don't not sure 
 I I'm in Washington D C or at least very close to it 
 I'm not sure what kind of uh capital punishment we have here
 Uh-huh
