 What do you think 
 Uh-huh
 I can be 
 but go ahead 
 Right
 Right 
 We fax everything
 We don't even wait for the mail anymore
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh

 Right
 Right
 You're expected to 
 exactly 
 And I recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse 
 It should be less because we have a microwave 
 and our grandmothers had to bake brownies 
 and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes 
 but the more conveniences we have the more that's expected of us
 and we have no down time 
 Like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to
 So we keep moving 
 We don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen 
 We just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing 
 So we have no relaxation time in between
 so they say that's really a bad thing That you need to learn a lot of ways to to deal with that and get your your time in between things
 So that's good 
 That's an interesting point 
 But I just think our our family lives have changed drastically
 And I think that's ju- 
 of course a part of it is technology 
 our kids where would they be without Nintendo and you know their T V shows 
 and no- 
 some of that is really bad I think 
 But we have all single families 
 So many single families now 
 Uh a lot of working 
 both parents are working 
 So there's a whole big effect on our kids 
 and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father 
 You know I'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years
 You're probably right 
 And I'm an O B nurse 
 and that's never really occurred to me but that's that's interesting 
 I never really thought about it that way
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 That's true 
 When is this good or not good
 *[[listen]] We don't know that yet 
 Yeah 
 I don't know either
 That's true 
 Right 
 right
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 That's kind of scary 
 Huh Well that's true 
 But I 
 it's just very very different 
 and I guess every ten years it's just been very different
 So And I don't know what's going to happen 
 Uh I know what I'm seeing here at m- my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they're establishing careers 
 and they've got their homes 
 and they've got
