 All righty 
 Uh I guess our topic today is air pollution 
 And we are to just discuss what substances do you think that contribute most to air pollution as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us
 Um does your work entitle uh anything of environmental along these lines
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 It's uh hav- uh uh well 
 I work in I work in environmentals uh projects right now
 And so the Sherman deal is um uh lost a lot of hair over that project
 Uh what we run into um is we have the Texas Air Control Board T A C B that send out uh jurisdictions under which we have to uh uh reply to
 And a lot of their rules and regulation aren't real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the T A C B which is located in Austin in writing 
 and hey 
 look what we've done here at T I
 And uh we are presently uh in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to um uh 
 this is our side a- allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage 
 It's in in in tons per year Um 
 and so w- w- you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems uh that uh scrub out the N O X and uh V O C's and and ammonia compounds uh like all the acids to a certain level 
 We are very um aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions 
 So if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts 
 And so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking there's a problem 
 And having worked with some of the legal folks very closely uh it becomes a real issue especially when it's smoking 
 and you have to get it fixed el pronto
 As you know they they're allowed to come on site the federaldes anytime they want drive through and see and inspect
 So it's a full time uh everybody has their home phone number type of job Um
 The Sherman facility we are still in the closer too but still have a little bit of um finalization to do 
 Right 
 It's been pitched to the Sherman City Council with um open arms as well as the public 
 We had open forum 
 and and uh uh Tom Jones our environmental corporate environmental guys handle the project
 And uh its real uh going real well 
 I think it's matter just a matter of fund funds right now as I understand it Uh 
 but it's uh it's something else 
 Yeah 
 they're they're they're in the same issue 
 We were hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there 
 Uh because the the system is setup where it won't have any emissions
 You're correct 
 It will have something coming out of the stackhouse it was it was human nature 
 But it won't have can any uh any bad stuff 
 So uh I think T I we spend of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost uh uh first thing we always look at 
 And we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the system of any other firm I know of 
 We eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here
 and uh it's an interesting job 
 But um 
 Possibly
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'm familiar with that one
 We have we have stuff that's very interesting uh 
 we have hoods 
 we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where um they have um that we sample
 and it may have over uh a certain emission levels 
 this is on the solid side 
 and so we take it 
 and uh we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid 
 And we mix it with concrete and actually um potash per se and concrete and then actually put it in the ground But not so not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab
 It was totally legal 
 But the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually show you what duckwork and things 
 And so we were uh very very uh cognizance of and aware of all these types of uh expenditures because it could get very expensive 
 But I think we uh you know we do all kinds of things to make the the world a better place to live you know 
 I think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that 
 I really would 
 Um I've enjoyed speaking with you
 This has been an interesting topic 
 Uh I was one of the 
 I was responsible for all the planning and engineering over the corporate or in the north building 
 Yeah
 So uh I hope you like your office
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Glad to see y'all taken care of 
 Well the uh I think what changed everything and uh is uh y'all were y'all were the only ones that make any money for TI here in the last ten years Ju- 
 Exactly 
 And that's um when when you start when you start paying your way uh you know Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys
 I was just 
 Exactly 
 I've enjoyed speaking with you
 See you later 
 Bye-bye
