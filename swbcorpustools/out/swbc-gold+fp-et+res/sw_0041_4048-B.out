 pretty good 
 pretty good 
 So we're talking about drug testing in the work place huh
 *[[listen]] Yeah 
 we have random drug testing at in my business 
 but I've never been uh never had to do it
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 they started that about a year ago 
 and I think it's mostly for the the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff
 But uh they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time 
 at least that's 
 Pardon
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 they they they'll check for alcohol
 No 
 once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing
 Yeah 
 it's a 
 I'm in the oil business
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I work in the office 
 so uh it's pretty pretty safe environment
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well I I I agree 
 I think that uh you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in in high risk uh uh industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff
 You know 
 if it's 
 as long as it's not abused uh you know random you know 
 as long as it's random and and the individual's rights are uh are protected I don't have that big a problem with it
 Well see this is it 
 this is where I start having my problems with my company 
 I work for a private company 
 and and the policy is something like see if I can re- state this correctly now If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling
 But if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired
 So it you know it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos
 Yeah 
 really 
 it's one of those things that you read once 
 and then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget about it 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 our company's a little tougher on the second chance 
 if if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to you know go out of the way I think a little bit more to uh to help you get help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job
 But uh when you're not when you're a private company the rules don't always apply
 Well it's it's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment 
 and you know it's not 
 I guess I ha- haven't run into anybody that's that's had a problem that's that's been a problem 
 Uh so I gue- you know I guess it works uh much like uh well shoot like any lottery 
 everybody's got an equal chance to get picked
 So uh I'd rather have that than you know say well this week the As and Bs are going to be in 
 and next week Cs and Ds are going to come in 
 Yeah 
 right 
 right
 Yeah 
 Well especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff
 You know I've I've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case 
 Uh I don't remember to tell you the truth 
 I don't think they do 
 Um well they must 
 gee whiz 
 That just shows you how much I've been paying attention 
 because I I really don't know
 I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask 
 Well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far 
 Uh there was a company in Houston that 
 they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company
 oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of 
 it was not only drugs
