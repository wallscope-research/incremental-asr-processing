 Uh I guess my feelings are that uh we almost have a universal health care system uh to a great degree except that now I read where we've left out about thirty-four million people
 And uh I don't know exactly how we're going to cover many of these people because I'm sure that some of them don't uh don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves 
 so uh I I have a feeling since I have just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get that this uh then becomes an obligation of the government 
 because it's going to become an obligation of either state local or federal government anyway
 Well it seems to me that that I'm paying anyway because when I go or my insurance carrier anyway when I pay something the bills seem inordinately high
 And the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that
 It would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who uh employ these people and pay them uh you know subminimum wages or whatever were asked to sh- share their fair burden of this too just as my employer is
 And myself I guess
 Well well who who else is going to do this then
 it's worked successfully in Europe
 I've heard all these stories about 
 I travel extensively and spend uh maybe half a year in Europe every year
 and I find that the health care programs there uh are administered with uh at least people I talk to with uh a great deal of integrity 
 and uh people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree
 As a matter of fact if I'm injured or have an emergency when I'm say in Germany or France uh that I'm automatically taken care of
 I don't even have to pay 
 A- 
 Well I uh uh I know it 
 I have a solution you see 
 M- my solution 
 even though I'm rapidly approaching the uh the age when I'll qualify for Medicare and Medicaid I I 
 my mother and father both uh uh 
 my father's not living but my mother is
 and they are um of an advanced years 
 and when I see the money that's poured down the down the drain on Medicare and Medicaid 
 the absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in 
 and the extraordinary amounts 
 I know that 
 because those people vote 
 they're the ones who get out and vote 
 that's what's robbing a poor mother of the p- prenatal care 
 The young people aren't getting the proper care that they need and nutrition I think
 and we're spending on these useless many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people 
 That's right 
 it does seem like we're th- th- th- 
 now I noticed just the other day in the paper that that Medicare will be based payments will be based not uh just on cost but on cost effectiveness 
 So I gue- 
 Well I don't know uh 
 we'll see how that goes
 I think that was just a regulation that was up for comment 
 but we'll see what happens 
 Well listen uh I think I've I've exhausted my uh self on 
 at least I've blown off steam of the way I feel about it
 Okay
 See you next time 
 Bye
