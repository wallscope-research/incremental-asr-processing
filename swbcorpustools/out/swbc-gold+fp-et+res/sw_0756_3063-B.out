 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's probably a major one 
 I think uh individually uh just by the vast number of people there are there's I think cars are also a major contributor to it
 Yeah 
 vehicles 
 <> Huh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 <> Just a minute I'm on the phone 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well it 
 Yes 
 I have I have five in the kitchen at the moment 
 <> You need to shut the door please 
 Shut the door right now 
 We have the air conditioner running 
 What do you need 
 Hurry 
 I'm on the phone 
 Yes 
 you may 
 And they keep turning the tape recorder up besides 
 Um I have three of my own 
 and I have uh two that I'm tending for the summer Off and on 
 so 
 They cause more noise pollution than air pollution 
 That's right 
 that's right
 Yeah
 But um I think another 
 you can tell when you go around cities you can smell specific things from from specific industries
 I remember being 
 I I grew up in New Jersey
 and uh I can remember the smell of Newark vividly 
 And it's the type of industry you know which obviously if you can smell it it's in the air
 Yeah
 Well people think you burn it it's gone 
 but it's not gone
 Uh-huh
 Then it just gets into the soil and into the water 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 We really have to do more
 I think we've got to do more with the recycling 
 That's 
 I'm I'm really glad to see that there's more of that happening
 Yeah
 Well it's a 
 we're getting 
 at least they're starting you know 
 So at least they're moving that direction
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well 
 it's going to it's probably going to be a generation or two before before it's really going very well because now the adults are more aware of it 
 and the children are being taught in the schools more it'll be you know on down the road this is going to be passed on which is good
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I think you're right 
 education is a big thing you know 
 and as we educate them individually what they can do people become more aware of the things in industry too that that are causing problems 
 and and I think that they'll grad- they'll work towards solving those problems more too Um
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 <> Just a minute and I'll turn it up 
 I'll turn it up in a minute honey when I'm done 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Well I think science has come a long way to making it so that it's possible to find ways to solve the problem 
 Um
 I think they teach it a lot in science 
 Yeah 
 I would think that that's where it would come through
 I I think they're kind of getting it in all different grades
 Yeah
 I think they are starting probably in the first grade 
 They're you know they're hearing somewhat about it 
 Um I know uh Target has their program to make kids more aware of it 
 and 
 Yeah
 They've got if you go in the entrance they've got uh stands usually where they have um little uh kind of a little newspaper thing that the kids can read 
 and and they can form a a group to um 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 So 
 Yeah
 Well I I know it's har- it's a hard problem to solve because you you know like McDonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing
 and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more 
 and then there's the paper and plastic bag question
