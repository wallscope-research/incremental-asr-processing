 Okay 
 Scott let's uh talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university
 and 
 I have some yes some children 
 I have three boys
 And they're all quite young
 and so we want to plan for their education 
 or we're saving right now 
 and we're getting bonds and and uh and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to 
 How about yourself 
 Do you have any kids
 So I imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college your own college 
 Very good
 What uh what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 what you thought huh
 Just the degree itself
 Well that's a that's that's good because I did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work
 I wanted to get a school that was small enough that was personable that you didn't have a lecture uh hall with about fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention
 and uh but you I felt that I got a pretty good uh undergraduate uh 
 I went to Utah State University which is in Logan Utah
 and the nice thing about it too is I knew that I wanted to get into business and that their business College of Business was accredited 
 and well known at least there in the State of Utah and around the surrounding states and so forth 
 And so I I feel like number one you ne- you also need to see what kind of name the 
 like you mentioned before the name the college and university can can give you and another thing that uh another reason why I chose that was the the finances 
 I wanted to make sure that I would be able to afford it that I wouldn't get through four three years of the undergraduate work and and have to leave
 And uh so I did a lot of talking with friends with family with uh counselors at high school and also read some some books on on the subject at the at the library
 And uh it was kind of unusual because my my two older brothers and I all went to thr- three different universities depending on what our choice was 
 So 
 Hopefully we we chose the one that was best for us 
 and I I felt very comfortable and good about that 
 So 
 I don't think so
 I don't know 
 The the way that tuition is increasing um exponentially it's it's it's kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow at the same pace that the college tuition is increasing
 I uh 
 And that that your children can use the benefits of that university 
 Well that's an excellent idea 
 that's an excellent idea 
 One thing that uh that we did uh and my parents and our family is that we weren't able to afford um the kind of education that we all desired 
 So my parents stressed that we get excellent grades so that we apply and try for scholarships
 and uh scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education because my parents couldn't
 And what the scholarship could not supply I was able to to work for and and save and and and get
 Also my my brother um he's a he's a medical doctor right now 
 He had to you know 
 once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree he had to take out some loans 
 and he's he's working to pay those off
 So I I think that the uh you know once you get past uh the initial stages of it that there's different options you can use 
 and and uh the student loans are are good options
 Yeah 
 Yes 
 and and as you're well aware that tuition's not
