 Well uh I don't think that guns should be outlawed
 but it's going to 
 a lot of the stuff that 
 all you do is to get guns and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen Texas not too long ago But I don't really know unless they do uh just outlaw them how you can uh prevent that
 Yeah 
 that 
 well do you even know what the procedures are now
 Um
 But it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it
 Yeah
 Huh I didn't know that 
 Well that's pretty scary 
 So does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten
 That's where I would probably be 
 Well I don't really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better
 because I do think that some people need them and like for protection and stuff
 and I can understand them wanting to have them 
 but then again it's just like all those nuts out there
 It has 
 Because then 
 Um
 Yeah 
 Well is the crime that bad there in Atlanta
 Yeah 
 I know Dallas is 
 I don't know if Dallas is in the top three
 but Do you own a gun
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 That's true
 Yeah
 Well Well now when I first moved to Dallas I moved up here by myself 
 and uh my Dad gave me a gun
 but I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it
 so I finally ended up giving it back to him 
 I said I don't want it 
 I don't want to be responsible for it because you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if I am not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn I don't need it
 Yeah
 And they get it from you
 Uh-huh 
 Set them off
 Yeah 
 well that's why I ended up giving it back to him 
 I thought well you know I don't want it if I don't know how to oper- you know if I don't really know how to use it
 and I just didn't want the responsibility
 So Well uh did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever
 Yeah 
 right 
 That kind of it just makes you wonder how people get guns 
 I would be scared selling guns to people
