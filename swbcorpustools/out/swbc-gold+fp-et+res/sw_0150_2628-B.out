 Well uh the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so 
 Um I think a lot of it has to do with women working
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Ye- yeah 
 Right 
 right 
 And it and it seems if you're going to have kids uh that you are you know society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it
 And uh because if you have you know two well if you go to work you're just working to pay for day care two or three you know um
 Uh-huh 
 Oh that is good 
 Yeah 
 Steve's Steve has a sister who has four 
 She just had her fourth one in uh March 
 and she doesn't have to work either 
 I don't know how they do it 
 I don- I don't know how people do it with one 
 you know um obviousl- 
 yeah 
 obviously we don't have any 
 and and I don't I think that's part of the role reversal is it's okay to get married and not have kids
 And I think for society for such a long time said well you know you're married now you need to sa- have have your family 
 and I don't think it's been until recently that that they had decided that two people was a family
 You know and 
 Right 
 Oh 
 Yea- 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh yeah 
 just the you know the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and stuff
 Oh I know 
 I know
 Gee <> 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 But that's that's probably because you know if you had three you you know would say if I'd of had four 
 I guess it's always not not being able to picture one more 
 but in essence you probably would have worked out fine
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 and and that's all right with me because I don't want to stay home
 you know I think I'm just part of tha- the new stuff that is just 
 I don't know I think I would just go nuts sitting at home all day long
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Right
 That's you did that's what you did Uh
 Yeah 
 I uh I I like the way it is
 It's uh being 
 see we're from Houston and so it's not so hard for people 
 you know you've been married three or so years 
 and you don't have kids well it's okay no- nobody does 
 But you come to a place like Belton 
 and th- 
 a lot of the kids here get married out of high school
 It's real small town 
 and i- 
 and a lot of people in our su- 
 we're the only couple in our Sunday School class except for one other couple who are in their forties 
 and they can't have children who don't have children 
 And they can't imagine why we would want to have children 
 *[[ I think the word might be "wouldn't" otherwise it doesn't make sense ]] And I'm going well you know there's more to life you know there's life in there that's 
 you know not everybody has to have kids 
 and I'd rather spend the time with my husband than you know spending time 
 here it's your turn you know
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I think that's what it is 
 I'm not either
 They're probably going oh I bet she can't get pregnant 
 <> Yeah 
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Steve's mom finally uh finally s- you know said that that God will take care of us when it's our time
 She finally admitted you know she finally told me it's okay if you don't 
 but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very very old fashioned family
 And she stayed home and raised her kids 
 and and she expected all of her kids to do that too 
 and their wives and to be the the housewife and have dinner ready by five and and you know be there at every beck and call 
 and I was raised totally opposite 
 How we got together I don't know 
 but Because my mother had six girls 
 and you know she worked too
 And I guess I just <> 
 and I saw how life was when she stayed home 
 and it was rough 
 it was hard 
 and uh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Yeah 
 I think you've you've earned that though 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 Yeah 
 I think so
 I think it would be neat if if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you
 Uh-huh 
 Are they
 Right
 Yeah 
 I don't know if the T I in Dallas does or not 
 I know I know nobody around here does it 
 we're it's too small around here
 Yeah
