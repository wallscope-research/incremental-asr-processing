 What kind of crime do you think uh is the most prevalent in our society
 Such as New York City 
 Yeah 
 I I I wonder if uh if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because so many people use it 
 and even though just using is not really 
 it is a crime
 Well that's true
 But I was I I was staying in the realm of of felonies versus misdemeanors and uh drug use 
 well actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor 
 but uh what kind what kind 
 have you been uh have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything
 That that's not that much 
 you know those aren't 
 I 
 Yeah 
 I think it is 
 I in some ways it's almost worse than murder
 Uh 
 Murder murder is is hard on the people that were related to 
 you know it is a rather final solution though 
 Yes 
 What what do you think is uh is an appropriate uh punishment for some of the various you know such as things such as rape or or uh murder or something like that
 I agree with that
 Yeah 
 I think Virginia does too up here
 Yeah 
 I think the appeal process takes too long
 I think I I think it should take from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year
 Uh-huh
 Well yeah 
 the system isn't perfect 
 it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans
 You do the best you can to make it perfect you know 
 you you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect
 But I think you have to accept some of the errors 
 I think that murder itself would decrease significantly if if there was a credible punishment uh for murderers
 And society probably too
 just general society to 
 Uh
 Yeah 
 it does 
 and and it decreases the prison population And which is significant
 I mean Yeah
 Yeah 
 generally the crimes of passion and things like that uh are not premeditated
 they can be 
 but usually they aren't
 They're spur of the moment
 and uh the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those those individuals I think that you you end up with a uh uh how do I want to you end up with a s- you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time
 Yes 
 they they would have no problems doing it again
 Uh-huh 
 And I think locking them up for you know fifty years doesn't do a any good because as a as a taxpayer I'm going to pay you know one and a
