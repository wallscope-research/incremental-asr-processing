 Yeah 
 my little girl is three months old 
 and my little boy just turned four 
 I had his birthday party yesterday
 But he's a turtle fanatic 
 He even had turtle cake yesterday 
 But I've been wanting to see TURTLE TWO 
 Is it as good as they say it is
 Good
 GHOST
 Now GHOST 
 yeah 
 I love tearjerker movies 
 But that wasn't too bad on tearjerker 
 but It was it was good movie 
 though I can see why it won so many Oscars 
 *[[slash error--"though" should go with prev utt]] Because that was just so good 
 And I like Demi Moore
 No 
 but I've been hearing a lot about it 
 I don- we don't get to the video store very often 
 and we don't have cable
 Well we don't really want cable 
 it's just you know glued to the T V all the time anyway
 So we get two channels down here 
 I'm from Kentucky originally 
 and we used to get five channels without cable
 You know forty 
 well I don't think you all have the same channels 
 but here in Texas we only get two channels 
 and that's 
 do you watch soap operas
 Okay 
 you work then
 Okay 
 well we get the channel with YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS on it
 And then I think GENERAL HOSPITAL 
 and that comes on different channel
 But that's all we get 
 and that's no cartoons for my little boy 
 But we've got a V C R and a lot of tapes
 And my husband is a movie fanatic
 what about TOTAL RECALL 
 have you seen that
 That's good
 Yeah 
 it was violent 
 I try to get away from that 
 My little boy he loves ROBO COP 
 And that movie I have to I'll fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is 
 have you seen it
 The part where they're shooting mercy 
 That that's horrible 
 that is horrible 
 and their their the language on that's filthy

 It was cute 
 but it wasn't 
 I like the SIXTEEN CANDLES or sixteenth birthday or 
 Yeah 
 that was so good 
 Of course I was a teenager when I seen that 
 and I loved it
 well if you like love stories it's sweet
 it's sweet 
 it really is 
 And that's a tearjerker 
 it gets you 
 I mean it makes you feel really sorry for her
 But it's hilarious too especially with that little guy in it 
 he looks like little I don't know he looks like a little boy next door
 but he's sixteen 
 it's a cute movie 
 I can't remember his name 
 He kind of looks like DOOGIE HOWSER
 Don't know either
 He's got curly blonde hair 
 he just a little freckly little boy
 Yeah 
 if I could remember the name I know you'd know his name because he's played in a few movies 
 But 
 Okay 
 I've heard about that 
 but I can't remember it
 Okay 
 yeah 
 Julia Roberts is good

 What about 
 there was a 
 we got one back here a while 
 I want to see WAR OF THE ROSES too

 well the only reason I know why it ended is on ARSENIO HALL one night Christopher Reeves told that you know 
 I can't believe they killed them
 Or or who was it 
 Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas
 Yeah
 Christopher Reeve wasn't in it at all
 Okay 
 Well Arsenio Hall is the one that jumped up and said that I can't believe they killed them 
 and Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas went after his throat you dummy 
 So I know that they die 
 but I haven't told my husband 
 We've both been wanting to see it
 well we was teasing about you know splitting our house down the middle 
 They did that didn't they 
 and they marked off routes that they could go or something 
 We've got two bathrooms 
 but well i- mi- 
 actually if he takes 
 my house kind of looks like two trailers put together
 And one bathroom is at the end of one side 
 and one's in the middle of the other 
 so we could do it
 No 
 and he could climb out the window 
 Wh- 
 and we our whole house has you know 
 every room leads to three rooms 
 so we can you know 
 yeah 
 you can get around 
 You just can't go out the front door honey

 I think he's up in a attic or some part of school 
 He got locked in the school 
 and he got scared 
 but he starts dreaming 
 and then he's saving the land of 
 it's been so long since I've seen it
 All I know all's I can really remember is him flying this great big dog this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing
