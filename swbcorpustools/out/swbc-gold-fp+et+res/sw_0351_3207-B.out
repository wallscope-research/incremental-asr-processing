 actually I have I've I've been in them but just visiting 
 and we used to g- when we were like in in our teen ages 
 we'd go on Sundays and visit you know the older people 
 But I have an elderly grandma that lives with us
 And she's lived with us for like five years 
 So I kind of know how it is to how to decide if you want to put somebody in a rest home 
 or like we I mean we've had those discussions you know about should we put her in or because she's pretty senile 
 and 
 Yeah
 It's rea- 
 Uh-huh
 really
 Uh-huh
 Right
 To put her in a rest home
 well see it's more my grandma that feels that way
 She says that when her husband died that he said that my uncle had said that he would never ha- put her in a rest home 
 So it's kind of 
 I don't know 
 I mean I don't I don't think my parents would 
 but she is getting pretty bad 
 like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed 
 and it's 
 and my mom has to take care of her pretty much 
 so it gets 
 I don't know 
 It's it's a hard decision 
 but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally 
 When he retired
 Yeah 
 it's like that good for us just because my uncle and my and my mom switch off like we have her for three months 
 and then he has her for three months
 So that that works out good
 Uh-huh
 Really
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 You think 
 I I I'm not really familiar with how other countries
 They're seen as senile 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 I know
 I'm twenty
 Yeah 
 it's it really is 
 but and she she drives us craz-
