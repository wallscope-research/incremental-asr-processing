 <> Yes 
 I think we're terribly taxed 
 I I think the Republicans have taxed us just as much as the Democrats 
 and I don't think there's a change between one party than the other 
 I think we get a lot back 
 but not as much as we should
 Right 
 The Gramm the Gramm Rudman Act 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 well I think they spend too much 
 They they spend too much on themselves too 
 the the A lot of the the taxes gets back to the members of the Congress and everything all running for twenty years rather than 
 No 
 you're right
 Yeah 
 no 
 I think it is the Congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money 
 The national debt is terrible 
 
 Right 
 yeah 
 I saw one on TWENTY TWENTY about a month ago I guess whereas one I think that he was a Senator from Pennsylvania or something like that 
 Maybe it was Connecticut 
 I'm not sure 
 one of the small states up there where he had a bill through for another a drug agency that would be located there 
 and he was the only one that wanted it 
 Was going to cost millions of dollars 
 The drug agency didn't want it 
 and he was going to build it in his home town 
 and they were going to hire a lot of people
 and it was ridiculous you know the whole thing 
 And and you know they asked him about it 
 Do you really need this 
 This is going to cost a lot of money 
 yes 
 we need it 
 But do you know that the drug agency doesn't want this
 And they do things that are you know just like the 
 Yeah 
 that 
 Right 
 Right
 They're supposed to do what we say 
 but they do what they they want to do with it 
 Absolutely 
 absolutely 
 We need to get that through 
 We we have said that I've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two yea- two terms is enough for all of them
 whether you're mayor all the way up city council the works I think Certainly President that two terms is plenty
 And then we get these professionals out of there 
 and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves you know rather than living off of us
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Well it's so much money 
 and you can't even add it up you know
 that's why they think 
 Yeah 
 when you talk about the trillions of dollars on this and that 
 Our national debt in the trillions of dollars you know
 Foreign aid 
 yeah
 Foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless it's absolutely necessary 
 They they've given that away for fifty years 
 I agree 
 I agree
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 I I know we're taxed to death on every every thing 
 I don't know what's the best way to do it 
 but they don't even talk about that 
 They just raise it 
 They don't even consider it like you saying to cut something back you know
 They are at least doing something now with the the military you know 
 they're cutting some of that 
 but of course now you know T I 
 you know that's hurting us but although 
 But T I has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else 
 And if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic weapon systems 
 But that's the only good that I've seen Congress do you know and everybody and all the Congressmen and the President and everybody 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 The only taxes I think that are well spent 
 well not the only but 
 I think the now I I don't understand the present school thing 
 but I have two daughters 
 one's in college already 
 and one's about to be in high school 
 But I think that paying for school schools is the schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime 
 And so I don't mind paying for school taxes even though my kids will be out of it you know
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 The spending is out of control 
 Yeah 
 I agree with you
 I I think that's a wide open subject what you said 
 People need to take a stand 
 I think the people will here shortly 
 I think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out too that what they did last election 
 and ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in you know 
 so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes you know 
 They're supposed to represent us 
 That's what they're called
 but they don't
 May may may maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there guys and gals whatever they are
 I know 
 but it 
 No 
 that's right 
 you don't want to
 you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be 
 Right
 Yeah 
 that's you're right 
 Well I think one of the good ones in the metroplex in the last say twenty-five years or so maybe longer they've built all these dams 
 You know the Corps of Engineers have soon as they finish a lake they'll go at get another one 
 And that we haven't had we've had droughts here in long summers
 we've had good water supply 
 and that's due to the Corps of Engineers building looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us you know 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I think anything for water supply like that 
 California should do more of that too
 Right
 Right 
 They just finished Joe Poole Lake over here 
 and they need to start another one 
 I think every time they finish one they ought to just have another one in line 
 The water's critical 
 Right
 Okay 
 yeah 
 How many calls have you made
 yeah 
 I'm up to twenty 
 Are you a T Ier
 well great 
 great 
 okay
 Well it's been some interesting subjects 
 yeah
 Thanks for calling
 Bye-bye
