 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 no 
 How much was the alternator
 Did he did he hook up the wir- wiring wrong
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 they probably built that in so they could make money
 Well I had a weird 
 there's a little sensing device in front of my <> I'm not sure right in front of the f- fan 
 it's a it's an air conditioner sensing device 
 I don't know why 
 it actually 
 there's a metal piece that fits through the belts 
 and somehow that broke off 
 and I I still can't figure out how it broke 
 and anyway so a- this piece obviously 
 I have a Subaru 
 and I think you can only get it through Subaru dealer etcetera 
 so 
 this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks 
 And and I haven't had too many problems with my car 
 I got a eighty-eight Subaru G L X T 
 and it 
 and then you know just basic maintenance and oil changes 
 an I and I do not do my oil changes 
 and I will not do my oil changes 
 I've I think the first time I tried to do one and ended up trying to ge- 
 yo- borrowed somebody else's jack 
 and I did this 
 and I went and bought everything
 so after buying the filter and all the oil you're looking at ten bucks at least or somewhere in there an and and then to go to the trouble that I figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube
 So that that's you know 
 as far as any maintenance on my car I I shy away from the oil changes 
 that's for sure
 How did you put that many miles on it in four or five years
 a hundred and forty mile trip
 thirty-five miles each way
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Do you work for T I
 Okay
 I was going to ask you you know as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now 
 I don't work for T I 
 and I'm just I get these green 
 I don't know what you want to call them fake <> point things
 and I just wondering how I go about getting the cash 
 okay
 Okay
 Okay 
 all right 
 well that's good to know 
 I haven't been doing 
 th- this is the first time I've been called in a long time 
 and I haven't been doing it 
 so 
 And I've done it maybe twelve times
 Well I don't know if I've done it quite that much 
 but mine is mixed up too 
 I have to call and get it fixed 
 Uh-huh
 well
 I was driving a sixty-six Plymouth Fury
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 and tha- that's when they made cars though 
 this things was the body was in good condition 
 and you know it ran fine 
 It was starting to burn some oil
 And but I had to <> you know ge- 
 you know I after about thr- couple of months after I was out of college I finally splurged and bought my car 
 so 
 Yeah 
 well you know these these cars made in the sixties and stuff 
 I mean the steel I mean the thickness 
 I mean i- those thin- they're just th- 
 you just don't see cars like that
 And they last a long time 
 And they were simple too 
 the engines were simple and durable 
 and some people will still buy them you know 
 they'll 
 It almost costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it 
 you're just better off buying another car
