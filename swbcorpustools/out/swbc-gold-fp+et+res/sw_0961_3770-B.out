 Yes 
 I have 
 In fact just a little over just a little less than a year ago my mother went to be with the Lord 
 and we cared for her the last seventeen months of her life here in the at home Aside from having to take her to the hospital 
 and you know those times well she was there in the the regular hospital
 And then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer 
 and so the doctor elected to have her finish out in the hospice program
 And I as far as I'm concerned that is far and above any nursing home because she's around her own fa- you know the the elderly parent in question is around their own family 
 The hospice program provides a hospital type bed Well it is a hospital bed and all the oxygen stuff and a and a visiting nurse at least every other day et cetera et cetera et cetera
 And it's all taken care of by by Medicare 
 and it it's it's really neat {F uh 
 } And I you know I wouldn't I wouldn't banish my old loved one to a to a warehouse
 And that's that's what I basically view a nursing home as a warehouse 
 so that's

 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Yeah 
 I know 
 But in this case spouse and I are we're are are united in this area because I guess her father her grandfather and grandmother both lived with her parents th- th- their golden years too 
 so this isn't like just one one instance 
 In fact her experiences were were invaluable to me 
 in fact I don't know if I could have held up you know without my wife helping in this this in this case
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 okay
 Uh-huh
 Well maybe well as as you say the care of of grandmother or was was just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it
 boy 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well then then there's almost then there's almost no no choice left to her then 
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 In fact just just sit and chat with them for five minutes and and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 And then then 
 yeah 
 it did 
 and I was just pr- I just praised the Lord that that we were able to have
