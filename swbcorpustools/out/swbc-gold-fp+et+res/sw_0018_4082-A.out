 I get most of my news from newspapers really 
 I read the daily newspaper the HOUSTON CHRONICLE 
 and sometimes I'll read like the WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES 
 I don't subscribe to either 
 but sometimes I get a hold of copies of it 
 how about you 
 Do you mostly get things from T V or 
 Oh
 that's interesting 
 You said computer networks 
 what what sort 
 I am fairly knowledgeable of <> 
 okay 
 That's interesting
 Oh 
 I- 
 is it is it the A P news wire 
 or is it something that is a little bit different from that
 okay 
 So that's that's interesting 
 Okay 
 Yeah 
 I've had I had access in the past to the A P news wire 
 and I thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news 
 I've never used the DOW JONES news wire 
 but 
 yeah 
 it 
 do you get any do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach
 Yeah 
 In what way 
 In like in sort of like qual- quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever
 Yeah 
 Well you won't offend me 
 So go ahead and say 
 Yeah 
 Like a liberal type of bias
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 They they generally make mistake on anything technical at least <>
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Do you by mistakes do you mean just like honest mistakes 
 or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 
 That's disturbing
 I haven't really noticed them doing that 
 but whatever 
 again I don't watch T V news that much now 
 If I had access to C N N I would watch T V news more 
 I don't you know but I don't usually
 Yeah 
 Did you did you think that C N N well the Gulf War coverage would be kind of an abnormality 
 I just wonde- I guess 
 I would be curious to know what you thought as to how like say C N N T V news compared to the three networks 
 you know whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever 
 but I I guess you wouldn't 
 You probably 
 if you just watched it during the Gulf War that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much
 Yeah
 Yeah
