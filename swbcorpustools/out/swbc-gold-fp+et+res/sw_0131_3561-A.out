 short term I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it
 the short term the recession is getting getting top attention
 And that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not
 And that's got to be paid
 It can only hurt the deficit picture
 and the the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without bringing on on serious problems for the longer term
 So that that that's the current predicament
 Yeah 
 I'm not sure how I feel about paying on the quest the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point 
 It's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is
 Well well first of all you look to the Fed to fight the recession as indeed it has with interest rates
 Well at the moment we're doing very well on inflation
 That's the sort of upside to the deficit
 That's the upside to the recession
 Well can be done or will be done are two different things 
 at various places to look for for cutting the budget first of all I consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation 
 But there are various other areas such as as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed 
 a lot of entitlement programs like education aid I think they should put a in 
 the Reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class 
 in the longer term we we we'd do well I think to make to make reductions there 
 Also somewhat is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed
 A lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools which are sort of not colleges 
 but schools that teach you trades you know beautician well and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition and the school gets paid off immediately 
 and then they don't provide very much education
 Yes
 Yeah
