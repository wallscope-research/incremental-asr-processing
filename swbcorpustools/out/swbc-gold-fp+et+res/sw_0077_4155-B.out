 Taxes
 Do we pay too much
 Well do we
 
 My tax bracket is is pretty high up there 
 I pay the I generally pay the maximum tax bracket
 And I think that we're paying too much 
 because I don't have any children
 And I pay a lot of property taxes
 I don't have any I don't you know I don't use an awful lot of city services 
 It it you know it's like I have to work m- I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes
 And y- there's so many people who want a a dib of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is 
 and I just 
 sometimes many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes
 How about you 
 Do you pay too much
 Well when you when you go out into the when you go out into the working world it it changes quickly
 you look at your paycheck 
 and you go my gosh where did it all go 
 what kind of what kind of 
 well have you pay a lot of in ta- 
 have you been out working and then gone back to school 
 or are you did you go directly from high school into into college
 To worry about it 
 Have you have you been active in in politics trying to concerning this 
 Have you like worked on political action committees or something like that
 I I haven't done any of that type of work myself
 but every once in a while when I hear up here at at in D C area one of the radio stations has been talking about the the Congress 
 Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there you know 
 there's a bank that they all bank with 
 and I guess it went defunct recently
 And one of the Congressmen has has written in the last three years al- about a thousand bad checks
 And we we the taxpayers float him a loan for all tho- all those bad checks no interest no repayment schedule
 And it's causing quite a stir up here because we're so close to D C anyway
 It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur
 I I I think we pay too much 
 And I've I look at my paycheck 
 and I make 
 well let's see 
 They take out in state and federal taxes 
 I think I pay forty-two percent
 Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government
 and then they charge me sales tax 
 and they charge me gasoline taxes
 and they charge me all these others 
 and it's just too expensive
 I can't believe that 
 I I'm just thankful that I don't get all the government that I pay for
 You know what I mean
 Do you have you used student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government
 What are you studying down there
 Physics
 that sounds like a fun fun field
 Scientific
 Heavy science
 Are you like in the particle particle research or anything like that 
 or is it more applied physics
 Okay
 Well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's come rolling towards whatever it's rolling toward
 Actually I don't think we are
 like like Europe England I know the taxes are a lot higher
 But they do have socialized medicine and things like that
 And I know I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that they're talking 
 or maybe it was on the radi-
