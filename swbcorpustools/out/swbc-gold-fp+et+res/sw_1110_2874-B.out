 So you like to fish 
 Yeah 
 actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me 
 We actu- we have the those little the the the Great Lakes you know 
 Grea- 
 Lake Ontario is right near here
 Plus we're in what's called the Finger Lake Region of New York 
 where there're lots of small lakes everywhere 
 and these are real good for like you know bass fishing and so forth
 No 
 we have a qui- actually quite a lot of variety 
 There's there's 
 we have large mouth small mouth sort of musky pike stuff like that
 You know all sorts of fun stuff like that 
 we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on Lake Ontario every year
 So it's it's that's a lot of fun
 How about you 
 Do you like what do you like to go for
 Yeah
 
 We have some friends who live on the lake
 and it the lake it just seems is is completely filled with bass to the point where you know normally you [ go + [ y- + [ y- go ] ] ] fishing for bass you get a lot of sunfish or or cat or whatever and some other strange stuff 
 *[[listen]] But in this particular lake we went out with some friends once 
 and we just every time you tossed the line in you pull up a five six seven inch minimum bass 
 and usually you pull up you know thirteen to fourteen inch bass
 Yeah 
 it's a real it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just we pull up you know bass after bass 
 and *[[slash error]] During perch season as well you pull up a lot of 
 *[[slash error]] probably during during perch season the perch will run in very large schools 
 so what they'll do is j- 
 you'll you'll be sort of boating around 
 these people own a little row boat 
 and they'll be boating around 
 and they'll hit a they'll hit a school of perches in the middle
 and when they do you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at 
 they they just drop it in 
 They can't pull it in fast enough
 I they actually they 
 according to them you can catch when the perch are running you can catch them on just about anything
 They tend to use I guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes 
 but you know I've 
 she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything you know
 They'll 
 corn or salami or bread or anything 
 they'll they'll they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded these large schools
 Yeah 
 it's a big problem
 Yeah
 
 Wow
 A big one
 that's that's that's a nice size carp
 Uh-huh
 That that that counts 
 Do you do you do you actually like the taste of f- 
 do you like eat the fish that you catch 
 or are you more of a sport fisherman
 Right 
 so you can just 
 because I don't actually like fish 
 It's sort of 
 so when I fish it's more for sport than anything else
 Right
 And and and and and be careful you don't get stung
 Yeah 
 I know it 
 Have you ever tried deep sea fishing
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we I was out in Florida with a friend a while ago 
 and we would go and just drop two you know a a two or three rig two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat 
 We just dropped it down there 
 and the captain had you know some kind of sonar in the boat
 so he'd maneuver us into a school of fish 
 and you just drop it in and and it just 
 you you get one or two at a shot you know 
 and It's a good deal too 
 It was it was a like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat
 You know and and and they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want
 Well this is 
 yeah 
 this this this was for a you know large 
 there were maybe thirty of us on the boat 
 We we weren't all related just you know thirty people off the shop in the boat there
 If you want to go on a boat alone it's like two hundred dollars a day
 But this is great because it was I think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something
 You know 
 so you'd get to go out there for five- for for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and and fish all day 
 It's really nice <> 
 It's real enjoyable
 I think we're probably close though
 Nice talking to you too 
 Good luck with fishing this season
 Bye-bye
