 Okay 
 what kind of car are you going to buy next
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's true 
 that's true
 Well I'm really not looking at anything for a while 
 but you know when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out 
 and you think well maybe maybe I would like a new car
 But I think I'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway
 But 
 Right 
 they are
 I sure do like the looks of that new Mit- Mitsubishi Diamante
 That is a pretty car
 Uh-huh 
 that's pretty too
 Yeah 
 they get pretty expensive
 The last one I bought I bought a 
 well it's a it's a Town Car 
 but it was a demo returned
 and I got it with like you know I think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars of- less than what the list price was
 So I was really pleased to find that 
 and I then I bought it for cheaper 
 I was looking at a Honda Accord a brand new one
 and I bought this the the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what I was going to buy the new Honda Accord
 And the thing about it is they give you that ten that hundred thousand mi- mile five year warranty where it only costs you twenty-five dollars to have anything repaired
 So I have really been impressed 
 I said I probably never be able to find another one that I can afford you know
 But I have loved this car better than anything I've ever driven because you can go on the road and get there 
 and you're not even tired
 And it gets like twenty-six miles to the gallon on the road
 It sure does
 I they kept telling me that 
 and I thought they're crazy
 so the week after I got it well actually before I signed the papers on it I took it over to Boozier City
 and it did it
 But it's 
 Yeah 
 Well that's kind of what we've always been told you know they'll do 
 and then we hope for it 
 and it never happens
 but it really it does get good gas mileage
 Most of the time when I don't go anywhere I can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work you know and then fill it up 
 so 
 I haven't had anything
 I've taken it in twice for like just really minor things 
 and it cost me the twenty-five dollars 
 The really something really silly when we first got it 
 we couldn't get the light 
 they have all these lights in the car
 and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat
 and we couldn't get the light to turn off
 And we kept trying you know 
 and we went out to dinner with some friends 
 and it stayed on all night you know just shining right down on them you know
 and we couldn't get it to turn off 
 and the next day my husband goes out there 
 and he tries to get it off 
 we turn the knob you know in the front that's supposed to turn the lights on and off 
 and we turned everything we could 
 and he took it in 
 and they said you know you just have to press the switch 
 He says I've pressed every switch in that car 
 and I can't get the light off
 it's broken
 So they took it in and charged us the twenty-five dollars 
 and they called and told us though that all you have to do is turn the off switch 
 and they showed us where the switch was
 They they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch
 But he hadn't he hadn't done the right one
 And it's right on the arm rest in the back
 and we didn't know it was there
 And the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car
 and so we thought you know there there was it was broken
 But we've had just 
 I guess it's been in two times 
 I've had it three years now
 And it's been in two maybe three times 
 But it's just been real minor things
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 But it's really it's been an enjoyable car 
 Like I say I'll probably never be able to have another one because I think we bought it for about sixteen thousand you know
 and I said I'll never find another one for that price
 And they keep going up 
 so I'll have to enjoy it
