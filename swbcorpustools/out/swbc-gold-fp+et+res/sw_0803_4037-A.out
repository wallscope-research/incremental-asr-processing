 I I'm not familiar 
 I think you guys in Indiana don't you have the the death penalty
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I I tend to agree with you 
 I've changed my views over e- even within the last few years to be honest 
 when I was in coll- when I was an undergraduate I was a member of Amnesty International
 and and of course at that time you know I thought it was stupid to kill anybody for 
 you know that 
 the eye for an eye was a stupid argument
 But the the more 
 now I live in downtown Dallas 
 and I you know I've seen I've seen cases on in the news and all where where you know a a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder/
 I think that maybe a good solution to capital punishment might be reserve it solely for repeat offenders of a crime like murder
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 it seems sensible and failsafe 
 I I I don't 
 you know not completely failsafe 
 but if a man's convicted of two murders you know there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong
 I also 
 to tell you how liberal I have turned toward this or or or whatever side that is I've kind of chosen I believe it that big time drug importers like say Noriega for example that these people need to be eliminated from society 
 and I think I think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because really any kind of jail sentence for them is just another chance to create another power structure 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well do you 
 are there cases where you think that that the capital the capital punishment shouldn't be sentenced
 Uh-huh
 Right
 That's true 
 yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Sure 
 yeah 
 I understand I understand your point 
 Yeah 
 of course you know with with with Dahlmer now you you realize that Ohi- I think it's Ohio gets to try him next 
 and they do have the death penalty
 Yeah 
 so that was a curious case 
 I 
 something is sort of nightmarish to say the least
 well here in Texas we 
 I think even even this last week last week they had another they 
 you know they use their capital punishment by lethal injection
