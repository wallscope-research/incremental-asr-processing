 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 That's very spicy too
 I mean these bell peppers and curry
 that sounds really good
 Huh 
 I guess it was 
 is this dinner time for you
 All done in advance 
 yeah 
 That's I I'm I'm not that great a cook 
 but I was single until I was thirty 
 so I did cook a little you know
 and I cook a little bit now 
 What I like to do mostly is stir fries 
 and my wife normally says Tom why why don't you make a stir fry tonight 
 and so we even we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok
 And we do a lot of stir fry vegetables
 It's it's called a stir fry pan 
 and it and it fits right on your st- it fits right on your burner whether it's gas or electric 
 so it's it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does
 And normally what happ- what we do is just you know like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular oi- vegetable oil 
 But I will use peanut peanut oil or things 
 And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and green peppers and maybe put in a little bit of garlic and ginger beforehand 
 That gives spicier flavor 
 and then after the stir fry is over just mix in a little bit of sometimes chicken broth and corn starch and soy sauce 
 and that sort of makes a a glaze that sticks to the the vegetables 
 I've used 
 you turn them over 
 A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu 
 we don't put in meat cause I guess we're I'm not 
 but she likes to watch all the how much red meat and things 
 so We'll do a lot of times vegetarian
 But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and carrots and celery and green peppers and gee mushrooms
 It's it's a pretty big 
 and we put that over rice
 you don't 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 see we never in fact I never had squash growing up 
 My my wife eats more vegetables ate more vegetable than I did growing up/
 I'm I'm from Pittsburgh 
 and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town
 Yeah 
 recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato
 Red meat and a potato
 she had all of those types of vegetables
 See never no vegetables in my family 
 Yeah 
 it was really funny
 Well that was a real farm
 No 
 but I I've I've heard stories 
 I've heard stories
 
 this is ter- 
 you shouldn't be talking about this right before while you're fixing dinner
 That's right 
 you should be careful 
 That's pretty funny
 But my dad used to tell stories you know about the way they eat chickens 
 but I never we never we lived in the suburbs 
 we we bought everything in a grocery store
 There was no 
 but it was funny you know 
 it so 
 but when we got married you know a lot more vegetables a lot more you know a lot of changes
 I think so too
 but we just went shopping 
 and we came back with with sweets you know chocolate covered peanuts 
 and we came back with sweets 
 We didn't bring all the healthy food back too
 Uh-huh 
 well that's that's supposed to be the trend of the future but the cut back 
 I recently was over a friends house that's Indian 
 and she had brought Indian sweets into the office 
 and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots
 Yeah 
 that was a sweet 
 and I was like ugh
 This is a sweet 
 it is it's a candy 
 I'm like ugh you know 
 Indian candy is not very good
 But everything was and everything 
 you didn't notice it at first 
 but everything was sort of hot 
 Everything had a little bit of curry in it
 It was funny even the sweets did
 When you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it 
 but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it 
 You know it had that that after taste that very it was a very Indian flavor
 Good 
 they didn't have 
 I didn't like her desserts very well 
 they were very yogurt and carrots and pin- pistachios pistachio nuts and yogurt
 And it wasn't very good
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 well have we done our ten minutes
 Something like that 
 I think we're 
 No 
 nor- normally they just come in 
 and they say you've overextended your your conversation
 okay 
 well that's 
 you'll see it will normally it will come on 
 and it'll say you've over extended your conversation you now have fifteen minutes to compl- fifteen seconds to complete it
 But I've been cut off twice
 So I just thought 
 in fact I'm just also 
 I'm hearing a siren outside I think my my neighbors car must have got bumped you know 
 he has one of those alarms on his car
 one of the the neighbor has an alarm on a car 
 and it's going off
 So I was going to go out and see what they were doing
 Okay 
 hey thanks so much
 Uh-huh 
 and you said this was your fi- 
 well you'll you'll get a couple more probably
 I I called yesterday I or Friday 
 maybe I talked to somebody that I got them on during the day 
 It was a housewife 
 and she was home with two kids
 And while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background you know that they wanted something 
 and they were arguing back and forth 
 and she just kept talking the whole time 
 it was pretty funny
 Okay
 Hey thanks a lot 
 I'll talk to you later
 Bye
