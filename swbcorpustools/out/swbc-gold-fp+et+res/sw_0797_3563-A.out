 Okay 
 Lucille I'm on on 
 And our top- okay our topic was 
 did you hear our topic
 All right 
 basketball
 I guess I'm probably a lot like you 
 I'm a Dallas Maverick fan
 Well unfortunately I don't expect a great deal out of them 
 They just have too many problems too many ailments too many hurt bones and maybe too much age at this point 
 You know when Roy Tarpley just now he messed up on them it just hurt them so bad 
 I feel like everyone else 
 I feel sorry for Donald Carter and the members of the team and the management team and everyone else 
 It just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final a final team playing for all of it
 National championship or the world championship and something like this happens
 Yeah 
 I think at this time we're just in a a rebuilding type of phase you know 
 I think that probably be evident with the more and more the more and more young guys they draft 
 But 
 gosh 
 I'm so much a Maverick Maverick fan I don't know 
 Probably the Boston Celtics 
 I've just always like the Boston Celtics 
 They have a they have a similar situation in that a lot of old guys on the team 
 and but they're still playing good ball
 But I'm I've always been a Boston Celtic fan too 
 but you know I've lived in Texas since seventy-four 
 so being a transplanted Texan in in the Dallas area I have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks
 Yes 
 we do You know
 Yes 
 I go to a few games 
 I haven't been to many 
 I'm not a season ticket holder or anything 
 I was a season ticket holder of the Cowboys for years 
 and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing sort of gets boring going by yourself 
 you bet
 Well I don't know 
 It seems like Rolando Blackman and and Harper sort of carry the team 
 they just 
 I don't know 
 I'm afraid to say that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good 
 but and that can really help the team 
 but they do that 
 they trade the nucleus of their power right now
 Well you know I feel like the best they can hope for this year is probably an opportunity to make the playoffs 
 I like their coach 
 I really like a lot 
 and I just I think he deserves a good break 
 I think he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club 
 I think Donald Carter the owner I think with all he's invested he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also
 This thing with Roy Tarpley just upset everyone I think Fans owners management everyone
 You bet 
 I think they're fools if they ever bring him back 
 Hate to put it that way 
 I just would not believe him any more
 No
 There's an old saying you can you can lead a horse to water 
 but you can't make him drink 
 So 
 And I think Tarpley's just a sad case
 But to be making a a million dollars a year that's pretty sad
 I think you're right 
 Everything has been put out of perspective now 
 You know you take a a young kid Roy Tarpley's age I'd say he was twenty-one when he came into the league 
 and now he's probably an old age of twenty-five or six and making all that money 
 well that's that's quite a that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they they need at that point in their life I think
 I think you know it's created by
