 Cooking and food 
 What do you like to cook
 Uh-huh
 dear
 probably not 
 I have a bread recipe that is real easy that everyone always really does like That doesn't require kneading the dough
 And it is always it is wonderful 
 It is 
 and what is funny is that you use bran all bran
 and it looks like it is a wheat bread
 But it is actually all bran flour
 and you know it is just regular 
 the type that you know yeast and that sort of thing 
 and you let it rise 
 and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and then punch it down and then make your rolls 
 They really are good
 and they are so easy to do
 That is 
 seems like every time that we have a dinner party or that we are going some place where everybody is suppose to bring something and they have had my rolls before They always ask me to bring those rolls <>
 No 
 I haven't
 how funny
 Well see I I have always used celery I mean I have used celery before 
 But I never used the celery seed in it
 Well what else do you put in it besides the celery seed
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 See I have never put bell pepper in tuna fish either
 Isn't that funny
 I was brought up with tuna fish you know where you put in chopped hard boiled eggs which is now is a no no with cholesterol and you know chopped up dill pickles And that sort of thing 
 The standard old tuna fish
 Uh-huh
 But isn't that interesting 
 So you You you use bell pepper and onion and celery seed 
 I will have to try that
 Sometimes I do 
 and sometimes I use the Miracle Whip 
 It depends on what I have
 And sometimes if I am using like regular mayonnaise to spice it up a little bit I will use a little bit of mustard with it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 But not a bunch
 But enough to make it have a little bit more flavor
 I like to barbecue baby back ribs
 And and and they are so easy to do if you have a good barbecue sauce
 and you just cook them very very slowly in the oven
 And it is not hard to cook like some meals are
 And it is not of course it is messy to eat 
 That is the disadvantage
 And I make lasagna from scratch 
 and people really like my lasagna
 and so sometimes I am requested to make that 
 And that is not too hard to do because you can do it in advanced and just bake it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Then I have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie 
 It just takes forever
 But it is when the strawberries are nice and big and fresh and yummy 
 uh-huh 
 I do 
 But this one is basically it is like a normal pie crust
 But then you use this sort of 
 it is a cream cheese layering 
 but you use thin it out a little bit or make it a little fluffier 
 and you put line the whole pie crust with that
 and so it is sort of like in a way using cheese cake 
 but and it is not a real cheese cake 
 and then you
