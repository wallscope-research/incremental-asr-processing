 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 wel- th- I guess I haven't had that much experience 
 I've only seen like my great grandparents in a nursing home
 but I have an aunt who lived on her own until she was well in her nineties
 and then she she got sick 
 and she ended up in nursing home
 and my parents went to visit her 
 and it got to the point where the nur- it seemed like the nursing home didn't want to deal wi- her anymore
 and so they gave her drugs to keep her asleep 
 Nice sedative state
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 To be violent 
 Was this in a big town or a little town
 really
 Because it seems like the small town nursing homes there's a lot more personal attention
 Uh-huh 
 You have more options
 Uh-huh
