 yes 
 I have two boys who are twenty-eight and twenty-four and a daughter who is twelve
 Yes 
 Same husband everything
 but 
 Uh-huh
 If it's not raining
 Are are you down here in Texas
 
 Okay 
 yeah
 You know what I meant with rain 
 Oh
 Okay 
 what 
 Yeah 
 I I have 
 can you hold on just a sec-
 I have to answer a business phone 
 I hate to do it on this call
 Good morning A R E this is Arlene Lister <> 
 It was just a recorded message on our business phone anyway 
 I'm sorry 
 keep going
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well there there was not nearly as much of it 
 In fact I I think things were were quite a bit different
 when my my big kids were were little you know ev- ev- all the mothers were home
 You know the the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around 
 and then when they felt like it they went out to play you know when they were were little like that
 And I I think it's gotten very different 
 When my second one was little they were coming out with SESAME STREET which he started watching 
 and other than that I mean there was basically there was not educational T V
 or you know you got some cartoons 
 and that was it 
 but they they were never that interested in it anyway 
 They'd rather I mean they'd take their trucks out in the backyard you know go out and play and stuff 
 But we always did just you know to the park for walks and to the zoo and museum 
 We did a lot of stuff like that with with our kids 
 And course when they got bigger they were both quite into sports 
 and and you know so whatever you know they would do we'd go along with
 and a girl is very different 
 We have 
 a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping 
 So they're very very different 
 but y- 
 kind of the same thing our you know 
 she now 
 lot of time spent with her 
 she's so busy 
 is you know going to you know 
 like last night was a band concert
 and she plays on her school volleyball team and stuff like that 
 But we we still like to pack up you know just go someplace for the day or you know just stuff like that 
 One of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at College Station
 so that's 
 we go down there fairly often you know for a weekend for you know family get-togethers and stuff like that
 
 Uh-huh
 yes
 Yeah 
 I I think our kids just always dearly loved that you know play bounce the ball or just 
 course when our big ones were little we lived up north you know
 and this time of the year it it the fun thing was to go out and swoosh around in the leaves you know
 So You know so it's it's very different 
 and and you know we also come winter time we'd stick them on sleds 
 And we had a pond across the street 
 and and from little on you know 
 I'm 
 it's it's so different down here where y- you go take lessons to learn to ice skate or something
 You know when our kids were little you you got them a pair of skates
