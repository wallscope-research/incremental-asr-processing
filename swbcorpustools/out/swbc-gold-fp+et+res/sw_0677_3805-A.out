 go ahead 
 tell me what you think 
 Do we get our money's worth
 Yeah 
 did you see SIXTY MINUTES last night
 Well they did a thing on the thirty-five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need 
 And it's staggering
 Well there are a lot of things that people I think general 
 Well I think it's interesting to look at where the money goes 
 and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go 
 and and I don't think generally I think what's interesting is that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government 
 and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with
 And that what I think is going to be really interesting is what we do about it 
 I mean we are going to have to change the people who represent us
 I mean and I think it's going to be real interesting to see and and then force upon them 
 Yeah 
 right that's y- I think that's the only thing that's going to change it
 Our anger is going to have to to give rise to to more activity on our part 
 I've I've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active 
 and in our society there's very little full employment 
 Most people in this country are getting worse off not better off
 Eighty percent of the public according to Bill Moyers' 
 recent 
 piece for 
 Public Broadcasting which by the way is a very good use of government money I think P B S is wonderful 
 But this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes 
 and thus standards of living decline 
 And twenty percent are seeing theirs improve 
 That's not a formula for a better society
 And the government really plays a role in this
 I mean they are the people whose strings are pulled and by I guess powerful intere- 
 You know and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of of the voter revolting 
 But people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't 
 and they think it's unfair 
 and when they recognize that it's their tax money they're going to do more about it 
 I th- I'll tell you one quick one thing very interesting 
 C B S after the State of the Union address is going to open up a telephone line an eight hundred number 
 and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country
 They expect opening it for one hour that they'll get three hundred thousand telephone calls
 And I've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to p- create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government Like one eight hundred capitol or something like that You know y- just a number you could call from anywhere anytime 
 I think that's coming 
 and I think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change 
 Until then I think you know it's going to be really painful 
 So the question is how soon are we going to start to get our money's worth 
 and as you said it's how soon we get involved 
 and I think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look do it this way not that way or I like this or I don't like that or this is how I feel about your spending my money on art that I don't think is art
 Well that's the good thing about what is happening because I think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it is telling us you know about the problems 
 So the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country
 Over a very long period of time
 and 
 Right
 Yeah
 Well you may be right 
 What I think is really going to be interesting is to see how we as a society deal with it 
 and I and I think it is what you say it's it's a
