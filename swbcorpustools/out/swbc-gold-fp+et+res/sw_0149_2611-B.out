 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 you know that's a good way to approach it 
 I've never thought about 
 I do plan my clothes a week in advance 
 Actually I plan them a month in advance 
 I usually do a month at a time 
 so I don't repeat an outfit
 But I've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on Monday because really no one's paying attention 
 But anyway I really I don't work outside of school 
 I work in the computer lab at school 
 so I can just wear whatever I have on for school 
 an and and really it's 
 I try to dre- dress presentable but very comfortable
 Like in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that 
 and then in the winter time it's jeans or or pants 
 I usually you know 
 college is so casual 
 you really don't want to dress up unless you you have a job 
 and you have to be there right after school or something like that 
 so 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Oh 
 Well that's good that they're so casual
 I mean my brother works for T I 
 and he's a computer programmer or computer engineer 
 And you know whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear a tie or a dress shirt everyday 
 But he goes to work in his blue jeans t-shirt and tennis shoes 
 and he just loves it
 Yeah 
 That's what I've heard
 But I mean they they just moved into the new building 
 he calls it the new building 
 I don't know 
 it's where all the executives are
 And and so they were they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans 
 But he just left for Italy today at four
 and he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them
 Over in T I mean for T I but over in Italy
 yeah 
 he was so excited about going
 But he didn't carry any ties or anything because he he just went over there with the that attitude well if I don't take it then they won't make me wear it 
 Because he just he didn't you know 
 he's not really into all that 
 He would wear it if he had to for his job and all 
 but you know if he had the preference I mean his his preference is blue jeans and a t-shirt 
 so 
 But I think that's great about T I 
 and also to get off the clothing the smokers you know how they have the the different designated areas for smokers and stuff
 I think that's great
 really 
 Do you smoke
 Uh-huh 
 I think that's 
 Well y- you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college 
 Well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions 
 and 
 See that's how that's how I am 
 but my mamma was not raised like that 
 and so 
 me to 
 boy I have to hunt them down 
 Uh-huh 
 That's great 
 I wanted to take a sewing class at school 
 but I just haven't fit it into my schedule yet 
 but that I mean that can really benefit
 that's something that I'd be very interested in very interested in learning
 they're outrageous
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah it's it's marked up 
 It is it is really outrageous 
 but I mean like whenever I I was growing up and all my mom 
 I never understood this then 
 but I do now 
 but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars 
 or or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that 
 and she always told me it was because I was still growing 
 and she wasn't going to buy me something I was going to grow out of next week
 Yeah 
 no 
 Uh-huh 
 That's the best way to shop 
 I mean I always thought my mom was being mean to me 
 but I look back at it now 
 and my child is going to 
 I mean I'm going to raise mine the same way
 I don't know 
 I just they're just so outrageously priced 
 it's just incredible
 I try to always catch the sales
 Always 
 Yeah 
 it it depends on 
 yeah 
 there's there's always a reason why they're on sale 
 So that that has a lot to do with it
 But 
 well 
 
 Uh-huh
 that's great
 Uh oh 
 no 
 Uh-huh 
 The defect
 Uh-huh 
 T J Max does that
 yeah 
 we have a T J Max over here 
 and
