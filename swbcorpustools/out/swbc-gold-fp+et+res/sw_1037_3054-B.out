 What was that
 And to the Brazos River near Dinosaur Valley State Park 
 Uh-huh
 What are they like
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it was a nine by twelve
 Uh-huh
 Well there well supposedly 
 they always say it sleeps more than it does
 But th- they 
 it would have slept three adults anyway
 Yeah
 Right
 Di- do they have a kitchen in them
 Trunk of your car all time right 
 maybe maybe back to Caddo or Purdis Creek
 Or I like Bob Sandlin too 
 it's a new park
 And there is not really camping 
 but 
 what is it called Cedar Hill
 Lake Joe Pool
 And sometime I like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma
 fr- from those three 
 just just from when I have been an adult I like Caddo the best
 Yeah 
 that's right
 It's not it's not very deep
 And they did build a dam on it 
 but it was there before they built the dam 
 It has been there for a hundred years
 Apparently an earth quake caused it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's really nice
 And I I don't know 
 probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in Texas 
 Right
 It was nice talking to you
 Yeah 
 you too
 Bye
