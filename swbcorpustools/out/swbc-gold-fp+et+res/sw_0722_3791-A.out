 so what would be the your favorite meal to cook
 Don't like to cook huh
 Make a mean spaghetti huh
 got kids
 M- 
 married
 Yeah
 Well uh- my wife and I and we've got a thirteen week old baby 
 so don't do much cooking for him yet
 
 yeah 
 what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party/
 and what kind of dishes you might have for it or some sort of thing like that
 Let's see a good dinner party menu
 I suppose it would just about depend on who was coming I guess
 You know something light and easy
 If it was pretty in- informal about anything
 Breast of chicken <>
 gosh 
 yeah 
 How do you usually cook your deer
 How do you usually cook your deer
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I imagine
 I would imagine it is
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I understand
 We just had deer stew sort of it was deer steak stew well about a day day and a half in the crock pot some deer steaks in kind of a mushroom gravy
 some veggies in it
 Delic- 
 No
 No 
 the times I've been out deer hunting I I can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa
 I mean I get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon 
 and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles
 So no 
 this was given to us by some friends
 guy was in a in a hunting club
 and you know 
 but the whole group goes out hunting 
 and then at the end of the day they split it 
 and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share 
 and the rest of it is split with the rest with everybody in the group
 Well he wou- 
 they they went out last year and almost everybody got it the limit
 so there's everybody had deer coming out their ears
 So 
 Yeah 
 they they gave us some deer 
 and some of it's still in the freezer 
 and they 
 about eight months ago they gave it to us
 We we either crock pot deer 
 or we'll you know put it out on the grill so that the bulk of the tallow will dribble off of it
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That is good
 Deer spaghetti is real good
 Anyway no 
 I think if I was going to have a dinner party I'd probably have sandwiches or something along those lines and then you know just something light finger food sort of something or Or maybe have something roasting out on the fire
 well anyway we don't do much in the way of entertaining
 Usually it's one other couple come over for a dinner
 Let's see what did we have the last time we had guests over 
 yeah 
 we had a a turkey loaf
 Which kind of taco turkey loaf
 It was good
 scalloped potatoes
 No 
 mashed potatoes
 Mashed potatoes with m- cheese melted over the top of them
 A couple things like that 
 It was pretty good little dinner
 Yeah 
 usually it's k- 
 don't you hate that 
 I've got a I got a few pounds to lose myself
 That's okay
 I've been fighting my weight since I was about ten years old
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I was left the fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade grade at two
