 Well I haven't had an awful lot of incidents regarding child care 
 When my two year old was in New Orleans she got bit on the cheek 
 and but that's about the the the extent of it
 But but but when 
 I really am a- am concerned about is that so many of these child care places are are coming under you know investigation for for you know child molestation
 And I and I and I'm saying to myself well you know y- you dump your your your little turnip off to you know this child care place 
 and they don't pay very much 
 and w- why why would they be interested in in your little turnip unless you know one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest you know 
 And that's a terrible kind of thing 
 and I don't think my children have ever been subject to that 
 but my wife didn't work 
 and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it
 Huh
 Huh
 well that's interesting
 my God
 Well you must have a just one hero ace professional job to support something like that
 well yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Well not not all of us 
 You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for 
 I'm an engineer
 And 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Five hundred dollars a week For two kids 
 That's incredible
 
 Well 
 W- 
 Yeah 
 You know 
 they could 
 somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare 
 and you know that's a good starting wage 
 but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care 
 Huh
 I mean we used <> to pay pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit 
 But mi- mine are twenty-two twenty-three and twenty-seven 
 so you know that 
 I guess baby-sitters now are up at what five dollars an hour
 my
 Uh-huh
 yeah
