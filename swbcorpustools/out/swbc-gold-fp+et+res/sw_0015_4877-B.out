 Uh-huh 
 How old are your children
 Uh-huh 
 Well they're going to be getting there
 Yeah 
 U- uh-huh 
 I see
 I have five children 
 I have a eighteen year old son 
 The rest of my girls are like twenty-three twenty-six twenty-eight and twenty-nine
 And I have three granddaughters right now
 And I 
 one's in Iowa
 And she's she's a teacher 
 and what she does is she teaches at a preschool
 And and so she kind of 
 and they let her bring her her little daughter in for free
 And then so 
 but she just works part-time
 Then I have another daughter in Bountiful Utah 
 and she has to work full-time 
 and it's just tearing her apart 
 She has a private baby-sitter
 And the baby just screams 
 I mean the baby is like seventeen months 
 and she just screams
 Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there 
 They're not even there yet you know 
 And and then I have my I have a seven month old granddaughter 
 and her mother stays home 
 and she they live they live with us You know in as Orange County is really expensive
 They live with us 
 and so of course we love it Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time 
 But she just 
 she used to work in pre in the preschool and and and child care 
 and she says after working in there 
 and and you know here she was a provider 
 but you know there's only so much one person can do
 She said it's so awful 
 She said she'll never put her child in a in a in a preca- in a p- in a preschool 
 I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere
 But it's really it's really really very difficult 
 and 
 Well when when 
 the the first ten years see first ten or twelve years I stayed home
 And then after that I I went to work
 And a couple of times I just you know 
 th- then I had one job 
 and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job 
 And then and then like about later I I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter 
 Supposed to be good recommended person from the church 
 and I knew her personally 
 She had two kids of her own and everything 
 But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child
 I mean first of all her children were sick all the time 
 So when my son stayed over there he got sick
 Same thing same thing that the her kids had 
 right
 And so we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock 
 Then he she'd take my son and her daughter over t- to kindergarten 
 But s- 
 that day I was saying now he he's sick 
 And she goes well she goes he has the same thing that all my kids have 
 That's what he got you know 
 Goes well okay 
 so it's not like he's going to infect her kids 
 But then what happened was is I said he just threw up 
 and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty 
 so she said well she'll keep him home 
 and he'll probably just sleep anyway
 Well you know what 
 that woman sent her sent him to kindergarten 
 She sent him to kindergarten 
 As soon as he went there the teacher took one look at him 
 and he threw up again 
 and they put him in the nursery they put him in the nurse's office 
 And then what happened was is you know they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter 
 Called her 
 and they said that he's sick 
 Well she wasn't home
 I mean her all her kids were sick 
 but she wasn't home right 
 And her and her her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick 
 Now why didn't he why didn't she keep him home with her 
 No 
 she didn't do that 
 So it got to the point where he's he's supposed to get out of kindergarten like about two thirty 
 And I had to leave work 
 It was it was five o'clock in the evening 
 and I found out he was still there at school 
 And they were calling me 
 and they said somebody's got to pick him up 
 And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school 
 I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff 
 And he had a hundred and four fever 
 They couldn't give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything 
 I was so furious 
 I I quit that job 
 and I stayed home for awhile longer 
 Then I went and got a a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better
 Yeah 
 but I haven't had any good really very good experience with child care
