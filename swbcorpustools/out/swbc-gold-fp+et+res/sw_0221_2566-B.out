 No 
 I don't
 Do you
 Uh-huh 
 Did you ever have her in child care
 Uh-huh
 And how did you choose that sitter
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Really
 It's hard to find people like that
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Well that's neat
 Yeah 
 Do they have classes for them during the summer too
 Huh
 Yeah
 What kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took her over there
 good 
 I'm glad to hear that
 Yeah 
 Right
 Yeah 
 Did you did you introduce your daughter to her before you made your decision
 Really
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Get a real job full time
 So what made you decide to put her in a Montessori school
 Uh-huh Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 That's the true test
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's good 
 that is good then
 No 
 especially we're going to spend the next eighteen years in school 
 Yeah 
 really 
 That's right 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I have a nephew 
 He's a little brat
 He goes to a really crummy day school 
 <> My sister's not real bright 
 so but he he's <> always sick 
 I mean he has always got some kind of cold or something 
 And I don't know 
 I don't think this place is a very good place for him
 It's just kind of convenient 
 and she's the kind that goes for convenience over anything else
 Yeah 
 Exactly
 Yeah 
 I don't think she checks things out very well Which really surprises me 
 It is scary 
 Yeah
 I know
 I would be too 
 Yeah
 Too many horror stories out there that you know 
 yeah 
 That's right 
 I think that's an ideal situation
 Yeah 
 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Is that where the 
 over there off of like 
 I'm not sure what the street is 
 is it off of near Country Club
 and all 
 yeah
 Yeah
 I I I've seen the signs 
 but I've never actually seen the place itself you know 
 It's pretty set far back off the road
 Yeah 
 Definitely
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 Yeah 
 There's a difference
 Uh-huh
 Ye- 
 Yep
 That's right 
 Or you know or a car accident
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 No 
 because that all wears off
 Yep
 Really
 I would be too
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I know 
 It is scary
 Do they teach them in school right now where she's at about drugs
 Good
 Right 
 Right
 And what to do when they're faced with it
 Yeah 
 It is
 Uh-huh
 I can see it too
 Uh-huh
 Nothing wrong with that 
 Yes 
 You do
 I don't I don't think there's anything wrong with that
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Now you understand 
 That's what I'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say when you have kids of your own you'll understand 
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Yeah We'd like to *[[should be two slash units]]/
 Yeah
