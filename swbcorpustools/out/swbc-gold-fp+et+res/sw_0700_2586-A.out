 So do you fish
 from a boat or from shore
 that's nice 
 mostly catfish 
 or 
 Yeah 
 A real light line real light rig
 Well that sounds like fun
 Fish in Colorado s- different than that 
 Mostly trout in the mountains
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 mountain streams and rivers

 very Yeah very much there you know
 by and large no 
 But but they're big fun
 What
 I I I'm a fly fisherman
 Yeah 
 I I cast a ways 
 I'm not highly proficient 
 but it's fun
 Well let me explain fly fly fishing to you then 
 You're not casting a weight on the end of the line
 You're casting the weight of the line
 Yeah 
 well the fly on the end weighs nothing 
 It weighs less than the line
 So what you do is you strip off four five six little rolls coils of line into your hand
 And you whip the line
 As you whip it over your head or side to side you slowly feed out more and more
 Well no 
 no 
 You fish upstream
 Right 
 And then you let it carry it downstream
 And then you reel it in 
 and you do it again
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 Yeah 
 exactly
 Jump at it 
 from what I'm seeing and hearing and all the the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern
 No 
 no 
 It it looks like a grub 
 Yeah
 Okay 
 whenever you yeah 
 a lure a fly
 Whenever you have a something that looks like something else
 and it's a fly you call it a pattern
 All right you know there's bumble bee patterns there's excuse me there's bumble patterns there's mosquito patterns there's wasp patterns there's grub patterns
 
 
 You can buy them 
 I've got some 
 And They seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall
 Yeah 
 yeah
 You know how that changes the phase of the moon 
 and 
 Yeah

 It It it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day
 Yeah
 Well there you fish mornings and evenings And nights
 Yeah
 It at times gets incredibly hot here
 June
 Oh
 Yeah
 Fishing is not just just dragging fish out of the water 
 It's it's a total experience you know getting out in nature and hearing the crickets and listening to the birds and seeing the squirrels and camping out and eating out of doors 
 and 
 I probably ought to 
 I just freeze
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well you know ankle deep or standing on the bank and slipping it out there
 You know I always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it out there 
 and you know how it is 
 The water's kind of 
 And then you're in to it just a little bit 
 and then you splash in 
 and the next thing you know your knees are wet
 got a stepdaughter
 She's real sweet 
 And at times she enjoys it at times not
 A fuzzy little dog
 Oh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you guys sure want to be out of range
 It takes time
 Yeah 
 Last year we had a just a wonderful trip up to Travers Lake 
 *[[ Trapper's Lake in Colorado ]] it was cold and rain the whole time 
 And we still had a good time out of the deal
 and Colorado is a beautiful place to live
 Well and you've got to have 
 you've got to work for a living
 What division you all in
 What division are you all in
 Oh
 Well the only thing up here is division one
 yeah
 Okay 
 Yeah
 fishing's fishing is fun up here 
 It's not 
 It seems like the success ratio the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there 
 But it is fun
 You know The the experience is is better up here I think
 You know it seems more relaxing there's more to look at
 And and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul You know if you're if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake
 Yeah 
 it it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I- 
 it gets f- foamy almost
 And you know it's just pure and pristine And the froth 
 and
