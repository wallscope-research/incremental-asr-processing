 personally I don't have a problem with it 
 I think as far as protecting fellow employees protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do it's justified 
 On the other hand I do agree that it's it's a it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work
 I would never I would never have a problem with anyone testing me 
 but I can understand why people would object 
 So I guess I guess I'm kind of mixed on it still at this point
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 That's absolutely right 
 It it I guess it all comes down to you know a a definition of how much out outside activities affect your work 
 and granted you know that 
 any any kind of drug use on on company property and whatnot is is definitely not acceptable 
 I don't think anybody would ever argue that Or any any after affects carrying over into the workday 
 but you know I don't I'm not particularly concerned with what people do after they leave for the day especially if I don't if I don't see any results of it the next day 
 Well it it is it you know 
 on the other hand you you've got you've got the the possibility of people 
 you've got some people could be arrested for drug use drug dealings and things like that 
 and if their if their employers name hits the papers and that it's it's it's a mark against them 
 the company and you know what kind of people work there what 
 That's right 
 That's right
 Right 
 E- even if it is you know a company policy of immediate termination or whatever they still have to replace them
 And there's there's a lot involved there
 I think I think the regular schedule stuff that when you say everybody get out of it that's a good point 
 I never really thought of it that way
 Yeah 
 if they really can 
 I think the big- the biggest problem I've got is is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment
 as far as the new hires I I hired on just early enough that I I missed it where the new hires were concerned 
 but not nobody no 
 I don't think anybody questions that testing someone as a as a precondition to being hired 
 but for the conditions that for our employment to change while you're on the job that's I I don't know that that's where I think that most people get upset 
 It's you know it it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically 
 and It's just it it's a really tough question 
 and it you know it 
 people have have really quieted down after everything started 
 but I still think there's a lot of there's a lot of resentment
 Uh-huh
 You bet
 No 
 that's right 
 Yeah 
 I I know of some people who did 
 it was it was indirectly related {D you know 
 } they could always come up with other reasons 
 but it it had a lot to do with it Just the the whole attitude 
 because it's really it's just really 
 it it seems so un- 
 T I you know with the the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have to all of a sudden search for attitudes and whatnot 
 You know there's not a lot of pressure to to vote the right way or anything else around T I 
 Like there like there is in some companies or at least you know 
 from what I've heard 
 but 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 No 
 I 
 Absolutely not you know 
 it's it's it's you know 
 if you hired me I'll be you know 
 supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with 
 so you know let's let's stick with that original trust I guess
 But it's it's still it it still remains a tough question 
 and it's there's a lot of you know the whole the whole department of defense reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot 
 There's a lot of different things that come into play 
 but that was 
 I think everybody everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company
 Uh-huh
 I really don't think so
 Yeah 
 I really don't because some people are going to are are going to risk it 
 it may prevent e- 
 I I guess I guess what I'm trying to get at is if it if it if it does help a few individuals maybe maybe it's worth it
 you know it may prevent somebody who was was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot 
 but I don't know if you know the 
 it's it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation 
 I don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much 
 There there's still a big question in my mind 
 that the the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of of mistakes on the testing is something that still bothers me 
 It it's 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Absolutely 
 And that 
 I I don't know if I don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too E- even if you you know if you take a a drug that was presc- prescribed for you 
 but the the prescription has run out you still had some left 
 and you happen to take an extra penicillin 
 well penicillin's not on the list 
 but you know 
 yeah 
 I I think you understand what I'm getting at
 it it can still show up 
 and it can still flag as a positive 
 and and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent
 and those are the kinds of things that still can show up
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 That's right 
 I even had friends when I was going to college who were in pharmacy school 
 and they could legally provide medicine to their family mens- frie- family members and friends 
 certain medicines were were legal now 
 I I I believe you know any of the any of the ones we would we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists
 but there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications 
 and that can happen 
 But 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I think so 
 You too
 Good-bye
