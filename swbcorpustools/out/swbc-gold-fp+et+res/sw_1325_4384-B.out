 Yeah 
 That's the only thing I've ever done also is baby-sit
 But uh I've heard people that I work with talk about you know child care 
 Especially I guess it's even harder on single mothers
 Yeah 
 Having to pick up the kid by you know six o'clock 
 or it's five dollars for every minute you're late And stuff like that 
 Which is understandable 
 I mean these people can't you know stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late 
 but 
 Oh no
 Yeah 
 It's hardly worth your time 
 Yeah 
 That's pretty bad 
 The only time I baby-sat was in high school 
 and it you know 
 of course you don't ha- 
 I didn't pay taxes on that 
 so
 It was easy you know go over to some uh 
 it was these people that lived in our neighborhood 
 and I'd just go over there 
 Every Thursday night they went to the theater 
 They had permanent tickets 
 and they'd give me 
 it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids 
 but they would usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night
 And I mean they'd you know 
 it was great 
 I'd go over there 
 and there would be like uh you know there's we have these videos over here 
 Watch whatever you want 
 And there's some Oreos in the in the cupboard 
 And there's some Coke 
 and you know just help yourself to anything 
 So it was it was you know the best 
 that was a long time ago 
 and that was only for a few years 
 Just once a week
 But I don't know
 Oh yeah 
 That's true 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 She does take up 
 and they do take up a lot of your time 
 That 
 They're very demanding 
 
 
 Oh shoot 
 My mom would be like uh eat it or don't eat anything 
 That's right
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I think 
 yeah 
 I think the best way to go would just be to to be able to do it out of your basement
 And just have like t- at the most like ten kids 
 And all from maybe people that you know type of thing 
 Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and 
 Yeah
 More than what it's worth
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well yeah 
 That's 
 yeah 
 exactly 
 When you have like a Kindercare or something set up and th- when they get greedy or whatever that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something
 And that's just you know 
 you can't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time 
 You know you never know what they're going to get into
 Oh that's horrible
 Huh
 Yeah 
 That's i- 
 yeah 
 that's a hard thing about it 
 If I mean I don- I can't foresee myself getting married 
 but if you know if I ever wanted to have a kid how could I work 
 I mean I don't think I could trust somebody with my kid either 
 Unless it was a friend that you know did it in {sounds like an airplane} their house that I knew well
 I just I couldn't do it I don't think
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 just besides the fact that you know your when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait
