 What do you think invades your privacy <>
 M C I 
 what's that
 now see I I really don't have much trouble with I just say no thank you and hang up
 I had a carpet service call up three times all within in an hour 
 but I I do telemarketing
 so I'm very polite [ 
 and I just say no thank you + and say no thank you ] very politely 
 and I hang up and don't bother me after that
 So I think the only thing that really bothers me is if <> when somebody contacts me 
 and they try to get information out of me
 Like the Census Bureau United States Census Bureau 
 That bothered me
 I didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even
 That I think is my invasion privacy because it's the government 
 and I don't understand what their need to know is
 And I think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy If somebody wants personal information out of me 
 but telephone calls I figure they don't bother me one way or the other
 I know when I do telemarketing I'm a soft person 
 if if someone says I am not interested I'll just say fine and back out
 And I make very good sales 
 but I'm not as I said I'm not half as pushy as these people because I don't really care 
 I mean if if they're not interested fine 
 You know that's it 
 Right
 And I'm not pushing something down their throat that I don't think is a good item anyway
 That I don't think I could do anyway 
 But I feel like movie stars or 
 sure it's part of their I guess they're portray being a movie star 
 they get themselves in these rag sheets 
 but I think they go too far
 I think that's invasion of privacy
 Yeah <> 
 yeah
 No 
 I think my seriously my classification of of invasion of privacy is trying to get personal information and putting it falsely out or just bombarding me for the answers
 Right
 This to me is is my invasion of privacy
 Anytime I can honestly say no or throw the paper away or 
 but you can always write to oh I forgot the name of it and stop the junk mail 
 That I've done Because I don't want junk mail anyway 
 so I c- wrote to them when it came on the air 
 so I don't get any of that bull 
 tha- it works by the way
 But the telephone doesn't bother me because I leave it half the time on you know answering service anyway unless I'm home 
 so I figure I can turn it off one way or the other 
 but I think that's the only bottom line thing that I dislike 
 Because it does 
 other than the U S Census 
 what was it 
 the the carpet place that called me three times 
 that I felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place and called me three times
 I mean one should be sufficient
 But if people don't use the telephone 
 it's like I don't know when the police has their project going 
 and I don't know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things 
 That's the only way I know
 And that's i- 
 Well see there's no way of knowing
 that's you know that's the problem 
 Like the product I sell I sell mostly to older people which can't get it in a normal public situation 
 The only way we'd get to them is by telephone
 And most of them like it because the company I work for is nationwide and reputable 
 and they know that hey we're backing it one hundred percent
 But if we were denied the right to call people up these people would never be able to get it 
 Because your normal companies that offer it do not offer it in the amounts that we do 
 and they'd never have it then at that point
 Because we offer it in a very low you know quantity
 So I mean I I don't know what to do as far as that's concerned 
 But it is nerve racking 
 I mean it is nerve racking to have the telephone 
 but at least as I said you can always say no thank you 
 I gather you get a lot of telephone calls
 Yes 
 yes 
 yes 
 In other words you own your own home
 I think that's where they hit most of us 
 Like I own my own home
 And you just know about what time 
 like some days I hate staying home because the phone rings all the time 
 but I don't know 
 I haven't been able to figure that out 
 Something else to do about it 
 When they call up and want to say well tell me this this this this and I'll give you a free something or other My answer is no thank you I don't need it 
 And they say well don't you want to know what's free 
 and I s- no 
 If I have to give them so much to answer the questions to get fifty rolls of film or something like that they're taking something away from me 
 and I don't like that
 Uh-huh
