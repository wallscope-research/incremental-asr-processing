 Well I'm kind of that way too 
 I work in the legal department 
 and where we are now what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents
 And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day 
 it always seems like I'm doing that 
 and I can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry you know boxes of documents around 
 so if I'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents I dress down 
 But if we're going to have a meeting where we're having the attorneys come in or people from other party's attorneys and stuff then I normally dress up 
 Yeah 
 and I'll wear a dress and hose and stuff
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 that's right
 As a matter of fact I thought I had one funny story 
 when I was at T I the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes 
 We had them in the warehouse
 and at that point it the warehouse was over across the road 
 and it wasn't air conditioned 
 and it we were there like in the middle of the summer 
 it's unair-conditioned 
 it was dusty and dirty 
 there was like a fan at the very end of the row 
 and that was it 
 And so we didn't really know we weren't supposed to 
 we thought T I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job
 we wore shorts 
 We didn't know that was a big no no
 And the supervisor from another area came up to us 
 and you know this area where record retention is there's only a few people that work there 
 and he sho- he knew who worked there 
 he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there 
 And he came up to us 
 and he just said who's your supervisor 
 Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor and our supervisor's supervisor 
 and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts 
 He didn't at at least say to us did you know you're not supposed to do that 
 That could have alleviated a big problem 
 We ended up getting called out on it
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 
 
 Yeah
 
 Well I've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine
 And they have said no 
 Yeah
 I know I didn't know that E D S has a very strict dress code 
 I had a friend
 definitely 
 I had a friend who worked there for a year or so 
 and they spell it out 
 For men it's particular suits the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and win- wing tipped shoes
 it is definitely lined out 
 Women are not allowed to wear slacks 
 you wear coordinated suits
 And and a particular kind of shoe you know so high heel 
 it is spelled out
 When I was looking at her materials when she first started you know she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff
 And it told about the dress code 
 and it said these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and hair just this way
 Yeah 
 and E D S is very particular about this hair cuts
 I mean it was like you can't have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just really detailed
 Well the the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had another person coming from Washington our outside counsel 
 And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse 
 but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse
 And she came with skirts just like she'd be going into the office
 And we'd try we'd try to say didn't you bring any pants or anything 
 We're we're out here in the warehouse you know 
 you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes
 and you're going to have un- unload you skid look at the documents in the in the boxes and then repack your skid 
 And she And she was so she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt
 She finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants 
 but you know I mean it was just completely miserable for her
 Some of our people in the legal department 
 we have assistants to the general counsel 
 and it's funny 
 because there's one that always wears a suit 
 A matter of fact he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned
 And then there's another one who's who's a little younger and a little more yuppish 
 and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt
 and sometimes he wears the jacket to it
 And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes 
 and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt 
 So that's just 
 With the you know the little suspenders or something on 
 so We've we've kind of had a variety there 
 but I think a lot of times it's it's mainly who they're going to meet with 
 or they're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are
 If there just going to be meeting with T Iers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the they're engineers that they're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed 
 and they're usually casual
 Yeah
 It's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here
 Yeah 
 this is this is kind of a fun project
 I've done some of the other speech programs 
 but we've never got to talk to another person 
 it was always just talking to the computer
 So this is a little different
 Yeah
 Okay 
 bye
