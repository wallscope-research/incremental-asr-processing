 it seems like an unusual subject this time of the year 
 but it's it's camping
 The last time I went camping was about in the middle of October 
 and we went up to Lake Bonham and really enjoyed it 
 Had a real good time with the family 
 We do an awful lot of camping 
 How about yourself
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 Very good 
 I bet it's pretty over there
 What do you think what kind of camping are you talking about 
 Do you go out 
 and is camping for you in a motor home or a trailer 
 or do you actually put up a tent 
 or 
 okay 
 so you have 
 Yeah
 A pop-up trailer huh
 We have a tent
 Yes 
 So I guess we really rough it
 And we really enjoy that 
 one thing I've done all sorts of camping 
 I've I've camped in the snow on a glacier 
 I've camped basically almost anywhere even to the point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that that camping trip and had to pack it back out
 Well we enjoy it yeah 
 But since I've been married and with a family we have to go where there's restrooms And playgrounds and so forth 
 so we really enjoy it 
 But also while I was growing up we did have a trailer 
 and I camped in that trailer and in a tent and in in log cabins and so forth too 
 So a lot of different things 
 And yes 
 I 
 to answer your questions earlier yes I we do enjoy fishing 
 and I do go fishing 
 Haven't done a whole lot down here 
 We recently moved from the Rocky Mountain area up in northern Utah down to here because of work and haven't been able to enjoy fishing like I used to up there which is clear water fishing and streams and and rivers
 We normally yeah 
 we did we did a lot of the fishing 
 but mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and and just going out and seeing what there was to see in the area
 yes 
 That's true 
 that's true 
 And *[[ slash error ]] No 
 *[[ slash error ]] we never did that 
 They 
 although I've stayed in K O A campgrounds we've never done that just to go around and camp 
 personally I when I when we were growing up and when we were going camping I thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground
 you know that was mainly for people in motor homes or or had trailers or and so on and so forth where you know we really wanted to go camping in a tent
 and K O A is is geared for the people that have a hookup 
 Right 
 exactly 
 and I started out basically camping when I was when I was in Boy Scouts 
 and we did an awful lot of that as as a Boy Scout group 
 As I mentioned earlier we went into wilderness areas 
 and we camped in the snow and in snow caves 
 and and 
 All right 
 And you got a lot of that in huh
 What do you like to do when you go camping
 Uh-huh
 Enjoy it huh 
 Tell scary or scary stories around the fire
 and 
 yeah 
 You know lots a lot of people I've talked to have said well isn't camping boring 
 Don't you get don't you get bored and not have anything to do 
 but I've found out that actually we we really enjoy getting away from the television the telephone
 and yes 
 Exactly 
 Get out 
 getting out and enjoying nature and each other as company when we're out camping
 Yeah 
 Running water
 and a private bathroom
 Yes 
 Yes 
 they really do they have a great time 
 and like I mentioned the we we've been camping a couple of times this year 
 and the last time was in October 
 and we went up to Lake Bonham 
 and there was a playground for them 
 so they had swings
