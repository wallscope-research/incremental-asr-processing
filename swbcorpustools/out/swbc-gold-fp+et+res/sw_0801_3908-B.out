 Well I think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home 
 That's probably one of the major changes I see over the last period of time
 I don't think so 
 I think it has come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities 
 but I still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals 
 In other words in some respects the other direction in some job markets they don't really want to be treated as equals
 Yes 
 I think that's generally speaking pretty true 
 And I think that's what we really ought to look at that going is if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay
 And that they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions
 and I don't think that we have gotten there yet
 boy
 I think it's generally that switch over 
 And and I think that switch over has been more in the work force 
 I don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force 
 I think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husband is having them on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home
 So they have one and three quarters jobs now Whereas the husbands have one and a quarter
 Yeah
 Yes
 Yeah 
 I think also in terms of parenting 
 I think there is going to be some increasing problem because I think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting
 and I am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it
 So I think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units
 Well I I think one of the things that always happens is I think is when the one end wh- you know were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work
 and then I think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties 
 and so the opinion of this career thing isn't all that it is cracked up to be 
 and I want to go back and do something else 
 I think we will probably see the sw- pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit
 Also much of it is driven by economics right now
 People have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in
 Yeah
 Well I think they ought to have the right
 I have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to com- or my wife and my daughter going into combat
 but I have problems with men doing that
 and I guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it
 It's nothing I would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it
 I agree 
 I think one of the other things that concern has concerned me a little bit 
 and I think I see some change in attitudes there 
 My wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home
 and there's has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence because if she did she would be out in the work force fulfilling herself
 And I hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do that's acceptable
 If they chose to go into the work force that's okay
 If they chose not to that's acceptable
 As equals
