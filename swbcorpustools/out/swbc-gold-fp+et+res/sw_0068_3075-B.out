 Lynn do you do you want to start
 Okay
 Do you want to tell me about summer vacations you've taken 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Which is your favorite
 Uh-huh
 Your family doesn't live close then
 Okay
 Yep 
 I understand
 Wow
 I've only been there once
 and I'd love to go back
 And it was 
 Yeah 
 it 
 we had a great time 
 Well we we as you do take family vacations sometimes one a year 
 and but this year we're not going to be taking one for several reasons 
 But vacations we really enjoy 
 I think we've been on three cruises
 And we we really love cruises 
 We've gone on CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES
 And we've gone fairly inexpensive from as most cruises go 
 we usually book just a month before it's ready to go
 And we get upgraded 
 Last ti- last two times in fact we had an outside room 
 and it was beautiful
 And we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around 
 It's kind of 
 my God you do everything
 You I mean you can be as busy as you want to be or as laid back as you want to be 
 You can sit in the sun all day around the pool 
 or you can take part in the games that they have going on 
 They always have bingo 
 They have a casino 
 they have a massage parlor 
 They have exercise 
 I mean you can do anything
 And that's just aboard ship 
 And then when the ship docks you get to go sight-seeing and shopping
 And that's quite fun
 Nassau San Juan Saint Thomas 
 We've been there twice 
 We went two cruises that hit those islands but with different people 
 We we've gone with friends each time
 And then we went to the western Caribbean which is Port Cancun Cozumel and Ocho Rios 
 Pardon me
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 And but it was wonderful 
 So we really like those 
 And I guess we just like to go someplace someplace entirely different 
 We've been to a few places in this country 
 We still have a lot to see though
 We're from Illinois originally
 And we've been down in Texas eighteen years 
 and so like you we always try to make it you know back home to see the relatives 
 We both still have family there
 And that's fun 
 It brings back a lot of memories
 things are different there though 
 They're 
 I don't know 
 It's just entirely different world than this area
 Did you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 that's great
 they they they really are 
 We've yeah as I said we've done them three times 
 We'd be going again this this year if circumstances hadn't changed 
 We we'd probably go 
 My husband would you know 
 the minute I said the word he he he's chomping at the bit
 He kind of likes the casinos a little bit
 But I like all of that
 I like seeing other countries and shopping in other places
 I like shopping 
 I can shop anyplace shop in London and France and wherever 
 Now my kids are moving to Toronto 
 so we're going to be able to go up there
 So I'm kind of looking forward to that except I hate to see them go
 But 
 that's what everybody says 
 and I I think it's 
 I think I'll try to stay away except my my second grandchild will be born in in the winter in January
 So that will be hard to stay away from
 Yeah
 Isn't that the truth 
 uh-huh
 Well there's all age grou- groups too 
 and that's that's kind of fun 
 you if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals you meet different people
 You may meet people you know thirty years older than you or younger 
 and everybody is really interesting 
 and everybody is there to have a good time 
 and 
 we've only gone on the seven day cruises
 They have shorter ones 
 and then they have ten day ones 
 But I think seven days is long enough for us 
 By that time we're ready to get home and get back to our routine
 I think most vacations seven days is enough for us 
 We've gone 
 I think when we went to England and France we were there ten twelve days 
 and that was pushing it a bit
 Yeah
 Well that that makes sense it really does 
 I mean we went to Panama too
 Went to Panama last August
 Our son-in-law is from Panama
 And we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents who live there
 And his father is a a doctor 
 and his mother is a kindergarten teacher 
 and they took time off 
 it was their winter 
 and they were having a little break 
 so they took some time off that they could show us around 
 And it it is a beautiful country
 It is beautiful 
 They have mountains 
 We were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore
 And it it is gorgeous 
 They live in a small town called David which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica
 And it's it's just it's just a gorgeous country 
 Most people don't realize it 
 I think if they could get tourists coming to their country they'd improve the economy considerably
 Yeah
 We really hope hope so
 Yeah
 Well that that's that's pretty good
 That's pretty good
