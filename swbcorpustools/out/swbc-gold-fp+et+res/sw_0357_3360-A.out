 I guess my personal opinion I I don't mind paying taxes necessarily 
 I I just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way
 sometimes when I hear what what they're even what even what the politicians are making you know when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that I think that's just a bit too much to be paying them 
 and that's all tax money 
 When you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much it's just billions of dollars 
 that's I think is just being thrown away
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Well I know any time there's there's a big budget cut you know 
 I work with the state 
 and any time there's there is a budget cut or crunches it's always the small guy that that gets hurt
 It's never the the person that's making a hundred thousand there 
 It's always the person that's making the least amount 
 and and sometimes we're running around there 
 I see these these supervisors running around having meetings 
 I I really don't know what they do
 I sometimes wonder are are they really doing anything 
 or 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well they got so many hidden taxes that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store something like that and you're paying a little tax here 
 and you 
 so 
 Gas I don't know about you guys 
 but there's probably at least about twenty-five to to thirty cents of different taxes on on our gas
 And you don't realize
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well I know they say like with Reagan they say no new taxes 
 but they changed the deductions on you 
 and that just raises your taxes you know they just get it a different way
 so I mean to me it did raise my taxes
 Yeah 
 I heard someone say that if they would just something about with the the defense budget all that extra money they're throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about six hundred dollars on an average six hundred dollars
