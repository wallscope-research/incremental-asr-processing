 I heard that was excellent
 Is it
 I wanted to see that 
 I was deciding between that and MY GIRL 
 and my boyfriend and I went to see MY GIRL
 it was excellent 
 It was a really really good movie 
 I'd recommend it
 I heard the opposite that you should take children to see it
 there were quite a few kids in there with their parents
 Yeah 
 I don't know though 
 I I've heard that and then what you just told me 
 so 
 Right 
 yeah
 It was sad 
 It was really sad
 But his it kind of shows how his best friend this little girl deals with his death and how I think maybe how children should deal with death
 Maybe
 But it was really good 
 It was sad very sad
 Yeah
 I heard it was sort of like not too violent 
 but it was kind of like gross kind of like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS like
 really
 Oh

 but I 
 Yeah
