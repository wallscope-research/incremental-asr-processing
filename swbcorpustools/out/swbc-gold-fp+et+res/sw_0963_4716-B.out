 that's pro- I probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way I think
 I definitely think that there some things shouldn't be limited like like you said rifles and hunting rifles and possible handguns for people who use them to 
 Right 
 And but I think the I think semiautomatic weapons people say they use them because it for sport 
 But I I personally cannot see any use for them other than for for like people who dislike have some sort of crazed you know ambition to use have high powered weapons or something
 Right

 And people who people who have them and are responsible with them are are are being punished

 Well I think I mean we I grew up in a family 
 and and my father had two guns
 because he used to hunt years ago

 But and I knew we had the guns in the house 
 and th- the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time 
 but we it was never my brothers sisters nor I never I mean none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun 
 or let's go get the gun 
 it was just something you knew was there
 and th- it was your father's 
 and y- you that was not something you'd go and play played with at all
 and I think maybe and that's the type of the thing that should be you know stressed
