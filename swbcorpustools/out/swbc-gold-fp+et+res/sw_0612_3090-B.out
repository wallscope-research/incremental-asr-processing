 No 
 I don't use a family budget 
 my father who is very old has kept one his entire life
 and I probably re- rebelled against it
 I probably should have kept one 
 He keeps every penny that comes in and goes out on a very strict percentage
 Right
 I think it makes much more sense
 and I have recently gotten out of debt and everything 
 and I will probably ke- start keeping a little better track of it
 I just spent whatever came in and and didn- never knew what came in and what went out But just you know like about like the government runs
 
 So I think it is probably better to have some sort of a a at least a record 
 but my dad was so precise that I mean if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what it was spent 
 And that was put over there 
 and I mean of course he is from the depression 
 and so you know it's his life
 but I would I think it would be smart if somebody would keep some sort of a plan that works for them
 Yeah 
 it is
 I'm a historian 
 and my father had kept them I think since nineteen twenty-seven 
 and but he burned the ones from twenty-seven to fi- 
 I could not believe he did that 
 but then so I took the ones from fifty-two on to the present
 but to look to have looked back into the twenties thirties and forties it would have been fantastic to see that 
 But 
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 I know 
 Right 
 I know 
 well even in nineteen sixty-three 
 I found a record that I had I travel in Europe a lot and I what I had paid for hotels
 And a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now
 And I paid between four and five dollars in nineteen sixty
 And that's really crazy 
 cause that's about thirty years ago
 But of course it's just what the market will bear
 If people will pay two hundred then why charge ten 
 You know 
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well then you never know how they will 
 one 
 they may flip flop when they get to be ol- we- older 
 The other one may be very careful
 and she may marry somebody 
 and of course it would be good because it you marry somebody a little loose then she will have that stability of watching 
 You should have one in the in the in the house 
 And I think 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's about the way it is here
 if it had not been for my wife I would have probably been in debtor's prison if we had one
 So but what does you husband do now
 Oh
 
 yeah 
 You have to do it when you are in school
 My wife is still in school getting her doctorate
 and it 
 and I have got 
 
 I I know 
 We had three in college plus my wife 
 so that was four
 So we were both in the same 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That is the best one
 Yeah 
 with education you can't take that away from you
 Right
 Sure
 Yeah 
 that's true
