 Yeah 
 Are you native to this area
 okay
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 it seemed like well you know last year was so strange having all those heavy heavy rains in April 
 and this year we really didn't have heavy rains until May 
 Kind of like pushed the season back a little farther 
 and now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity 
 and it just tried to rain 
 I mean I was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago 
 and it was trying to rain which seems strange to have it raining in July 
 Normally we don't have too much humidity or or rainy time when it's past June
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well yeah 
 see I I lived in Ohio mainly 
 I lived in Pontiac just a little while before I came down here 
 and you know so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather 
 It might rain on your little parade
 You know and here it was like pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime 
 and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out
 You could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do
 What part of Michigan were you living in
 Okay
 Yeah 
 yeah
 What brought you down here
 So you teach in Plano schools
 Oh
 Okay <>
 Okay
 Well yeah 
 I think a lot of people were leaving Michigan all about the time I came here in the early eighties 
 and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus
 You know the the little joke about will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light 
 Well you know I I said I lived in the Pontiac 
 I didn't live in the city of Pontiac 
 I lived to the west of it 
 I forget the the county 
 but you know where all the lakes are around there
 I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes 
 It was real close to where I worked 
 It was only like four miles to work 
 and it was wonderful being on the lake like that 
 You know in the summer you feel like you're you know on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake 
 and everybody's you know out enjoying the water and such 
 and in the winter time the lakes froze over 
 you could still kind of go sledding and such out there 
 but I thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes 
 There's lots of really small ones out there
 You know like maybe a mile two long
 That's enough to do some boating
 and it was lots of fun
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 But it was yeah just lots of little lakes 
 and of course it was you know a little more expensive to live on the lake 
 but I just thought that was grand 
 And I think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them 
 but there was quite a few lakes all around there 
 It seemed like it was almost like you were living on an island 
 there was so much water around where I was 
 I said I wasn't close to downtown Pontiac 
 I was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from from the city limits 
 and it was really nice out there
 We had Pine Knob you know to go skiing and stuff
 So there were things around there 
 Really was pretty nice
 Right 
 right 
 in the summertime they have musicals there 
 and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 We used to have a 
 Christmas time some of our relatives would come up from Alabama 
 and I think most times we would have snow around Christmas 
 and the kids when they were young would just go nuts
 You know because they were from Alabama where it never snowed
 and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it you know eternally
 My first winter here 
 I I came down in early eighty-two 
 and there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December be- couple days before Christmas 
 It lasted only a few hours 
 like by noon it was gone
 And I remember getting up and somebody telling me hey better wait to go to work because the roads are all you know snow 
 And I was laughing going yeah right that's a good practical joke 
 ha ha
 They said no really there's snow 
 and there was but a very short time 
 and the weather got warm so quick
 it just melted it all away
 Course when we get an ice storm that's not too much fun
 Yeah
 yeah 
 I think it's fun 
 even the couple of ice storms I've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit 
 I mean sometimes the ice is pretty bad 
 but if you get on the the grassy kind of part you get a little bit of traction you know not slip and fall 
 I mean first
