 Do they feel that way
 Uh-huh
 Well I I think it's a good idea just because I'm opposed to to the drugs 
 I think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it
 It's 
 I don't know 
 I don't really liken it to alcohol 
 but yet that can be carried to an extreme too
 So I think it's a good idea 
 and I think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're 
 I don't know that their job would be at risk 
 because I think they may put them into some sort of a program to get them off of drugs
 I would think that 
 is that how they do it at T I maybe 
 That 
 Uh-huh
 Well I guess I I draw a hard line 
 but you know I would I'm I'm in favor of of that type of thing That you you have people out there that are responsible for certain things
 and you expect them to do their job 
 and it it is possible that you know that they can't do as good a job as they might do
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 and you never know 
 they could just go off the deep end on on a on something that whatever they're taking at the time 
 and and it would be you know out of the question
 Also I guess you can you know get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever all kinds 
 I sub in the schools 
 so I've you know had a 
 they they talk a lot about drugs there 
 and I think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools
 But you know I think they can test all they want for drugs you know 
 and if they need to do that as a condition for employment 
 and I know many of them are doing it 
 I know my son has had to do it for both Sam's and Wal-Mart
 and I don't know how many others are doing that 
 and and I think that's good because so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at an early age 
 and I don't know 
 it's just a problem that p- no one is sure just how to handle I think
 Really
 It's that high
 Oh
 I didn't realize it was that expensive
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Just lucky to have jobs 
 Uh-huh
 I just I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period
 and Sam's and Wal-Mart are are owned by the same people
 he took one for for Wal-Mart for job hiring 
 and then Sam's called him 
 and and he took another one
 and I you know I don't know why they both made him do that since it was so close together 
 I can see if 
 because you know if it's a thousand dollars that's a thousand dollars they wasted
 Well maybe they run 
 I don't know you know 
 that's just guessing it 
 Maybe they run a lot of other tests 
 or maybe it's under a health type program that it it it would catch a lot of things 
 I I just can't imagine them screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them
