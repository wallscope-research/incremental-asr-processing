 All Right 
 Ladies first
 *[[slash error]] Barney Fife I guess
 *[[slash error should be 'bf']] Well some- 
 so your a homemaker
 I guess that's the right term nowadays
 Yeah 
 My wife 
 we have a new one in the house 
 and she stays home too also
 I guess I have a wide variety 
 I like watching the T V for things that are interesting 
 not so much the bor- things that aren't 
 for example like the COSBY SHOW to me is just kind of like a waste of my time and DIFFERENT STROKES 
 But I like SIXTY MINUTES PRIME TIME LIVE 
 Of course I have to watch cartoons on Saturday morning but not the NINJA TURTLES 
 I like the old-timey ones TOM AND JERRY
 There you go
 Right
 JOHNNIE QUEST the good ones
 now if I'm ever home during the during the day on a vacation day I have to catch at twelve o'clock the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW because I usually because he's just he's one of my idles
 And then but I don't know 
 it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic you know magnified and animated that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings
 And so now I do with the COSBY SHOW 
 I have seen it a couple of times 
 and I do 
 I like the show 
 I just don't watch it Because of the timing 
 but some of the crap that's on T V nowadays it's about 
 I do watch the special shows that they come out with the NOVA stuff And and the nature shows
 But I think there's enough out there to pick from 
 I'm not 
 we don't have cable to the point of of the H B O or any of that stuff
 Yeah 
 But 
 Huh-uh
 Sure
 me
 no
 *[[slash error]] Ouch 
 Fifteen years
 Bet they hated that
 goodness
 Yeah 
 Really 
 I used to watch 
 I can recall 
 this might age me date me here 
 I can remember staying home when I was five and six and my mother watching the EDGE OF NIGHT
 SECRET STORM
 Well I think they were back to back and black and white
 I was just a youngster 
 and I was like my gosh 
 Still be on
 Yeah 
 Now they got a lot of other crap involved 
 And so 
 You're right 
 I think some of the tones of the the daily prime time is questionable
 And that could be 
 I have to agree with you
 You know keep them on the channel eleven channel twenty one The nature stuff you know 
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Well sounds like you got your hands full there 
 and I do appreciate speaking with you
 Have you gotten your catalog yet
 Yeah 
 I just spoke with Jim 
 I just got my in the mail 
 *[[sp mine]] and it inspired me to make more phone calls 
 really
 Yeah 
 Give them your pen number
 *[[sp: pin]] Have a good day
 Bye-bye 
 Bye-bye
