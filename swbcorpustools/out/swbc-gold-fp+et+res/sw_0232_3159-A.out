 Okay 
 do you subscribe to magazines yourself
 I see 
 I get MCCALL'S 
 Of course anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest
 And then once in a while I'll pick up a WORKING WOMAN or something and realize why I don't want to re- go back to work What I enjoy about staying home
 And I read magazines mainly because they're fast 
 and if I want to relax while I watch T V 
 of course I'm one of those that does two things at once 
 and I read GOOD HOUSEKEEPING and BETTER HOMES and MCCALL'S 
 And I like them because they're kind of short and to the subject
 Uh-huh 
 And then you stopped them all
 I find that about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular 
 and then I kind of get turned off by it Other than GOOD HOUSEKEEPING 
 GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that kind of sets around for when when I'm really have time and I really want to read something you know
 I don't get into books too often because I have so many things that I stay occupied with on a general basis 
 and we travel a lot 
 so I enjoy reading parts on travel in the various you know different ones
 And I get into newspapers 
 so I guess that kind of tells you what kind of person I am 
 I'm re- read it fast and put it down 
 Right
 Well That's what I do 
 You clip recipes 
 and you save them forever 
 and you never really use them
 And then every so often you weed through them 
 and you think where did I ever put that recipe
 But that's mainly my whole idea on you know short subject reading and things like this 
 I I subscribe like I said to a few 
 and once in a while I buy that new magazine called FIRST on the newsstands or something like that 
 But I kind of stay with my own subject matter what pertains to my daily life at the present time
 Right 
 Well sometimes if you know if you're in transportation in public transportation I know that people will read them on something like that
 But I think 
 and the idea is to is and good 
 I can just dump them at the other end 
 and I don't have to carry them back with me
 I do that when we travel 
 I always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we 
 no matter what it is air travel or anything and I 
 Right 
 al- although now 
 That's when you really have time 
 Now see your computer ones 
 I got into computer work somewhat 
 we have our own computer system at home
 and I tried reading the magazines hoping I would get more from it 
 and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as I went along
 It was you know kind of a little bit more than what I needed 
 so I never did get into them 
 I when I bought the computer all of a sudden I was receiving them for some unknown reason through the mail 
 I think they all that- thought well we have a live one She'll subscribe 
 But they were wrong 
 I never got into them 
 But but Okay 
 All right I guess we might as well end our conversation at this point
 It was nice talking with you
 Okay
 Uh-huh 
 Bye now
