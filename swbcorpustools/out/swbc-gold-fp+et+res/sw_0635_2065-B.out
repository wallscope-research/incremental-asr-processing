 I think it would be a great idea 
 I'm not sure about requiring it you know of people because people are going you know feeling resentful 
 I don't know 
 but I think it would be a great idea
 Seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of you know what they want to be or do 
 or you know they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time 
 and we sure our country all countries sure need help 
 so 
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 really
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Well I think that would be real interesting for people to do 
 but I guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries
 and but I don't know 
 If you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to really you know send children to do that 
 I didn't know
 Yeah 
 I was too
 I thought seriously about joining at that time 
 I thought it was a fantastic idea
 I sent off for stuff on it 
 but I don't remember that much about it 
 I know that they trained you in the language 
 and 
 You actually got paid too while in the Peace Corps 
 it wasn't much
 but I guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses and 
 Yeah 
 I think so 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 But it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here and take them to some other country that had different moral values like Saudi Arabia where they couldn't drink 
 Really 
 Yeah
 Public hanging
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I've heard that like in China and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered you know on the you know street 
 so 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's true
 People that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation you know like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that
 Might not go if it was voluntary 
 but I don't know how they'd enforce it 
 if it was 
 Yeah
 I don't know 
 Send them over to Iraq 
 Have a vacation in Iraq for a year 
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Well it seems like it would develop pride you know in people if if it's in their own country 
 It would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way 
 I I 
 it would take quite a few people 
 I think it might build jobs for people you know that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that 
 so maybe that part of it would be helpful too
 I don't know
 Like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Yeah 
 really there could be some scandals involved if you know it wasn't people that were really fair and le- you know in a legal way or something 
 they could send all the people over to you know one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had paid somebody to you know get supported 
 or 
 Yeah
 That could be a complicated too couldn't it
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 Unfair or something 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 Really
 Yeah 
 Well it seems like there's there's a lot 
 you don't hear much on the news about young people really you know wanting to do anything good or anything like that 
 but you know I'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing 
 I just I saw on the news the other night that the the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show Kisha Knight Pullman was starting a 
 I guess now she's practically a teenager
 She started some type of national organization for youth to volunteer to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards you know helpful things 
 and I know everyone like in the high schools in Dallas 
 there's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a minority you know 
 I think it was in a Hispanic area 
 they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers instead of they said all these gangs kids could join to belong
 But they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know
 so they were trying to start that out 
 so if there's people out there that are willing to you know kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy Gosh we ought to use them You know If their willing to do it
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 Huh-uh
 I see
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Well we belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints which is like the Mormon church
 And there there is men and also women 
 women aren't nearly as frequent 
 and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left that can volunteer to go on a mission 
 and they're all over the world 
 And its incredible logistics 
 I mean they have a training center where they teach them 
 it's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah 
 and they have to be taught the language and customs and all those kinds of things 
 and then they you know go and actually live in that country for the the 
 young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months
 Right
 yeah 
 He had a direct connection somewhere 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 They they don't get paid for it 
 and but there is funding that comes 
 they're supposedly saving up on their own 
 and the church helps them out some
 but you know that it is incredible you know
 Yeah
 Yeah
