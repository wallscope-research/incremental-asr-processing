 it's kind of hard to put my finger on a on a favorite T V program 
 however one that I've been watching for a number of years is DALLAS 
 And And it's going to be going off the air let's see a week from Fri- a week from tonight 
 It's going to be its last show 
 So I've I've kind of enjoyed watching over the years 
 I've been disappointed in it and also pleased in it 
 And I was greatly disappointed when I did move down to Plano to find out that the the great South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house
 Uh-huh
 well That's a shame
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well it's it's 
 when you look at the you know route seventy-five coming down there I mean it's actually a bridge
 but it's a bridge over top of roadway 
 There's no water there I mean 
 Yeah 
 Well there's there 
 well they 
 I think when they open the show up they give you two different views of Dallas
 One from the east and one from the west
 And that's why
 But it kind of confuses people 
 But I enjoy a lot of different comedies 
 I think it's mainly for an escape you know you my job is not the most thrilling in the world 
 and I enjoy laughing and some of the shows that are on the air some are just purely you know brain drainers
 And then there's other ones that deal with in a funny manner socially relevant things
 And one show that comes to mind is like DESIGNING WOMEN 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Yes 
 It it has been very entertaining 
 and and also the the issues they deal with really tends to open open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems 
 And I've I've really enjoyed that one since it came on 
 I don't like the politics surrounding the program though 
 but I mean other than that you know there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses 
 But 
 and then I've kind of gotten hooked on P B S stuff public T V 
 I like things like NOVA and some of the the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff 
 I just enjoy watching that stuff
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well I'm one of those rare guys who I I rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event if ever watch one 
 there's just not that much I'm I'm interested in 
 for a while I I I watched some football 
 but I've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and and watch a baseball game
 Uh-huh
 Well I think it was great when they were you know like world champs and they were doing real well 
 I I 
 personally I I came from the Washington area 
 And so I was a big Washington Redskins fan
 And when I came down to Dallas it was you know I found myself rooting for the home team 
 I 
 in fact I have a a baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker the only year they played together on the Dallas Cowboys
 wow
 Huh *[[slash error]] Yeah
 *[[should be independent slash unit]] Huh
 No 
 I haven't seen that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Gee I'll have to try to catch that sometime 
 It's 
 Yeah
 that's probably true
 Yeah 
 we don't either 
 I I couldn't rationalize paying you know 
 it's like if I pay for a movie channel then I have watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them 
 And if I you know if I didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic well I can get that for free 
 And well I really don't need C N N I see enough bad news all the time 
 I don't need to see more of it 
 So I I've kind of rationalized that it's it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see
 And of course when we were living in Texas it was real convenient with Tom Thumb
 You know having movies back then it was ninety-nine cents 
 I mean go 
 Yeah
 You can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like H B O or Cinemax
 Uh-huh
 yes 
 I do too
 Yeah 
 And I I've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it 
 She she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty 
 and you know she just doesn't like them 
 And she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie 
 And I've told her you know everybody I know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick
 And so I'm I'm hoping I can get her talked into it soon
 
 
 That's great
 Yeah 
 But as as far as regular T V shows I mean I've got some some shows that that that I would be afraid to admit to you that I've actually sat down and watched 
 And then there's there's others that I wish I had time to see 
 It's like I enjoy watching CHEERS 
 It's very funny 
 Some of the things in it are mindless 
 but I I just don't have time to watch it 
 I think about the only night that I really sit in front of the T V set all night long probably is on Monday night 
 Because I work so hard over the weekend doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday 
 Monday night I'm just worn out 
 So I kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and and look over things 
 And I can sit in front of the T V set and look at you know do go through my mail and and watch T V at the same time
 Uh-huh
