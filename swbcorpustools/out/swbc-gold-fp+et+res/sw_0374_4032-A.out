 Okay 
 Martin do you do any exercise
 Uh-huh 
 so those are more or less indoor sports 
 How's the weather out there in Georgia
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Well yeah 
 I'm on a exercise program 
 I'm riding my Aerodyne bike half an hour every morning 
 and I'm just about ready to up it to up to forty-five minutes a morning 
 and I feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time 
 It's it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise
 No 
 huh-uh 
 I first of all I'd like to get my weight off 
 I'm about fifty pounds overweight 
 and so I'd like to get the weight off 
 and then I'd really like to get into that
 And we have a my husband and I have a a aerobic video that's called The Firm 
 I don't know if you've heard of it 
 but it's a an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down 
 but you're using weights 
 and that is the most incredible aerobic workout I have ever done 
 It's it's really fun 
 Yes 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yes
 no 
 I mean yes 
 I am 
 but I have never done it myself 
 Have you done that
 Oh
 That's the big thing 
 Oh
 So how is that
 Oh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Now if playing basketball are you knees 
 do you have healthy knees 
 dear 
 Uh-huh
 that's good 
 Well that sounds you sound just like my husband 
 He he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball 
 and he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy
 So that's what he does 
 he wears his his brace and his high tops 
 and 
 Oh
 Oh 
 Wow 
 Uh-huh
 dear 
 Oh
 It is amazing how fast you take off the inches
 and I would once I start my forty- I'd like to do the forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week 
 and then every other day I'd like to incorporate the video and then the bike on the other day
 But it is really amazing how fast the inches come off 
 and the muscle builds real fast 
 you can start 
 they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month 
 and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your twenty-five pound dumbbells
 and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video 
 and it's a hour long video 
 so 
 It is 
 yeah 
 I really enjoy that 
 so I'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy 
 Yes
 Yes 
 Now this one has been quite mild 
 we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground 
 It was quite chilly 
 but not
