 So what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America today
 Yeah
 No 
 I have to I have to agree with you 
 I had occasion a couple years ago to hear the r- s- Chief of Police of Richardson Texas speak 
 and you know it's a shame a a criminal today not a murderer but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things and you know he does this and he does this for a couple of years hides all the stash and works off of it 
 and then when he gets caught he'll be sentenced to something like five to seven years 
 but he gets five days credit for every day he serves 
 I mean it's like a bonus to go to jail
 So subsequently a five year sentence means he's going to be out in a year on probation
 I mean what he does the chief said is he just merely goes back to his his stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate 
 and when he s- uses up all that and spends all that money then he starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing
 Now see that's a you talk about that's a crime right there
 Well we don't either in Texas
 Well it it certainly is 
 and that would be a huge concern 
 You know I don't think the general public really realizes this as far as what goes on with our criminal system our judiciary system and everything else 
 It's just it's terrible the way it is right now
 Yeah 
 as far as steps to reduce crime if it's crimes like we're just been discussing obviously we we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to take them off the streets 
 but I don't think that's going to happen because just like you said 
 and our state's a good example 
 your state's a good example 
 and it's just not going to happen 
 As far as the murderers and people that commit rape and things like that I'm not sure what's right 
 but I know it 
 it's not right to put them in there and let them live for years and years and leers w- years before you do execute them or whatever because it's has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him 
 and you know to I'm sure he gets to watch a lot of T V 
 and I'm sure they have exercise facilities and movies 
 and and everything else you know they can have a good time in
 No 
 it really isn't 
 A big 
 it's a big problem 
 and hopefully something will come out of it 
 So I don't know
 I'm I'm pretty much of a hard person 
 I believe in capital punishment 
 I mean you know a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone 
 I mean you know if it's just downright outright 
 Oh
 You bet 
 I mean that's the only way to 
 yeah 
 and you spend thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to take care of them and all you know 
 it's just unbelievable
 Can you really
 God
 I know 
 Meanwhile you're living in a country club situation perhaps you know
 Yes
 The drug problem that's another one
