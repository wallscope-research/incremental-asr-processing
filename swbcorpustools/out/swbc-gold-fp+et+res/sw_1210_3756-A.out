 Okay 
 have you painted something lately
 Yeah
 yeah 
 another bedroom
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 heavens 
 Well I painted the outside of my house and one bathroom 
 But I get I have that problem with the the ceiling you know the the blown blown ceiling You know where you get around the edge
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well how do you get the edge though
 The the straight edge 
 I see
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Well are you going to paint the outside of your house too
 really
 nice 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 that will be nice
 
 Or two tone or two tone You know
 Uh-huh 
 White
 But I have a problem 
 I can't get up high 
 and we can't paint the chimney 
 We have one of those ladders 
 We are just not willing to get up that high
 Well we did too 
 We did it in the fall 
 and it it's just too high 
 It is really scary 
 but and the only thing I would consider doing a professional maybe doing that 
 but it 
 other than doing our own work I prefer it to a professional
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 The blowers
 I know what you are talking about 
 scaffold 
 That's it 
 
 Its 
 Yeah
 my 
 So that was worth it getting a professional for that
 I think that is what we might have to do with this chimney 
 but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself
 It wasn't too bad 
 I mean you think 
 Shoot maybe a hundred and fifty
 Since it is a one story 
 but we did like two heavy coats over it 
 But then that way you know you are assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 My word
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 my word
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 my word
 So that was really worth it Painting his own house 
 my word 
 my word 
 Well he really saved in that way
 But yeah 
 I think we are going to do another bathroom 
 but I think I will probably just do it in a roller 
 I want to do it about the same color And just be a little 
 I know 
 But it's that it's the textured wall
