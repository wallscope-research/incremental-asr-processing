 Well let's see 
 I I like to go out to eat 
 I really do 
 but being from Dallas I think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open and close every we- month 
 and we ave- we have a really high turn over rate
 yeah 
 and and this is I mean there are streets just called restaurant rows 
 and you can get everything here from a very spicy Indian meal to you know the favorite barbecue and and just anything your little hearts desires around here 
 so here they have to entertain us to make us come back
 And I guess it's all one big game because you you just never run out of places to go 
 you really don't
 Yeah
 Really 
 and and we go to you know like an older part of town
 and we just notice how many well 
 that restaurant's changed 
 and gee there they've changed 
 and we've got to go try that one you know 
 and it's it's really 
 you have the pick of the you know the crop here
 Oh
 You know your your fourteen ounce steak with your potato and stuff
 you can get that too 
 No 
 they've got everything here from the French Room which is ultra ultra to Dean Ferrings restaurant which is the Mansion on Turtle Creek 
 I mean we've got beautiful places to go 
 You can get as dressed up or a- you know just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out
 So you know I guess some of the foods that we really enjoy though are the like Chinese
 and we're always searching around for Chinese 
 And now of course they've added the Taiwanese 
 and and various you know any any part of the country you want to hit they have got it 
 I mean Vietnamese restaurant we went to you know last week It's great 
 it's good stuff you kno-
 But it's so it's very very mixed 
 and you know I think if you like food like we do 
 I I don't know if that happened before or after we moved here 
 but you know you get a lot of great variety of things here 
 so 
 But if you were going to a restaurant say where would you go
 Right 
 okay 
 Oh
 Yeah 
 right 
 I see 
 That's true too
 To another place 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 well 
 there you go 
 yeah 
 we're sort of in the middle of the extension of the Cajun country too so we have a lot of ambiance provided by you know the the bands and everyth- you know like you said jazz bands and things like that 
 You know you go out 
 and you eat your crawfish and jambalaya and stuff 
 You know I I really don't like that stuff 
 but my husband does 
 He loves to cook it 
 so he and a friend of his get together 
 and they cook I mean you know like for a bunch of people
 and and it's really 
 in fact we do a lot more entertaining I think at home than we do going out 
 So when we do go out we really you know want to be wowed by the presentation so to speak
 And you know but but there are little places 
 and like I said some of our very favorites are the Chinese restaurants just to 
 and we do a lot of take out because everybody's so busy running around
 and it's the fastest thing to do 
 and so we sort of enjoy the you know both parts because *[[slash unit because A's next utterance is a backchannel of B58]] Uh-huh
 *[[ Should be indep slash unit ]] Oh 
 Right 
 Yeah
 Just to be abused by the meanest waitress *[[slash unit]] that's a talent
 *[[ Indep slash unit ]] 
 Got to carry through with the abuse huh
 gee 
 Well that's funny 
 I we just went to an Italian restaurant this 
 just wonderful 
 and they I mean 
 it's like being in It- 
 I mean I've never been to Italy okay 
 but it's just this big beautiful Italian restaurant 
 Very low key in terms of the people are from California you know
 so they have their own adaptation of what Italian is I mean 
 but it's it was a wonderful wonderful experience 
 You know they have women there going to S M U going to Southern Methodist University and and graduating in opera or something like that 
 and they are all singing arias to you and and just walking around the restaurant singing 
 and they make the food right there so it's display cooking 
 and and then they have wine casks all over the place so you're lined up waiting in line to this place 
 and you just take a drink of wine 
 and you know they don't count that really 
 they just
