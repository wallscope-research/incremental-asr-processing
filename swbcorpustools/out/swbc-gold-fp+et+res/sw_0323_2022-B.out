 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 A running total
 Yeah
 we've we've taken how much we have you know write down how much we have coming in each month 
 and then we've 
 at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend 
 We sat dow- made up different accounts like you know 
 we've set a budget for each you know household expenses or food and clothing and entertainment and then our our own fun money and just stuff like that 
 and then we write down each each time we spend something we write down in a book 
 and at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we you know 
 we we try to stay within a certain budget 
 so 
 it takes some it takes some dedication to do it 
 but it it works out real well 
 so 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I stay wi- I have to stay within it 
 so I you know 
 and then we have that you know 
 if you can't stay if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something 
 and some- an unexpected comes up then you're not you know you don't feel it so strapped
 Right 
 yeah 
 because we don't you know we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month
 <> You've got paper under your table
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 To be out of that
 Free
 Yeah 
 the only thing we have it to pay off is our is a automobile loan and our house payment 
 and that's the only thing we ever 
 We try to stay out of debt 
 it's long term 
 We just 
 he ha- you know his retirement plan and then to CODA and stuff like that that's all we 
 and you know we just have our life insurance for right now
 So we don't have any long term you know in stocks or anything like that right now 
 so 
 Yeah 
 that's what we're doing
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 when ever we get enough saved we stick it in a C D for a while 
 and then you know and then when if we need it we wait until it it's expired 
 and then so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 or not 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 That sounds interesting 
 we've never done any- 
 we have 
 you know just our our life insurance guy has come out you know 
 and he's set up you know determined how much we need to you know we need if something were to happen
 Right 
 yeah you know 
 if I would sell the you know 
 if he something would happen to him I wouldn't stay in Texas 
 I would sell the house and move back home you know to my home town 
 and and I wouldn't stay here in Texas 
 so you know I don't know what he would do
 Yeah 
 mine too
 No 
 that's about all for mine
 Nice talking to you too
 Bye bye
