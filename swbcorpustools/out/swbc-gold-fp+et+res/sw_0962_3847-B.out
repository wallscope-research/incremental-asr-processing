 Okay
 no 
 we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time find that it's really a little more economical 
 and we have I find that I have the time 
 and I kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas 
 I used to live in Arizona 
 and it was very con- very frustrating because I didn't have the watering system 
 and it was it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment
 But over here we get enough water automa- you know naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers 
 and so it's a lot more rewarding
 so 
 that's right
 Uh-huh
 Is that enough during the hotter times of the year
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I find that I've been doing a lot of perennial planting which I never did before
 and it's been real enjoyable although I didn't do any this last fall because our past winters have been so cold they'd freeze down 
 and by the time they the flowers would come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting 
 So I was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and and spending too much money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding 
 so I'm going to try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that you know feels 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 those are enjoyable
 did you
 Uh-huh 
 those are nice
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I haven't done much in in bulbs 
 In fact I received as a Christmas present a a planter that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and water it any time and after it started to sprout put in a sunny window 
 and it it just grew like crazy 
 but I don't have any flowers on it 
 I don't know how long that takes or if there's anything I need to do differently 
 It's just nice and green right now 
 no
 I'm thinking White Narcissus or something like a pa- like a white paper flower or so
 And 
 No 
 not really 
 and in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas they have just the the minimum square footage for lots to where you get a little bit of a backyard 
 we have a pool in our backyard 
 and we did plan it to where we have some some play yard left over 
 but it's it's you know very small
 But most of the houses here if you have a pool you don't have anything else in the backyard
 that's about the size of most of them
 So I guess we're kind of fortunate 
 Everyone looks at that with our yar- at our yard with kind of sense of awe like wow you really got you know some grass back there
 Well 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Yeah
 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 That's one part of gardening I haven't tried yet 
 and I don't think this yard is a very
