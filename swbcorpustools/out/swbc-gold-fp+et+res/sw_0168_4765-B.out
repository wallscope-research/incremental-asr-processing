 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure 
 sure 
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 well I guess I I guess I'm probably a little more to toward the other direction
 well I guess mainly because it's I well 
 like there's two sides to it I guess 
 one is that if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever or you know even if it's smoking inhibits you know your ability to function then I I think that that you know I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot 
 but I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business 
 and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that things like drug laws seem to come and go 
 You know we had prohibition for awhile 
 and then we didn't have prohibition 
 you know we've had I guess laws against you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years I guess
 Maybe a little longer
 Yeah 
 So ei- eighty years or so 
 Yeah 
 so I 
 you know it's it's hard to I guess for me to justify what so- seems like you know basically a breach of the First Amen- you know freedom from search and seizure you know on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten 
 who knows
 I mean prohibition certainly didn't last 
 Well but you got to look at prohibition though 
 You had the same problems there right 
 yeah 
 Sure 
 Well it goes back to that again 
 if you look at prohibition I mean because it's illegal it costs more 
 If it was legal 
 I mean face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce
 And clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap 
 and you know you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it
 But yeah 
 get 
 yeah 
 well that's why there's you know people dealing it because there's money in it you know 
 There's ridiculous amounts of money 
 yeah 
 interdiction's hopeless 
 I mean 
 there's no way you're ever going to win that
 The tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up the more incentive there is 
 I mean that's a losing fight 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Well yeah 
 It goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people 
 I mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen
 I don't think you can 
 I mean you know I'm you know was raised with being a very strong Bible work ethic 
 so you know I'm one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people
 So you know yeah 
 I can really relate to 
 yeah 
 everybody ought to do their own share 
 you know I don't have any you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff
 But you know
