 I'm sure 
 well actually probably any government 
 but the federal one's the big one 
 So so what do you what do you think in the short term we should be doing to to improve it
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 yeah 
 I'm getting pretty kind of disgusted with the you know the fact that they're counting a reduced deficit as being some big step 
 Right 
 I mean first of all we were we've already hit the largest deficit this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever 
 and two a deficit is I mean the deficit is only is is as far from a balanced budget 
 you reduce the deficit 
 you you're still not you're still not you're still overspending
 Right 
 I mean it's just the amount that you're overspending 
 and this is you know for some reason the way that the reporting is going on now 
 it seems like like the goal is to reduce the deficit to some you know still outrageous amount 
 Yeah 
 I I I think in the long term something is going to have to be done with sort of the the 
 well I mean it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process right that you've got people you know trying to trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected
 And there isn't any sort of overall accountability 
 and and I don't know 
 I I suppose that that that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're going to have is is is exposure and information 
 And I don't know that in general the American people are that interested you know to listen to to as much you know 
 I mean you're going to have to know what people are doing and you know and how and how how partisan and how and how self-interested their their motives are and and take it to task for it because it's not going to get solved you know if people are still trying you know 
 like you were saying you say you know hey we just you know we just cut defense 
 let me grab some of this money for my state now 
 and then we can throw in some highway bill 
 or you can throw in some you know some other kind of thing 
 and it's a pretty vicious vicious cycle 
 I don't know
 That's 
 yeah 
 that's being batted around 
 I my my dad was always a pro- proponent of that 
 He he felt that that would get people involved who were who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I think I think that that's probably right 
 because in terms of long term you just got to get people 
 I mean at one point at least on a local level going into politics is you know what you're doing is is really trying to serve the community right 
 I mean you don't expect to make any money out of it 
 You know maybe you gain a little bit of local fame 
 but but it's you put in a lot of work in exchange for that
 And I don't have the feeling that national level politicians are are at all like that
 Yeah 
 And you know I think that that that the problem with having you know junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with you know with in- inept politicians or people who don't know how to deal with it
 But on the other hand maybe that's
