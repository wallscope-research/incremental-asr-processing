 You ready
 Okay 
 What have you seen lately
 I'm dying to see that 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 my goodness
 well I am just dying to see it 
 I went to dinner with some friends last weekend 
 and they said get a baby-sitter 
 and we'll all go see REGARDING HENRY
 and I said ooh I want to see it so bad
 Oh
 Yeah 
 my 
 Well let me see 
 Was it 
 well we went to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS last weekend 
 and that may be 
 no 
 right before I went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on 
 we're going to the movies 
 And we won't 
 well she goes all the time 
 but I go maybe once every couple of months
 And when I go I go see two at a time 
 So we went to see SOAPDISH 
 and 
 hysterical 
 We laughed so hard
 it was just you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard 
 Yeah 
 that's the other one that we went to that night 
 And my face hurt so bad from laughing because I love Billy Crystal 
 And course growing up on on the back of a horse you know and being on ranches and stuff so much of that was so true 
 and I was absolutely rolling in the aisles 
 It was so funny 
 Both of them were great
 they are are 
 we just laughed so hard 
 And like I said with CITY SLICK- I mean with SOAPDISH it is so cornball 
 and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know 
 Just they just carried it off to the tee
 No 
 How neat
 Shoot 
 yeah
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I think it is 
 I think it is
 Yeah
 gosh 
 I never laughed 
 And people were just screaming and applauding 
 and you know it was just hysterical
 me too because I don't even know if I could live through it now
 I mean I'm getting around real good 
 and I'm just still real sore
 And today I was I course I went back to work two weeks after 
 but see I don't have permanent work 
 I right now I'm working with a temporary agency 
 And so the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free
 so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants 
 and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed
 And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day 
 And I said yeah 
 and I went 
 and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that 
 And I worked about three days a week ever since two to three days a week 
 And so I went to my doctors last Thursday
 and this was my fourth week checkup 
 and he said well gosh you're just healing really well 
 I just can't get over this 
 He says in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things 
 If you want to play ball you can go play ball 
 He says now I'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball 
 but you can if you want to 
 And you know he was teasing me 
 and he says yeah 
 you'll be out there waterskiing 
 I can just see it now 
 And he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks 
 You've only got two more weeks 
 I said okay fine I I will I will 
 Whatever you call easy I'll do it you know 
 But and I've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it
 And so I don't I'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when I was when I'm still sort of on the sore side
 But 
 well wha- what's your next 
 have you seen ROBIN HOOD yet
 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah

 Well I went 
 course I am a Kevin Costner fan
 Supreme 
 Uh-huh 
 Gosh was that wonderful

 I think he's really good
 I wouldn't think 
 Well my kids are going to their Dad's tomorrow night 
 so I sort of think I may go do that
 Good

 And we went to the
