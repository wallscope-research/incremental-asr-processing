 Right 
 I I kind of agree with that because I think in some cases the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed
 I I think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case
 so a judge you're right should have the whole dossier of the criminal there 
 and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better pri- position to give an appropriate sentencing
 Uh-huh
 In other words not not 
 there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial
 I I I don't 
 th- there's a point on which we don't agree
 I would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a anytime a one of the parties wants one
 And I usually it is the defendant I guess that wants to have the jury hear the case
 So I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we take that you know 
 that would require a change in the Bill of Rights I believe 
 and so 
 okay 
 Right 
 Well I think that's all ready possible
 I think that you can waive the right to a jury trial 
 yeah 
 so I agree that that should be encouraged
 People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial 
 But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to to clients unless they feel they can you know tweak a jury into per- giving a different sentence or possibly if it's a civil case giving higher you know awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the the award 
 Yeah 
 And I suspect it in cases like 
 I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil 
 Is that right
 Yeah
 Well in the case of civil things I think maybe the the use of the jury is very often to the lawyer's advantage 
 and I think that may be where jury use is overdone
 I mean there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently 
 But the lawyers are really 
 it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible
 so I was wondering too if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in in a criminal cases
 I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that 
 But I am in favor of it for criminal cases 
 so there's a difference of my view there for those two 
 Have you ever had to serve jury duty
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 It isn't 
 sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in 
 that would have been about twenty years too 
 just last year 
 and the case I heard was a criminal case 
 and it seemed it really trivial 
 It involved two bicycles
 We didn't do the sentencing 
 The judge did
 So 
 we we a- rendered a verdict 
 and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing
 And that was here in Wisconsin 
 So I I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it
