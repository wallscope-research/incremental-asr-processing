 well h- having 
 sort of the reason we're going through the school system 
 I seem to be younger than most people who who talk on this thing 
 I'm I'm just graduating col- graduating from college 
 I didn't really perceive much of a of a problem with the school system 
 However when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and ad- 
 you can compare just about everyth- thing to Japan 
 and we look like wh- we don't have anything 
 it seems to be not difficult enough for students Not challenging enough And just not generally competitive enough 
 however I if it weren't for our needless competition with Japan I I'd I'd think that that the school systems system works at a pretty good pace
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah
 
 Right 
 well I don't pretend to understand that either 
 but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools 
 But then again I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put because the the dropout rate is in those areas w- 
 it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and and crime 
 And they all seem to go together 
 And it seems like if you could eliminate one of of the parts of that circle whether where you have the dropout rate and crime and you know general poverty kind of conditions that things ought to get better 
 So a- the other two a- a- 
 they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways And clearly to me is a kind of government thing to to fix 
 but it's just like I I don't expect them to know which which which part is best to fix just like I don't know 
 It's it's a complicated issue 
 I I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school
 Well that's I meant when I said the school
 
 Well that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district were well paid
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well it it 
 Right
 Yeah 
 well that's true 
 But tha- there's 
 you can always play games with talking about whoa look at this 
 My tax dollars are paying for this 
 This is wrong 
 But when you're talk- w- w- 
 and there's really not much you can directly do about that 
 I think that that if if there is a problem with the school system from it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well paid That perhaps that might be one area that that could be improved 
 w- 
 you have other professional jobs 
 and th- this is a profession 
 And as a matter of fact it's a pretty big influence on on
