 So Beverly what do you think about drug testing
 Yeah 
 We've we got a lot of mistakes here in the Maryland Baltimore area because of train conductors on drugs 
 I think we've had two terrible accidents here recently 
 and also on just like I bet you within five days a truck where the a dump truck where the driver was high on marijuana 
 I guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath the a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay
 and it would 
 that would tied up traffic for a long time 
 everybody died 
 the fire was terrible 
 it was awful 
 So yeah 
 I think you're right 
 I I think I if it's if you're in a field 
 but then you know who would test all truck drivers you know
 Right 
 yeah
 I think I think looking at athletes being drug tested 
 I don't know 
 even I think the random drug testing I don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs because they're still being caught
 that make sense
 Yeah 
 and then I think 
 Yeah
 I I I think in the long run I think it's it would be good
 I think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know the the test hasn't come down hard on anyone
 I don't I don't know
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Get rid of him
 Right 
 yeah 
 B- 
 Yeah
 Right 
 I I think that that that's a terrible thi- you know 
 it's really funny though 
 I guess my dad was hit by a a drunk driver who was also high when I was probably eighteen my senior year in high school
 and though he's alive today and everything worked out fine it it it happened about two blocks from the high school 
 and a friend came and got me 
 and I was there 
 and I could smell the dope 
 and I could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him
 and nothing ever happened 
 and from from that point on I became so anti drunk driving now I think people should be allowed to drink I think that's an adult responsibility whatever 
 but I really 
 I'm so anti drunk driving 
 and and drugs have long lasting effects
 and I guess when I younger I was probably a little more liberal on the subject
 Yeah 
 but as I've as soon as that happened 
 I guess when I was eighteen years old if you'd have asked me I'd have thought it was fine
 but by the time I was nineteen my opinion had totally changed
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Traction and all that terrible stuff
 Right
 Right 
 yeah 
 I don't think somebody 
 Yeah 
 you don't you don't you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life
 I can't even say you know I wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life 
 You don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
