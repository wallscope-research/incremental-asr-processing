 Okay
 Yes 
 uh-huh
 No 
 unfortunately I haven't 
 I heard it's really good 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 What does 
 is 
 Robby Robin Williams does he have a funny part in it
 how does he do serious
 I've only seen him in funny stuff 
 and so 
 Yeah 
 GARP THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP 
 I didn't read see the the movie 
 I read the book 
 but I 
 Yeah 
 in fact it got some pretty serious deep parts in it 
 so 
 Yeah
 I think the last movie that we went out to see was DANCES WITH WOLVES
 Good 
 we've both seen one 
 Did you cry through it
 It was telling a friend I I said I only cried twice 
 but each was about half an hour long 
 so 
 let's see 
 when I each time that I thought that the Indians were going to get killed I cried
 I cried the first time when the the wagon man got killed when they attacked him
 And I think from there on all the way through the movie 
 Let's see what else did it what other parts 
 I can't remember any of the other parts right off now
 We- 
 I don't remember when the horse got killed
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Unfortunately we don't have any animals 
 so 
 It 
 there was a lot of pretty scenery too in that movie
 What did you think about the buffalo scenes
 That was
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 it's not 
 Uh-huh 
 well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in
 I thought the scenes when the buffalos running though were beautiful 
 like that was great
 And there were so many of them 
 I didn't know that that many buffaloes alive much less in one place
 So that was pretty
 Yeah
 I wonder how they kept up with them though 
 it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast
 I guess they graze though 
 that wouldn't be a problem
 No 
 huh-uh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 I guess they're just not domesticated 
 or or 
 That'll teach them in a couple minutes 
 Well that's funny
 is that five minutes 
 is that 
 Okay 
 I'm not sure
 Okay 
 well I think we're we're we've done okay though
 Well thank you for calling
 And I hope you enjoy some more good movies late-
 Bye bye
