 Hi 
 okay 
 what now what particularly particularly what kind of music do you like
 Yeah
 really
 Well I don't have that I don't have that <> experience to share 
 I I do I do listen to a lot of 
 you know I do I switch the stations a lot because I don't have a cassette player in my car
 however I I do I do like a lot of different forms of music 
 so I switch quite often 
 I think I like 
 I I'm really particular about the type of music that I listen to
 But the 
 there's such a wide selection 
 I think I like a lot I like a little bit of a lot of different types of music 
 You know I I I like music that is that I feel 
 if it is performed correctly or if it's done right or if the version is done right I like it 
 but if if it's not then I won't 
 I I really don't 
 Rap
 Yeah 
 Well I I don't really have anything against rap music 
 I 
 the one thing I do object to about rap music is is when it becomes militant or if it's violence oriented
 I I have strong objections to that 
 actually I listen to 
 one time I remember this was back when even 
 I would say about ten or fifteen years ago I 
 Yeah 
 right 
 when it was just starting I heard what was called talking blues which actually is rap
 And it was about 
 the the piece of music the piece of music was about I think about forty or fifty years old 
 And it was incredible I mean the parallel you know between it and rap
 And you you listen a lot 
 if you if you hear a lot of old gospel especially well the black gospel 
 You know you will you know you can really pick it up I mean
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 they they do they do copy versions they do cover versions of of you know like standards I guess you could call it
 I think it's kind of absurd you know the fact that you know they don't really they don't really give you know the original artist or the original composer the credit that is really due to them
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Jimi Hendrix was the original
 Jimi Hendrix was the original 
 He wrote 
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I don't know 
 it may have it may have been somebody else because I think I think that even Jimi Hendrix did it 
 I think that was a cov- 
 you know come to think of it I think that was a cover version of like a John Lee Hooker song or something
 I mean it was just like 
 it was really old
 I mean I I 
 there are a lot there are so many different songs 
 I mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times I mean I've heard some songs that that I just thought were horrendous cover versions of 
 I'm like you know I I don't want to listen to this Because you know you think of the original is like 
 you know that was really great 
 That was a you know a really good piece of work 
 and then when you hear the cover it's like you know God what are they doing
 I I think a good one was 
 there was a Peter Frampton song
 and then the cover version I think I mean I thought was absolutely it was pitiful 
 Yeah 
 I did too
 Yeah 
 but you know whatever became of Peter Frampton 
 I mean there was nothing 
 he was a phenomenon 
 I me- there was no reason for him to really come into you know great stardom or anything
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I think I think it 
 Yeah 
 I think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer
 man
 Yeah 
 I've I graduated back in seventy-nine 
 so 
 but but I've really 
 I I loved 
 I mean I was I was really into the album oriented music even then
 so I was really familiar with a lot with a lot of of the A O R type music 
 the album oriented like the James Taylor and the the Beatles 
 and you know I mean a lot of people they go they're better than the Beatles 
 and I'm like you know you don't know what you're talking about
 I mean the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles It was just 
 Yeah 
 you just sort of 
 you know well I guess I can just humor them you know At this point
 Yeah 
 but well you know I I I've liked a lot of the new music 
 I think when 
 I saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out back in the mid and early eighties 
 And then I don't know 
 music is kind of in a weird it's in a very weird position right now 
 I think that 
 I mean I like you know things like to hear you know what they call world music Which is you know using all these natural forms of music 
 and 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Paul Simon
 Well you know really that's not world music 
 But what what Paul Simon's doing I think is is is great because he's you know I think I think that using I guess what they call it is eclectic you know drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a synthesis of a new type of music 
 Well world music is 
 a lot of the a lot of where they where they make music that they adapt to a to another kind of to another type of listener
 for example let's say you're taking like an original Brazilian form of music and with a certain style 
 and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for let's say another audience let's say a North American
 And then when they hear it it it's a really it's another form of music and you know sort of trying to draw out the best sources 
 The the best of every type of music
 Because I mean there are some I mean 
 I I li- 
 there are some you know types of heavy metal that I really like 
 but but I wouldn't I wouldn't say that I I completely like heavy metal
 I I think 
 you know and it's the same way with 
 you know world music takes the forms that have really been 
 I guess I 
 you know the best example or you know the cream of the crop I guess you could say 
 and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really that are extremely enjoyable and then taking 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it becomes a kind of music of it's own 
 I mean when you listen to it it's 
 I think that they don't use elec- 
 some of it 
 it's 
 they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably
 so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now and from West Africa that's considered world music because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles
 But they're they're trying to make it somewhat more modern 
 I I I 
 a good another good example was I heard Miles Davis 
 and Miles Davis worked with Robbie Shoncar if you can believe it I mean
 You know he's a jazz performer 
 and then he's playing with Robbie Shoncar 
 who's a very good he's a very good arranger 
 arrangement to 
 we're going to have to get off
 I don't know 
 But 
 Yeah 
 okay 
 but I mean when I heard his album I heard it and it was just incredible
 Yeah 
 I I listened 
 and I heard 
 you know you hear this guitar 
 and then you hear the muted trumpet 
 I 
 me 
 and you never would think that they that they can actually play together 
 but
