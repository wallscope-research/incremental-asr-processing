 I'm ready 
 Well in Atlanta Georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in Patterson California
 this little city is only about eight thousand people
 So 
 Well in Patterson there's 
 it's not a problem here 
 But like I lived in Oakland until just recently
 and Oakland California God they've had like sixty-seven murders so far this year compared to like forty at this time last year
 So it's really bad there
 And and it's all related to drugs it seems like 
 Is that what it's there too
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Like I don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well I I think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands
 and you know then maybe those other people would be kind of scared 
 and they would not do these bad things you know
 Yeah 
 I just don't understand our our laws here 
 Because you know like in other countries man I mean they're really a lot stricter than we are
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I know when I lived in Oakland it was just that like I definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of of the city by myself
 And and then then again some areas I wouldn't go by myself after dark you know
 But down here in Patterson well like I say it's so small that you can go anywhere
 But just like twenty miles away see in Modesto they have those gangs and things over there
 And it it's bad 
 In Sacramento also they have drive by shootings it seems like all the time
 So I don't know
 I just I just don't know what what they can do you know
 I know 
 Yeah 
 I mean like even even going to the grocery store 
 I know we've had this one lady that was attacked you know
 I mean just you just you just don't know what to do anymore you know
 And some of the times it's happening in the daytime too you know 
 so it's not always happening at dark
 So I don't know
