 Well Wayne I've never done any auto repairs myself at all
 I mean I may have screwed in a little screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something 
 but I personally haven't done anything 
 Maybe I've changed win- wiper blades or something 
 but I have noticed since I got married that my husband he hates to do auto repairs 
 but he would rather do them himself than than to pay someone else 
 I guess he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows he knows how to do it 
 and he'll do it 
 So he he hates the time that he takes 
 but he has changed the brakes 
 and he has done all of the tune-ups 
 and the like that 
 and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car 
 I was really impressed with that 
 We had to have it to get the car inspected 
 it wouldn't pass inspection 
 and and so he priced around 
 and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it 
 so he thought well I can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars which he did 
 and then he did it 
 and so I guess he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up 
 what what's your experience been like
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 That makes sense
 yes
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I'm sure it was
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 Well that's exactly the way he feels is that he really hates to spend the time 
 it takes a lot of time 
 if he if he thinks it's going to be two hours it's four if you know whatever it always takes him twice as long 
 But then when he's finished he's he always says well now you owe me three hundred dollars 
 And then he thinks that he has the money that that he can spend on something 
 and he hasn't given it to someone else
 So he gets some satisfaction out of that although generally I think he he does not look forward to or anticipate 
 there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars 
 There's a lot of people 
 and he just isn't one of them
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 No
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 you know that it's really has a bad reputation is to feel that that people in general feel and have have rightly so I think been cheated many times
 and and well I know once when we had a 
 we usually inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our car 
 but once the muffler needed to be changed 
 and he had looked at him himself 
 and but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change 
 he said that's really really good 
 so he went in 
 and but when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something 
 Anyway but the car that the muffler people had my at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further you know 
 they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever
 and so since then I don't think he's ever even seriously considered a you know any kind of job he thought he could do himself 
 But I know from his childhood he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment I guess 
 And so Kelly growing up he he felt like that that was a good way on Saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father
 And so he used they used car repairs kind of as a way to have a you know something that they did together
 and he thought that turned out pretty good because it you know it helped him to understand and be functional now 
 and it helped him to have a close relationship 
 so that's one one way he looked at it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it didn't always work 
 Well I felt I feel like I could myself do some things but that I have enough responsibility that if I have someone like my father when I was living at home and my husband that's willing to do it I go ahead and let them do it 
 I don't feel the need to you know be a feminist on that issue and say I can take care of my own things 
 I'm I'm happy to let them ru- run the cars because I have so many other responsibilities that 
 so I haven't tried to do a lot myself
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 It's a good experience 
 it helps you feel I think comfortable with your car and feel like it's not so scary if your driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might you think well I've I've been under that hood 
 and I know what's going on 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
