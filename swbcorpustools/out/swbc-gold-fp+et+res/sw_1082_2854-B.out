 really
 Huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 What what age child are you thinking in terms of
 No 
 For for yourselves 
 okay
 So you're starting from the b- from the baseline 
 I see 
 Right 
 I have one son
 Well he's he's now eighteen And in in you know has completed a couple of years of university
 I 
 right 
 And and so that 
 but I was working full-time when he was born 
 But I was very lucky because I was a a college professor
 And so I was able to you know 
 and I it was walking distance from from my apartment 
 So I went up there 
 and I sort of left him with with a neighbor
 And I left him in a carry cot when he was very little 
 And I said you know he doesn't need anything except you know look at him if he cries 
 But you know don't pick him up and and this sort of stuff 
 Because I was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half
 And I was able to you know get his schedule just cooperated
 And 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 I'm in Maryland
 But but I was out of the country when my my son was little 
 But but the thing is if you have this flextime and that you might be able to do something similar to what I did Which is you know be there short times 
 and then later on when he was you know 
 I mean this 
 we're talking about I went back to work and or taught some some classes like a week after he was born
 And so 
 Yeah 
 And so that's when I was saying you know don't don't pick him up and stuff 
 But then later what I did was I brought a woman into the house
 And she she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff
 And then I also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing
 And you know in a sense she she carried him around a lot too much you know for for my taste
 It was constantly no I don't want him to explore anything 
 He might he might hurt himself 
 I think it worked out very very well 
 Because what he learned to do by the time he was two or so he would sit next to the desk where I was grading papers or writing lesson plans
 And he had asked for a paper and you know sort of scribble 
 and then he realized that there were quiet times 
 and there were active times
 Oh
 Did you say Romania or Armenia
 okay 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 good
 great
 that's silly 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 I in my opinion it's even than 
 I mean your kids need you 
 No 
 I was in the Middle East
 Right 
 right
 I 
 yeah 
 No 
 I was just going to say I guess my sensitivities are are much more with the you know to be at home 
 Because actually I had my grandmother with me from the time she was from the time she was ninety-two until she died at ninety-seven
 And I mean that was recently after my son was going off 
 And I mean yes 
 in a sense I went to work 
 and she was at home alone some of the time 
 But but still you know it was much better than being shipped to a daycare center You know which is much my feelings on kids and the elderly 
 I think we're t- we're too too much towards it's somebody problem you know 
 I want to work 
 Shove them in in some school for twelve hours a day
 Yeah
 Right 
 right
 And that's sad Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 No 
 I I think that certainly there is a role for this type of help
 And and as long as one can can supervise it and and you know make it work in into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or or or giving it you know the whole job to somebody else to take care of
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Actually there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood 
 Is 
 there seem there are several u- u- m- mothers who stay home
 And they take you know 
 it's probably not completely legal 
 I 
 maybe it's legal up to one or two additional kids
 But and they they take care of another child 
 and I I can actually n- could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this
 And I mean that's another possibility 
 and you know you might want to stay home one year 
 and some other lady might want to stay home for a a few years 
 and 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 No 
 Well actually there was a daycare center where my son did go for a year 
 I think from when he was two to three
 But then he actually started kindergarten at age three
 And so and i- you know it wasn't like prekindergarten 
 it was real kindergarten
 Yeah 
 So he he was ready to to go to school at that point
 But yeah 
 they're they do have such facilities 
 But for the most part th- with the extended family you know you can usually find somebody Which is much like our neighbor you know to sharing responsibility 
 And I'm and also there aren't that many women who who d- who work 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 No 
 no 
 And I didn't mean Israel 
 So you you assumed right 
 Well no 
 because at first thought when I s- you know I said that not many people work I'm I'm thinking well she's going to you know because certainly in Israel the women do work
