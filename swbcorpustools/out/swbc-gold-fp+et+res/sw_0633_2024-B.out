 Wonderful touch tone telephone there
 haven't have I have a wide variety of of hobbies 
 therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide 
 I get a charge out of TEXAS HIGHWAY which is very colorful and not being a native of Texas but being here eleven years have a tendency to find out the about the different areas of the co- of the of the state by reading it
 yeah 
 it's it's absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can set up little trips and day trips and things 
 It's pretty pretty neat <> 
 I like photography magazines 
 I don't take a subscription or anything like that 
 things 
 being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of a lot of building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines 
 and and kind of strange because I it's not unusual to see an engineering manual or something laying around the house 
 and then I'll sit up and read just to refresh you know to keep active on it 
 but 
 How about yourself
 that's great
 Uh-huh
 I bet that would be rather interesting 
 that's self improvement 
 that's that's alwa- well that's kind of a hobby 
 but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing 
 well I hate to 
 yes 
 I do 
 We we have these classes we attend management classes 
 and and they give you books 
 and and the last book matter of fact I read was AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht 
 It talks about who the customer is and being customer oriented which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments
 one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is
 so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is 
 and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer 
 Your my customer I'm your customer sort of thing
 every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of Pat Hagerty and these kind of mind stimulating philosophy type Which all you know betters yourself
 Uh-huh
 Like what for example
 Sure
 Sure 
 How about items like THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER which used to be a big 
 okay
 So those are self improvements
 our supervisor subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW By a man man named Doctor Bittel B I T T E L <> 
 and it's a very layman's approach towards managing different types of people 
 And the very last chapter {A and I haven't figured out why that one was last } is how to manage engineers 
 So it's it's ver- it's interesting 
 here again it's it's casual reading 
 and it's not eaten up with a lot of mechanical stuff 
 and it's really excellent fast reading 
 and but as you say it's it's sometimes it's difficult to to know if it's you know 
 I think if somebody would say hey read these ten books because these are self-improvements I would probably be turned off to them
 If he casually just walked into it and put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested
 Yeah 
 they're quite they're hard to set down because it's so interesting 
 and of course they're all just a little spookier than the movies 
 but it's always they're always challenging to get through one of them 
 I have a hard time finishing books
 Uh-huh 
 In quality especially now days that's almost everything that comes across the the the airways 
 Exactly exactly right
 Yeah we we have I think we we name drop it a little too much and and don't fully understand what what it is we're saying 
 I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk 
 and and all that kind of rolls in together there
 but that's just kind of part of it
 not that I can think of 
 I think I'm under my quota a little bit 
 I need to probably make a phone call or two 
 this is true 
 I've enjoyed it
 Have a good day
 Bye-bye
