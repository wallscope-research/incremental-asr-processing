 Uh-huh
 How do you how is recycling done in your community 
 Is 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Oh
 Right 
 Over here they have several private companies that you can take recycled materials to 
 But if you want to take them all to one place they have the first Saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them off 
 That's what I do 
 and I I recycle aluminum glass newspapers
 So it's nice to have you know one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place 
 and *[[needs slash unit]] Right
 Right 
 So it's so that's nice 
 It would be it would be really nice if they came to the house to pick it up 
 and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that 
 but it didn't go through
 Right 
 I guess what they what they were talking about here was was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something you know
 so I guess that's one option
 I guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too 
 Like 
 have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is
 Yeah 
 I guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle 
 you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler
 Yeah 
 So now they're like marking 
 they're 
 I don't know 
 there's six seven eight different kind of plastics 
 and they they mark on the bottom what kind it is
 So I guess that makes it easy to recycle 
 and then they're they're trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are that are only made out of one kind of plastic 
 so that that makes it easier I guess
 Right
 Where does your friend go to to recycle
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I guess that's how it gets passed on You know when one person you hear from another person 
 and then and then you and then you pass it on
 It seems to be catching on slowly but surely I guess 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Wow 
 that's cute 
 That's neat 
 yeah 
 When you 
 Well when you start early I guess
