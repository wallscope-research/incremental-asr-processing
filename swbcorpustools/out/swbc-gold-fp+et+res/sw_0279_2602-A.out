 Go ahead
 Okay 
 I guess I don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be 
 but I think just the instability of the country right now is sort of scary 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh
 
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I guess that's what concerns me the most Is they're they're so unstable that somebody like that could make decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it looks like it's come close to that as it is
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I haven't
 Uh-huh 
 You mean in the in the most recent conflict
 Yeah 
 definitely 
 I I'm I'm a little bit shocked to what the U S has done in terms of selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years 
 Yeah 
 I think we we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too 
 It's bad enough that the Soviets do it
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons Especially when it's to the south of us
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well I think Russia is getting to the point where they're they're about to do something to get out of communism 
 I guess I'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin to get more power 
 I think Gorbachev has about had his day
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 True <> 
 I don't know 
 I sure wouldn't turn my back on them
 Uh-huh
 At least they're learning a little bit from history 
 I mean
