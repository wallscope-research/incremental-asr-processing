 the only work I do outside the home is I am an Avon representative
 And I sell family products
 And 
 So I I don't really I don't really dress up a whole lot 
 Do you work outside
 uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day I think
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 It's kind of nice to relax a little bit
 Yeah
 Well my my dress up 
 I live out in the country also 
 so what I wear depends on the weather
 so I really I know a lot of the Avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up
 But I mostly dress I try to dress nice but for convenience because when the weather's bad when I go into the home I take off my shoes which I try to wear something easy to take off you know and put on 
 And I don't too often take off my coat even 
 so I really don't have to dress up like y- you would like if you're in an office or something well not actually because we really only have maybe three four months of I'd say warm weather
 Yeah 
 and the rest is gets into the cooler weather
 Uh-huh 
 Course they keep saying the weather's going to change and we're going to have more Florida type weather up here 
 so I don't know 
 But for now But for now we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and cold weather And that type of thing
 Now my daughter works all the time 
 so she dresses 
 I think you know you have to spend more money on your clothing and that because you do have to have the appearance a good appearance to do a good job where you work
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right 
 yeah
 Did you find you wore slacks when you were working full time 
 or did you did they wear more dresses and skirts
 No slacks
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Not even a dressy slack a dressy suit slack suit even if it's all 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 I know my daughter mostly 
 I don't think she ever wears slacks to work 
 But I didn't know if the trend changes you know if 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Look more like a woman 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 well then you you you know why they make them then that way
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 But yet you need to keep up an appearance for your husband too though at home Because that's I I believe 
 you don't think you will 
 Well you'll be excused because considering everything 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 But I I look at homemaking as a job also being a homemaker 
 and I I think sometimes we lose sight of that by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress
