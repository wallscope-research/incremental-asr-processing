 Well have you ever had a family reunion
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 No kidding
 Huh
 Uh-huh 
 that's so neat
 great 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 So so did everybody send in their information and they made a book up about it
 and then you could get it at the reunion
 nice 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Wow 
 That is neat 
 So do you have a big family
 he does 
 Yeah 
 That's kind of how my husband and I are 
 I have a kind of a big family 
 and he just has himself and his brother and his parents
 and that's it 
 So he had to kind of get used to us when we first started going together
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 how nice
 my gosh 
 Yeah
 How funny
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Not be able to do it 
 So did people come like from out of town to the reunion 
 or 
 They did 
 Did you put them up in other peoples houses 
 or did you have hotel rooms 
 or how did you do it
 They did 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 really
 How nice
 And they just brought food with them
 Did they just have like over a weekend 
 Is that how they did it
 Uh-huh
 Well I'm real curious because my family 
 it didn't sound 
 I don't think my family is as big as your husband's 
 I don't think we'd need a whole church 
 but the problem is we are all really scattered around 
 There isn't any one place where most of us live 
 so if we ever had a reunion we'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel 
 I mean you know there would be one person who lived there that would have a house 
 but they couldn't put everybody up 
 So it I think it would get kind of expensive
 Huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 you mean 
 so 
 I see 
 so everybody could stay together 
 Yeah
 a house or something
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 See that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together than if you all were in your own hotels or something
 And then every time you wanted to go eat with somebody you'd probably have to go to out eat or something 
 It would run into a lot of money 
 So 
 That sounds like fun 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 You get a 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That would be great
 That would be really nice 
 Yeah
 That sounds good 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Right
 And you have to sit at a table and just 
 yeah
 Well did you 
 was it hard to decide who to invite and who not to invite 
 I mean did you have to draw a line 
 or did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line
 Like they just 
 whoever wanted to come 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 I see
 There 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Sure
 Sure 
 No that would just be a few
 But how about like because of divorce and stuff like that 
 Like my parents are divorced
 and they are both remarried 
 and you know there I mean there's 
 I don't know
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 So then 
 I I'm kind of like in control over who comes just from my family
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right 
 I see
 I see 
 that's a pretty good idea to do it that way 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right 
 right 
 Well that's a real good idea
 Yeah
 I bet
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 How neat
 Yeah 
 I know that's really neat 
 That's really neat
 I was just thinking of that What you could tell your kids
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 I just 
 the thing is I know a lot of stories 
 but I can't remember who it was about 
 My grandparents told us when I was growing up and even when I was an adult 
 they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their best friends cause they all grew up in New York City 
 but I can't you know I remember these stories 
 but I have no idea who it was that was in those stories
 So I mean I couldn't give an accurate 
 I couldn't tell my kids what you know those people were like 
 I just remember they had some funny stories 
 but I don't know who it was
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
