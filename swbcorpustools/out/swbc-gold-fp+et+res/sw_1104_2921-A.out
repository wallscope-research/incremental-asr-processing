 What part of the country are you in
 you are 
 East or west I'm from Pittsburgh
 *[[listen]] Yeah
 the South Hills area Beaver County well originally Beaver County 
 And where are you from
 okay 
 I know where that is
 Yeah 
 that's pretty out there 
 What well 
 okay 
 yeah 
 I got my brother and my whole family there 
 I'm I'm talking to you from Dallas right now
 Uh-huh 
 No 
 my husband does
 And who how about you
 place that that needed this 
 *[[listen--not sure who's saying what]] Well that's okay 
 I guess it's an easy thing to do 
 So you're f- you have a big 
 do you have a rural house or what do you have
 that's a 
 Those are beautiful
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 is it a is it a working farm 
 or is it 
 More more 
 I can understand that 
 that's probably what I would 
 Yeah
 I can hear the accent now 
 I hear the I hear the Western Pennsylvania 
 We live we lived in Minneapolis for about five years
 We we originally lived in Dallas 
 and we met and got married
 and then actually married in Pittsburgh 
 and that's that's not what they want to hear on this call 
 at any rate we came back here with 
 my husband was transferred around up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T I
 and we're leasing a two story town home in a section of Dallas they call North Dallas
 And it's near a little town called Plano 
 well it's not little any more
 yes 
 that's out near the airport 
 That's about forty-five miles from us
 It's 
 yeah
 That's why we not sure we we're not sure we want to buy down here because we actually we lived up north long enough to appreciate the 
 *[[listen--one utt]] Minneapolis-Saint Paul is very clean
 you know in terms of 
 *[[listen; with previous slash unit]] and in terms of housing down here you really have your pick 
 but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy
 It really is 
 I mean we're we're in a leased town home 
 and it's you're probably your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking it's nine hundred a month
 But you know what 
 if you if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living you know the big apartment complexes
 and and I just have no tolerance for that
 No 
 I pre- *[[slash error]] That's right
 *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 but like the town home we're in I don't know how I mean we 
 *[[2 utts]] this is it's like a duplex 
 like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh
 And it's nice 
 but it's I mean the girl bought it for a hundred and ten
 and now she can't sell it 
 And our neighbors 
 Yeah 
 I mean we'll our neighbors the attached on the other side they're very nice thank God
 they paid fifty-eight for it
 That's how bad it 
 I know
 That's right
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I have some friends that live in Westport 
 and it's really really bad 
 I mean you 
 Uh-huh
 How far where is Clarion County in relation to actually 
 because we're considering moving to Pennsylvania 
 That's not too bad
 That's north
 Are you going up toward 
 I'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an M 
 Bradford no that's too far north
 So you're you're not that far north then 
 okay
 Well you're really not too bad 
 Yeah
 was it a home that you've had for quite a f- few years 
 or that you've 
 then you have 
 yeah 
 Do you have a lot of land 
 or 
 my 
 well then
 There you go 
 Did you have a hard time getting used to 
 do you feel like you live in an isolated area 
 or 
 Yeah 
 I think that that's 
 I can remember in Pittsburgh when 
 this has to do with homes indirectly 
 but I can remember when Upper Saint Clair was out in the you know the rural end of Washington 
 and now it's it's a terrible connection
 well that's okay 
 But but sub- 
 yeah 
 substantially you know 
 do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that
 How big is it 
 How many square feet do you have
 Well how many rooms do you think 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 A junk room 
 yeah 
 I understand 
 we have that too 
 That's that's large if your children aren't at home any more
 That's large if your kids aren't at home any more
 Uh-huh
 It's enough space for two people 
 Yeah
 okay
 Yeah 
 right 
 That's okay 
 Well we've got 
 th- this town house is pretty big 
 It's about eighteen hundred square feet 
 It's got three bedrooms two and a half baths
 it's really nice
 Yeah 
 it is 
 I mean I would never buy it 
 but leasing it is fine
 but it's just again the the privacy you know 
 we had a house in Minneapolis that was on three acres 
 and my husband was raised on a working farm near Dayt-
 right 
 near Dayton Ohio 
 and he said you know 
 he's he's slowly getting me to not feel isolated if we move t- to where there's more land
 Right
 Uh-huh
 That's kind of what like 
 his parents have land that they retired to about a hundred miles out of Atlanta and in Georgia 
 and it is too far south for me
 but but I mean they have one of the 
 when they said log cabin I just laughed 
 that they retired to 
 but they built one of these 
 I mean it's just beautiful
 It's like a custom you know
 it's not like what I would think of when I think of old log cabins 
 You know I mean it's modern 
 it's 
 Right 
 right 
 it's modern 
 it's beautiful 
 it's country
 it's you know 
 but I don't 
 what else about housing except it's well 
 Pittsburgh's housing economy i- i- I think it's holding it's own
 What part what sections are they in
 Yeah 
 that's nice
 Great
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's 
 yeah 
 a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills 
 and they've been in their house probably about twelve years now
 and it's it's you know 
 they're s- going to start to see their return on their investment very soon 
 but it's a beautiful home 
 and I mean my brother lives 
 is it called Baldwin or Bebble
 I mean he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon 
 it's real pretty up there 
 It's just 
 And the neighborhoods are stable you know 
 It's 
 when you come to this part of the country we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing
 my goodness
 Uh-huh
 That's what it is here 
 yeah 
 that's why we're at a point now we've we're adopting 
 and we have been married ten plus years 
 and what happens is you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get <> we'll be staying in 
 So *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 that's kind of like where we're 
 so we're considering Pennsylvania 
 and we're just kind of you know toying with what exactly where we want to be you know
 A lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house 
 and but I disagree with that 
 I 
 Uh-huh
 I know 
 and it and the economy here in Dallas I mean it it's steady 
 but it's still not going up
 And I I just refuse to buy it if I know I'm not going to be there for at least five years you you know 
 I'm sure 
 yeah 
 there I mean you can go down a street 
 and here he told you this every other house you know if it's been foreclosed on or you know even big executives 
 it's really I mean 
 a- and and it's hard to sell the properties 
 People from J C Penney's from New York came here about a couple of years ago
 And they thought they were getting a great deal because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with they call it zero lot lines no property 
 Jean *[[slash errors; why is the name isolated]] And it would make you ill to see this
 I mean it would probably be like your house on you know a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something
 Yeah 
 I know 
 and that's you know like 
 I can look outside right now and look into the next unit
 You know it's across the way 
 and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas
 but it's still it's still not that private
 Yeah 
 but you have a rider
 No 
 and your kids have 
 to tell you the truth I think that if you can keep that that way you know kind of like a homestead
