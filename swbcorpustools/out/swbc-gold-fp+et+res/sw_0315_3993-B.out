 I do tole painting
 Uh-huh 
 I really love the tole painting 
 I haven't done any of the oil or watercolor 
 I would like to learn that someday 
 but right now my passion is tole painting 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 It does 
 it is real time consuming 
 and 
 mostly I have just given them away as gifts
 I've done perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and on and on you know just things like that 
 but I would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job 
 I just work at Stop and Shop out there in in Ogden 
 so 
 No 
 I've wanted to do that but just haven't just haven't mass produced enough to do that
 So I have five children of my own 
 so it's 
 they they keep me busy 
 and tole painting is just a you know something I do in my spare time 
 so 
 Yes 
 uh-huh 
 I have my own saws 
 and so I really enjoy doing that
 I brush it on 
 yeah 
 I haven't tried a a spray varnish 
 I use just a wood sealer
 Yeah
 uh-huh

 Oh
 Now what type of woodworking do you do
 do you 
 Oh
 but it's hard to finish it 
 well that is interesting 
 So what kind of equipment do you have
 Uh-huh
 Boy it sounds like you're really into it 
 That is nice
 Yeah 
 I I just have a scroll saw and a jig saw 
 and I am really anxious to get a band saw and a router 
 Oh
 Yeah 
 that is that makes it easier doesn't it
 Well have you sold any of your furniture 
 or just 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 that's interesting 
 Do you did you take classes to learn how to do that
 Uh-huh
 so yours is mostly just a hobby too then
 Oh
 Well that is interesting 
 I would I really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to 
 I don't know if I necessarily want to do furniture 
 but mostly just do more 
 Uh-huh

 Well they come on 
 we're supposed to talk until they come on and tell us 
 Yeah
 Well it has it has been really fun 
 I've enjoyed this 
 like I say I've made a couple of calls to Texas and just talked to all different kinds of people 
 so I think you'll enjoy doing it
 It's fun

 and it's there by the Copper Mill restaurant used to be the Hayloft
