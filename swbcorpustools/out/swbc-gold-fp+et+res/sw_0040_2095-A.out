 All right have you lived in this area long
 Okay
 Yeah 
 it it it's it's a lot warmer a lot drier too because usually about this time of year this you know you see a little bit more rain 
 I mean by by mid February I mean we start getting a lot of rain
 But it 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 unseasonable 
 I used to my wife and I we used to live in San Antonio couple years ago
 and it was it was I remember the first day of Spring 
 it was so much ice that came down later on that afte- that afternoon and evening
 it was just it was horrible
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well I don't know 
 I I guess I'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather
 I I like it warmer 
 I mean I like it you know I like it warm 
 but it doesn't really matter 
 I mean I'd I would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly 
 but 
 Well I spent three years in Germany 
 so I'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway 
 But I got used to it 
 it was really strange 
 I mean when I when when when we came to San Antonio it was just like you know it just just swelter 
 and then we got used to it 
 and then we went up to Dallas 
 and it was just 
 it's it's not not that it's just hot or dry 
 it's just not very comfortable 
 it just 
 Yeah 
 a little bit
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 my wife and I the last day we were in Florida we my visiting my my parents and my brother and sister 
 we were we were down there 
 and the last day right before we left we had to I had to ride with my sister 
 and the air conditioning went out on the car 
 and we you you just get used to air conditioning all the time
 and this 
 it was just 
 the humidity was like eighty plus eighty percent plus 
 and it was just killing us
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well I mean I I I guess I've been in some places you know where the weather was just so mild you know places like Monterey California or you know 
 just you know so mild 
 and then you've been to such extremes like San Angelo Texas where you just where you walk outside and you sweat 
 you know you're sweating
 you look down at your arm 
 but you see the water leaving your arm 
 it's so hot you just feel it pulling away bizarre
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I tend to agree 
 but I don't know 
 I I think in in some in some respects it probably more tolerable
 No 
 the other topics 
 I got one topic 
 they said talk about the Middle East situ- well
 Well I mean I've had some pretty bad I guess some pretty controversial topics 
 so it's just like well that was my fault 
 But then the weather's like 
 man I mean it gets pretty mundane 
 I mean you can only talk about about the situation just so long
 Okay
 Bye
