 Well we lived 
 I grew up in San Antonio 
 and I was used to the heat 
 and I was used to what couldn't grow down there 
 and we had a small farm house out in Castroville which is just to the west of San Antonio
 and we <> did a lot of gardening out there and mostly in raised beds so we could keep the soil nice because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil very hard to to grow very hard to cultivate 
 and when we came up here to California we're in the Monterrey area 
 and it's very nice sandy soil rich soil 
 and the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow so we've been out here well really in the house since December 
 and we've been planting flowers that we could never plant in San Antonio because the heat would just dry them up after you know about three good weeks of nice weather before the heat started
 and here they are supposed to last year around so we have some really pretty flowers growing 
 and we're at the edge of a forest area so there's a lot of pine mulch 
 Just about anything you would want in Texas as a gardener is here just around us
 We got here at the end of about a four year drought 
 We've had a whole lot of rain 
 it's been raining pretty much continually now off and on maybe one day of break for about a month 
 So 
 Yeah 
 we're getting replenished 
 and so there is 
 when I first came here everything was yellow 
 the grass was dead everywhere 
 And now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful
 and I hope that it holds out here after the summer
 But that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening 
 and that's about the extent of what we've done just a little bit on the patio and waiting for the rain to subside so we can mow 
 We after about a month we finally got to mow this weekend
 But we're just so happy to see green 
 It's just so nice 
 We haven't really done too much else other than that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So do you have to get a shade tolerant grass 
 Is that what you're 
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 Does that last through the summer too
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Just get grass to grow
 Well when we had our house out in Castroville the problem with ours is that the plots there are a third of an acre And trying to keep grass alive during a summer on a piece of ground that big was expensive 
 To water it 
 and and eventually well especially when it was so bad last year well I guess it was the year before now it was so hot that year 
 that was the year that I think it started out a hundred in February
 we were just watering all the time 
 Finally what we did was we said we're going to have to let the back yard die
 It's going to have to do whatever it's going to do because we can't really afford the front yard
 And so when we left you know the back yard had some 
 I think it was Saint Augustine that we had 
 It had held onto a small portion 
 but primarily once the weeds start in the back we were just you know resigned to well the only way we were going to fix this one is that if you plow it all under and put everything back on top of it again 
 But I don't know 
 That's the bad thing there is that we spent so much money 
 or you would spend so much money trying to keep a large lawn alive 
 That was the only thing I didn't like about lawns 
 and we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Arlington area
 Okay 
 Plano 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I imagine 
 So well everybody it seems like everyone is so particular especially in the Dallas area
 There there's so much money 
 and everyone can afford 
 they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn 
 And another thing I've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes 
 the area is so small that they take great pride in being able to use whatever lawn they do have to look really nice
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I know 
 it's awful the first house 
 Our house in Castroville was the first one too 
 And we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening would run into and the time that it took especially when you start mowing 
 and then when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking 
 and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water
 And the one thing that I did notice is that people that have the underground irrigation systems the sprinkler systems just that was the way to go if you could do it 
 People that were building the new homes that put those in that was that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient 
 They would just turn it on 
 and the timer would run 
 and it would water their lawn 
 and they didn't have to worry about it at all
 And that was so nice 
 But we didn't have that luxury 
 so we were dragging th- the sprinkler around everywhere
 And so I hope you can find 
 I don't know what type of grass grows in the real shady areas 
 I remember the guy that was on the radio 
 they had a gardener 
 and he 
 I don't know 
 I had this one well I've still got the book 
 It's I think it's just called TEXAS GARDENING 
 and it talks about the different grasses to use for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas
 But there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant 
 but I don't remember what it is 
 But it's got like a boot on the front of the book
 It's just a real fancy decorated boot 
 It's like TEXAS GARDENING 
 And it talks about you know different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it 
 and it goes into the full gamut of gardening You know everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to how to prune 
 But one of the things I do remember was when it talked about the grass and there being the shade tolerant types of grass 
 and I think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used
 But I don't remem- I don't remember if it was Raleigh and Saint Augustine or or what
 But I do remember they had used a blend
 but that's so neat because so many homes don't have that 
 So you'll be cool all year around 
 in the summer that's great
 It makes the biggest difference when you have the big old trees 
 And the people that moved in next to us they built a new house on the empty lot 
 and they just had their brand new little trees 
 They didn't have any shade 
 They any time they had people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during the day
 So that's great that you have them 
 Are they oaks
 that's even better
