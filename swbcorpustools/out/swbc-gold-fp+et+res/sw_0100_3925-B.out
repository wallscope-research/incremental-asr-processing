 Okay 
 You're asking what my opinion about whether it's possible to have honesty in government 
 Well I suspect that it is possible 
 I think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody
 But other than that I think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty
 Uh-huh
 So they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers
 Right 
 Yeah 
 But I think maybe a lot of them 
 say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves it may be more matter of not what can I steal while in an office but how many friends can I make while I'm in office 
 And you know how good a name can I make for myself and so forth 
 So I guess it would be like anything else
 The president of General Motors probably has the same 
 I think I- I think a little more honesty in the campaigns would be more to the point 
 If you knew what you were getting when you voted 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 they say you get the government you deserve
 Uh-huh 
 It's hard to imagine
 Yeah 
 and it almost seems like in order to avoid some of the scandal you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find on say in the Bobsy twins or something like that 
 So you're taking a government course
 At what 
 The university
 Oh
 Okay 
 You can make laws against corruption 
 But that doesn't eliminate it does it 
 Well they've got laws against cannib- cannibalism but that didn't stop that guy in *[[ seems that a new slash unit should start at the conjunction "but" ]] Milwaukee did it 
 Actually I think other countries may have it worse 
 the Japanese government is always having a some kind of a scandal
 Usually involving the Prime Minister or people very close to him
 So 
 Yeah 
 I've been around to a few other countries 
 and I I I have not found one yet that I would rather live in 
 I think
