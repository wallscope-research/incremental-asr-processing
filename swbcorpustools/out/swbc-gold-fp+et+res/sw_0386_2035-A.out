 Hi Diana
 Have you all been able to do much as a family these days
 Have you all been able to do much as as a full family these days all of you
 Yeah
 Do you work outside the home
 Yeah 
 I don't either 
 it makes it a little bit easier I think that way
 Yeah
 So you have a break too
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 we have family that's far away 
 It sounds like you might too
 Yeah
 Right 
 and phone calls that's about about it
 That's wha- yeah that's what we mostly do pretty simple things
 Especially since my youngest one is excuse me only fourteen months
 She she's really getting to the age where she's playing and likes to go places
 That's right
 that's a big thrill for them
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Have have you ever been to the Science it's called the Science Place
 We ju- we haven't lived here too long 
 and we went there a couple of weeks ago 
 and 
 yeah 
 we 
 I guess there's Science Place One and Science Place Two 
 We've only been in I think it's Science Place Two
 The one we went in had 
 the thing that sticks out most in my mind is that like a kids place area
 That really seem they really seemed to go wild in there
 Where's that
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 that does sound like fun 
 It's a little bit of a ways
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 That's sounds fun too
 And and you said about Plano and Campbell is the petting
 That sounds fun 
 I think maybe we'll try to do that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Because they can just do 
 you don't have to have tokens for everything
 Yeah
 That does sound like fun 
 Well I've gotten some good ideas from you 
 Definitely 
 Well I think I don't know if we've done five minutes 
 but I'm sure that will be good
 It was good talking to you
 I really appreciate your suggestions 
 Okay 
 bye-bye
