 Hello 
 I'm Nola 
 and I'm in Plano
 Yeah 
 now did you push one
 okay
 Okay 
 but I think it's 
 I just started doing this 
 so I don't know too much about it
 okay
 Uh-huh
 That will be fine
 Hi
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well I I I think overall that's right 
 I think it's kind of sad though that for generations they've been taught to hate each other
 And that's i- you know 
 if 
 somewhere in there someone's going to have to learn a different way
 You know an an I I think that <> 
 true we do have completely different ways of looking at things at a lot of things 
 but at the same time I think there are a lot of there is a lot of good that the United States and other countries can do as far as example 
 and and <> I think some different things could come from what's happened than what we expect
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 But that's the type of thing they understand
 They don't understand any other way
 And so at that at that you have to work at their level to an extent too
 They wouldn't have understood anything else than what we did in the war
 There was nothing else 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 I can't figure out why they adored him
 Yes 
 yeah
 Yeah
 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 What's sad is that the leaders that have control are power
 yes 
 and they abuse that
 Which I think that that's not the the way the majority of the people over there really are
 But I think in a in a way the war I think in a way all the involvement over there too though has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing 
 And there are a lot of people who are good people
 You know there's 
 and I I think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the the soldiers leaving you know surrendering and trying to get out of that situation
 And and the you know 
 That's right
 and I I think so much of it is what you're taught
 You know they teach their children in such a way that
