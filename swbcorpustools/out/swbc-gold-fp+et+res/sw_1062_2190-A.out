 go ahead 
 I I am glad to talk to an expert 
 I always wanted to know who an expert was
 well there there's two things 
 the one I'm interested the most I guess myself would be the the Freons I mean for air cond- 
 the one I guess that's the one I'm most curious about is how they're going to replace the Freons in air-conditioning 
 That seemed to be the biggest surprise to me 
 and whether 
 when they replace it you know they're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad
 Yeah 
 I was you know 
 where they were all concerned about that 
 but that that it seems to be 
 No 
 I heard about it though
 Was that before 
 I didn't see it 
 was that before they actually did that 
 or it was w- 
 Because of that you know 
 Right 
 Are you d- 
 you didn't work at T I
 okay
 Where do you work in research 
 or 
 okay
 okay 
 yeah 
 Yeah
 well I'm kind of a car buff myself 
 I was going to ask you another question 
 but I- I'll do that in a minute 
 I I think that the changing you know from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage you know no- not using 
 No 
 no 
 no
 Really 
 I'm a car buff too 
 we ought to wor- talk about that one day 
 I think you can use the you can use high you know the ninety-two percent ninety-two octane I don't think you'll have any trouble
 yeah 
 Yeah
 No 
 I I think 
 I work on my own cars 
 and I don't think that's a problem 
 I thought 
 I'm saying I was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline 
 'n 
 ye- 
 i- 
 the same thing about the war or related to the war on 
 I was watching C N N 
 and I cannot remember what station it was 
 what 
 did you see the advertisements where they talked about nuclear war what that would have been like in changing the atmosphere 
 it is so scary that I hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster you know
 Did you see any of those I 
 it was 
 It must have been channel thirteen 
 I don't recall 
 although I thought it was on C N N 
 I 
 It was a somewhat of a commercial because it c- I saw it regularly 
 and it showed that 
 and it was really devastating 
 and it would 
 how much ash would fall 
 and and how it would essentially literally destroy the world you know
 really 
 yeah 
 there there's probably a lot of natural things 
 Yeah
 it 
 I guess it's got to be really 
 I don't know 
 I don't know if it's air pollution it's it's dust pollution whether it's natural or not I don't know
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well I live in Arlington 
 and there there there are no buses 
 I mean there there is 
 the only school bus the only buses you see are school buses 
 so 
 Well I know it it's you know 
 the car is 
 we have this big romance with the car 
 but I think people are would be interested if you had one I mean
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well you said you were car buff 
 I think that all of us could use one electric car right now I mean today because I think you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever 
 yeah 
 when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car 
 but I think we all could in a family say have an electric car where my one of my daughters or my wife my wife she could use one now if they had one you know because they she don't even she doesn't put fifty miles a day on the car
 No 
 no 
 you're right 
 I I have seen them 
 but they have a battery car
 I went to the auto show this past week 
 and they did not endorse 
 now that I think of it 
 and I was so interested in the auto show I didn't think to ask anybody 
 there were no electric cars 
 I was surprised 
 but now that you just mentioned that 
 Yeah 
 I I think there could be a lot of peo- 
 I thi- 
 people close this is really 
 we're we're nine years away or less I guess from the next century and I think
 Yeah 
 they've got a they've got a area over in the S M building too which is 
 but it's a solar 
 it's for the- g- 
 gots some money from a power company 
 and it's probably more generating power for you know electricity a hundred and twenty volt or whatever
 No 
 I'm actually in the south building 
 but 
 I was I'm the facility 
 so I've been in all most of the buildings anyway
 yeah 
 well the the solar area is right right around from the auditorium now 
 And it 
 they've got several different areas where they're called solar lab 
 It's right there on the first floor you look walk by there
 Yeah 
 but the solar project you know T I's been into it for years 
 and I guess it's just not economical yet because of the other fuels
 Yeah
 I've seen some 
 I think 
 then again I'm surprised now I didn't think they'd asked anybody when I was in the auto show 
 There was nothing 
 and there was no d- place for air pollution or companies or anyone there 
 It was just pure automobiles
 There
 
 I didn't see
 did you go
 Oh
 I was quite impressed with all the cars you know 
 the engines are so much smaller now and everything 
 and they're they all have brand new engines even General Motors 
 very few 
 only the Caprice and them and the Cadillac had eight the old V-eights 
 they're all brand new engines 
 of course they're burning gasoline of course
 Yeah 
 and whether you know 
 that's one way you know f- 
 on air pollution I I I don't know if the automobiles are the biggest contributor or not really 
 They've got catalytic converters 
 everyone seem to have gone to that whether they last and do a good job 
 and now that they the inspection systems are analyzing that 
 well what do you think if you're in that you know if you're concerned about that 
 I mean if you're you're you're knowledgeable on that
