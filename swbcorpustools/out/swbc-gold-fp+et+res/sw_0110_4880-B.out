 Okay 
 Well I'll let you start I guess 
 no 
 I mean I'm not 
 my employer does not do that although I had an ex-employer that 
 the previous job I used to have they 
 after I guess a few years after I had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test
 I I don't know 
 My feeling is that certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb if should somebody be under the influence of drugs I I'd be willing to support that 
 For example well train engineers
 Because it you know like there was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer you know 
 he crashed and killed some people because he was smoking some marijuana
 and I guess air traffic controllers I wouldn't want them to be on drugs And airplane pilots 
 But where it's not necessary in that regard where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property I I'd I would seriously question it 
 so 
 So it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent 
 Yeah 
 Well i- 
 
 Right 
 And 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I agree 
 I mean it's well there's also the issue of 
 o- o- out here I remember hearing a year or so ago that a lot of 
 there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results 
 O- or I shouldn't say high
 I mean several percent 
 Kind of a coarse kind of test
 Is that done 
 Right
 Now l- let me ask you this 
 e- e- at the time you hired on with this company was that prior to any 
 Okay 
 so that this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this
