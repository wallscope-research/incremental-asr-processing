 I'm in a in a ranch 
 A 
 it was about sixteen hundred square feet when I bought it 
 and it's about two thousand square feet now 
 but it's one of those typical ranches that you find around here 
 it's built in the probably built in the late fifties 
 so it's not what you would find where you live 
 But for the older ranch homes it's pretty typical I guess
 Really
 How many square feet do you have
 Four bedrooms
 Five bedrooms
 Uh-huh
 I made a I made a fourth bedroom out of a made a fourth bedroom out of one of our out of our living room and then added a what we call a sunroom to get the you know 
 when when we added four hundred square feet to our house 
 so that 
 How many stories 
 Just one
 How are they built
 Yeah 
 I've heard that 
 I've heard the construction is pretty good on Fox and Jacobs
 But I mean it doesn't give you trouble
 Uh-huh
 No cracked slab or anything like that
 <> All right
 And is it a natural gas and 
 You know what I miss though 
 Basements
 I sur- I sure wish they could build basements in homes in Texas
 So you 
 Can you stand up in it
 So you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here
 Th- 
 ours is pitched so shallow that you don't get much room in the attic
 So five bedrooms and two living two family t- 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time
 You c- 
 Right 
 Some people I mean 
 families seem to migrate towards one one room and carry on most of their activities there 
 and some rooms we have one room that we never use
 I mean might as well not even heat and cool it
 Strange
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Uh-huh
 So you've been fairly happy with it 
 How long have you been in it
 Wow 
 Boy it doesn't seem that long 
 but it is because we came to this area about the same time 
 We've been fifteen fifteen years in the in the house that we're living in
 And we the the principal feature I like about ours is that it's pier and beam
 Yours is a slab I assume
 Yeah 
 ours is a pier and beam which has allowed me to go under it and do a whole lot of different things that I could not have done if it was slab
 I've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that by myself and saved a lot of money that I couldn't have done if the house was on a slab
 But that's because it's so old
 It's thirty-five thirty-six years old when they used to build like that 
 and 
 I know 
 he's not a handy 
 right 
 I on the other hand se- do a lot too much of it 
 and I've gotten good at it which in a in a way is bad because then you you start to take pleasure in it 
 Right 
 My Dad is actually
