 Good morning 
 Yes 
 we do 
 We've got a pickup twice a week that they come out 
 and they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody 
 and they take it
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 <> Oh
 my kids do 
 Put it that way 
 They they've been recycling cans for extra money
 So that's that's been their summer money 
 and they're fixing to go to Disneyland 
 So 
 So 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Really
 Is is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go 
 and they weigh it or whatever 
 and 
 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I was amazed at how many cans that we got 
 because when the kids first went down I said that you know that's great 
 and I was thinking you know maybe I'd help supplement it you know when they turned them in 
 but it's amazing how many cans you go through And how fast they accumulate 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Really
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 we don't e- we don't catch it either mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard 
 So if it mows gets mowed I do it normally
 And I can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it
 It's too heavy
 So I just m- I just mow it and leave it
 It just soaks in
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I like it better doing it 
 Well one 
 it cuts down on my mow time anyway
 and you zip through it quicker
 Proba- we probably will
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Really
 What what makes me sick is is when they show the dump sites you know and and how big they are
 Or like in New York the barges that that go up and down the the river
 and they don't have any place to put it 
 and it just floats in the 
 it's like ugh
 No 
 Yeah 
 It it's it's convenient out here for them to do it 
 They pick up the the plastic the glass and the newspaper
 Uh-huh
 And they will do the alum- 
 No 
 you just put it in the one bin 
 and and I guess they do the sorting 
 But they'll do the aluminum cans too 
 but we don't give them those 
 The kids keep those 
 So 
 Uh-huh 
 Well we don't we don't take the newspaper to begin with When neither one of us are home t- to read it
 So we don't have the newspapers but the the plastic and the glass 
 At first when it first started it it it was hard You know because you're just used to throwing things
 Uh
 It is 
 I know 
 Well the kids have even got to the point where they if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can you know they they're no don't do that 
 and they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain 
 and and then after a couple of days they take them all outside 
 and I put them in a big bag anyway
 and then they dump the bag out 
 and then they crush them 
 So that's their activity thing To go out there and crush 
 So 
 Yeah
 really <>
