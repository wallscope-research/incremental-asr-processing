 So child care your views
 And what religious faith
 that's that's good
 they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes don't they
 And whenever they are they seem to regulate the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good
 Better situations
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's that's very well phrased
 so have you ever used outside child care
 Real day care
 
 our step daughter's ten now
 and most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma
 But quite honestly what I believe to be the best day care situation was while we lived up the Pass of Woodland Park there was ex-school teacher that did a small amount of before school and after school you know kindergartners or half dayers in her home <> 
 and they would read and play
 seem to be 
 yeah 
 and despite our beliefs she was one of the more <> Charismatic Christian faiths
 and it worked out wonderfully
 yeah 
 but I don't know that it would be state approved
 I 
 now I don't know what the current Texas laws are 
 but I but I do know that the license doesn't seem to <> guarantee quality
 now here I believe that child care meets by in large certain standards for balanced food if they provide food cleanliness <> and levels of supervision levels being defined as number of working adults for number of children
 but *[[ I'd definitely call this an incomplete slash unit ]] Yeah 
 *[[ See note on A49 above ]] my wife is agnostic 
 and I'm a backsliding Presbyterian 
 and <> get I really believe that this Charismatic care or the Charismatic belief when emphasized on care or semi Charismatic I might say was quite good
 Yes 
 very
 and and <> the care is what I guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child
 And not have any care
 And I'm not sure that really child care per se should instill any education per se 
 Do you know had a I'm saying
 Proper interface 
 It's just just correctness of of <> social skills if you will
 yeah 
 it's a very broad issue
 And <> you know it's a shame 
 but most people doing child care earn almost no money 
 They operate at you know 
 the owner of the chi- of a you know a large child care facility now 
 we're not talking somebody that does six kids in their home or three or whatever
 Right
 Their employees earn almost nothing
 And that's really really a shame too because <> 
 do you and your husband both work
 Well that's wonderful if if you can make it that way
 Well like I said that's grand if if you can pull it off
 but more and more we're being forced into a situation we as Americans are being forced into a situation where you've got to have
