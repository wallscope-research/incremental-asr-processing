 Go ahead 
 
 Well you should you should have some opinions on that then
 Well I guess if I were going to choose I mean my first consideration would be safety
 My second consideration would be health
 And I guess my third consideration would be warm environment warm personal environment 
 absolutely 
 As a matter of fact I believe that the safety and and health issues depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children
 And it's the most difficult of all for a parent judge because a person can be very nice and warm and loving 
 but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are 
 Maybe the right thing to do is to when a couple has a child then they should both take you say the first four or five years are the most important and I think I would agree with that they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting
 Get rid of all these child care centers at least for young kids below the age of six
 And then and then of course to make up for that the parents would have to work in their later years longer you know 
 in other words they probably would not work may not en- may end up not working at all d- in the twenties 
 But then they have to work from age thirty or or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety
 Right 
 well you know the the world is changing f- from instit- from industrial base to information base 
 and so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work
 All you have to do is have a sharp mind 
 and I believe that mental acuity is easy to sustain maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind
 So I think a person could work into the seventies eighties even nineties for that matter 
 if they didn't have to do a lot of physical labor they could main- maintain
