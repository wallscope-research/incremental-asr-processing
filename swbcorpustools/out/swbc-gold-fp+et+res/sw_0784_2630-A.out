 Okay 
 he did really decide to go
 Uh-huh 
 sure 
 I'm familiar with it
 And he well he must know is he interested in law or medicine 
 he must have a definite profession in mind
 okay
 Medium size 
 aren't they
 Is he excited
 Wow 
 I can 
 I 
 Uh-huh 
 while they're east coast I mean I don't know anything about their football 
 but there you go
 Yeah 
 that's 
 where where you at
 okay 
 I'm in suburban Dallas
 No 
 I don't 
 I have a husband 
 We don't have any kids yet
 About all I can say is I guess about picking schools I guess if you don't know what you're going to do liberal arts program is a good idea
 This is true
 Right 
 the humanities the history yeah
 Right 
 right 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 Yeah 
 but they you know if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school usually a company it will if it's worth it's weight will subsidize
 And 
 Uh-huh
 This this is true
 Yes
 And if you want to go away 
 right
 Right
 Good
 Okay 
 So he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at they'd in Austin Texas University of Texas
 Right
 Texas Aqua- 
 yeah
 Okay 
 well that's I think the other thing is too I know I went to a city high school in Chicago
 and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say my brother and I were 
 and economics was the choice
 sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 University of Penn 
 I'm originally from Pennsylvania 
 Pennsyl- University of Pennsylvania 
 Yeah 
 that's strong 
 I mean that's you know 
 and it's it's well it's a little bit I don't want to use the word wilder that's not the word I want more diverse 
 At Williams or Pennsylvania 
 At Williams 
 At Pennsylvania 
 Well how large is Williams
 Right
 Well that's not bad
 Which is a lot 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's the thing to do 
 I mean I not having any children my husband was an Ohio State person 
 and that has something like either the first or second largest student population like fifty thousand
 Combined 
 Yeah 
 that is too much 
 and I mean I I can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because I spent a year at Bennington in Vermont
 and that was this was twenty years ago 
 Showing my age 
 Yes 
 Oh my God 
 where are you from 
 well let's not talk about that 
 It's in that area 
 I mean I just can't say enough about it
 Well you know my husband's an engineer and a strong a strong liberal arts background with a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say like a a strong business administration degree than with another M B A on top of it
 Uh-huh
 and they usually Yeah 
 but they usually don't 
 Right 
 but they 
 no 
 but who does 
 I mean I think I think all I think the majority of people just don't know 
 No 
 he looked at criteria such as location size of school 
 That's still pretty far though 
 I mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go
 that's not too bad
 Yeah 
 he will enjoy Williams I think and is a good academic
 Uh-huh
 That could very well be 
 and So he's developing his his internal instincts right now 
 That's good because I mean I'm sure what he said was true that you 
 well actually that's one of the reasons I went to 
 Kenyon he we- he made a good choice 
 I went 
 I well I was supposed to 
 but I spent a year in Vermont my freshman year 
 it was just too far away 
 it was too different the level of income of lot of the students 
 and their attitudes was just beyond my in terms of drugs et cetera which I thought was shocking
 Right 
 yeah 
 you're right 
 but then I went 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 And you're going to get a little bit more input than discipline 
 yeah
 Well I don't know how to put this either in this way 
 and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this 
 but I just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today I think the refinement that they get I don't mean specifically or culture but just what you're saying just a solid background because I just don't think at that age I just don't think that young people know what they want to do You know 
 and 
 That's right
 Right 
 Yeah
 This is very very 
 Oh
 They have video lectures 
 Yeah 
 Video lectures 
 This is true 
 and I mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the 
 did he just make the decision today
 How funny 
 That's funny
 It was easy for him to rule out 
 He knew what he didn't want 
 that's exactly 
 yeah 
 Now is your other 
 I mean we're talking about what you think 
 but obviously you're experiencing it 
 Did your other son 
 A clam
 wonderful
 Uh-huh
 The smaller and the 
 And they'll do fine in their studies 
 and I'm sure they'll go on to graduate school 
 [ and + *[[ I think this should be a slash unit since A's next utterance follows B's longer turn]] And now he's a sen- he's a senior 
 *[[ should be an indep slash unit]] or is this early admissions
 So he's So he's yeah 
 well sounds like you have two talented sons
 I think and a lot of people talk about 
 and it's not the economics I solely zeroed in on 
 but I think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return
 and I think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller coll- colleges because of that 
 and I think it's rather sad
 You are wonderful parents 
 No 
 and I agree 
 I mean my husband and I 
 in fact I'm taking my L S A Ts 
 I'm thirty something and taking my L S A Ts on June tenth
 The point being and your sons will learn this from you I'm sure that no matter what age you are you can learn
 and it sounds like they're going to you know they're
