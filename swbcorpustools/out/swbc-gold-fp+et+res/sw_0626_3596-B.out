 about the weather 
 Yeah
 The weather is this time of year has actually been kind of unusual 
 I haven't expected it to be colder until you know 
 like we've gotten the last couple of days
 I don't know 
 I fly for a living 
 and I've 
 the weather's been terribly unusual every where I've been
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well it was around here last night 
 I'll tell you that 
 No kidding
 
 Saturday or Sunday they were saying 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 I know the systems have been real strong out 
 I went through Phoenix on twice on Wednesday morning
 and approaches to low minimum both both times
 and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather 
 so 
 Yes 
 I am
 for Southwest

 Well now I wouldn't call it danger 
 This is this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in 
 This is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the Springtime
 Yeah

 We don't have the turbulence have a little bit of chop 
 but it's not like it is in the spring time
