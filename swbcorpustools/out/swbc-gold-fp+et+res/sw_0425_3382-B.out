 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Have you been following the the progress of the space health code 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think it's pretty exciting that they can 
 it would be interesting to see if they can find other planets that are that will be more habitable to you know humans 
 and yeah 
 I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if if it you know if it is at all possible
 Well I know if they make the advances that they have been making that maybe age will no longer age or even physical abilities may not be a barrier anymore
 Yeah 
 I agree 
 as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to Houston to to you know to visit the space center out there 
 and one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro
 and that vacuum little space program was one of the big you know backers of that
 It's amazing you know 
 you 
 it's hard to imagine what life was like without it now
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I've h- seen him before
 Yeah 
 Yo- we were talking about that just the other day 
 What did we do without it back then
 I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps
 That's right 
 That's right
 Uh-huh 
 That's true
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that that is that is something that would be hard to think about 
 I agree 
 You know like you say we're used to finite things 
 and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible 
 But yeah 
 I would like to see them do more in that area to make space travel more something that the ordinary person can en- enjoy 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 me too 
 I wouldn't even mind being not so much being first but just get out there and and just explore
 I think it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't or experience something you know indifferent
 sure 
 Sure 
 Of course 
 That's true
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Yeah 
 That's right 
 That's right 
 And if you are just content with being you know with the way things are then you know then you must lead lead a pretty dull life
 Because if yo- 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I guess you don't really think about it too much 
 I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff 
 but yo- 
 it it's in a subconscious you know thing 
 You know somewhere they can sit down and write down what you know things that you've improved upon 
 you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list
 But you just don't think about them
 And that's true 
 I think you know 
 we've gotten different programs at work you know to to make it visible to management that we are doing things better
