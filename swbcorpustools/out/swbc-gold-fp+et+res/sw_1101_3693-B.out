 Yes 
 I have a twelve year old 
 and I've been very lucky 
 I haven't needed child care except for my mom 
 So I've been real lucky 
 I'm a nurse 
 I go to school I mean I go to work early 
 so my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for her school or just hangs by while she gets ready
 drives her to school 
 then I'm home to pick her up 
 So I'm very very lucky 
 Well I could do it now
 But she gets lonely in the morning 
 and I feel better 
 she has a crazy father out there somewhere that I just don't let her out of my sight 
 So you never know 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 she feels that way you know 
 and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with 
 but we just feel better doing it this way 
 So I don't know what day we'll stop 
 We we were about to stop one day this year 
 and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats 
 and so we didn't stop 
 And so so you know you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen 
 So even though she's twelve she's still a kid 
 so you got to be careful 
 Yeah 
 I'm I'm glad too 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well I would too because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside
 and I I just don't know what I would do if I had to do that 
 I know the hospital that I work in is a big hospital 
 and they provide child care 
 and of course they charge for it
 but at least all the nurses can leave their children 
 and they're always watching them 
 they can eat lunch with them 
 if they feel sick they can call them at work and they run over and check on them 
 and they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way 
 [ So + *[[slash error]] Yeah 
 *[[aa]] it is nice *[[slash error]] Right right *[[aa; slash error]] Well that's right
 *[[aa]] Yeah 
 right
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Just never know 
 I babysat for the little girl next door for a year or so when her parents first got divorced 
 and it was hard to treat her equally with my child 
 They were the same age 
 and they played together 
 and they were good friends 
 but like you said you tend to go more for the other one's side just because you are responsible 
 and so it it got hard 
 my daughter got jealous 
 and it just wasn't the same as when they were just playing as friends because she had to be there every day
 So I stopped that after a year because it was difficult to balance it 
 so 
 They do 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I know I know *[[slash error]] Yeah
 *[[b]] Yeah 
 well I would rather do without some things *[[slash error]] and I know that some parents they both do have to work 
 *[[sd]] but a lot of people where I live are working just because they want bigger and better 
 and I would never do that
 I never have done it 
 and I just never would do it 
 I would rather do without some things that really aren't very important compared to being with my child when they're growing up 
 So 
 No there isn't 
 there isn't any time 
 that's true
