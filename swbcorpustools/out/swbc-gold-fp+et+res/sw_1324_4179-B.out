 that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs 
 How long have you had it 
 Fourth birthday 
 Does he shed a lot 
 How much does he weigh now 
 Oh 
 
 Is he good with family 
 Yeah 
 I can understand that 
 Uh-huh 
 Well we have a cat who's also about four years old 
 And he's our spoiled child right now too 
 And he also sheds a lot 
 But we we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday 
 But we figure we'll get the kids and then the the dog 
 No 
 but my husband had one when he was growing up
 
 Is is your dog an inside and outdoors 
 
 really 
 when he gets outside does in does he run away and then eventually come back
 
 yeah 
 
 Did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own 
 and 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 
 Really 
 Invisible what 
 No 
 what is that 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Boy 
 I'd be afraid to walk around if I was that dog 
 really 
 
 Yeah 
 just be consistent and diligent with it 
 and 
 Yeah 
 he's indoor and all declawed because I know the average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that and also just getting hit I guess or getting beat up 
 And the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years 
 So 
 Yeah 
 Well it's we just moved recently 
 so now we're in the Dallas area 
 and it's very very nice 
 and
