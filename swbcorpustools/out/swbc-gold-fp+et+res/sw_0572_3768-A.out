 Well what kind of vacations do you like to take 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Where have you gone there
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 well I've been over there too
 I even 
 Let's see 
 mostly Germany and France
 I lived in France for a year and a half 
 so I was able 
 but I once when I had a chance in France to go on vacation instead of travelling around France I went to Germany 
 because I've got relatives there 
 and I just like it there 
 So but Austria I found really pretty and Switzerland 
 yeah 
 and I I lived in the Alps in France 
 so I anything in the mountains over there I just love
 Then I finally made it to England too on my way home 
 I lived in Africa actually 
 and on my way home from there 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 So and you always have to go out fly through or unless you fly from Nairobi you have to fly through Europe on your way home
 So I went to England 
 and I really liked it there too
 I know 
 it's true
 That's the one thing
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 actually now you can get some really good deals flying over 
 but it's 
 once you're there you still have to spend money Unless you know people you know 
 Uh-huh
 That helps a lot
 But 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I haven't 
 I've been I've 
 most of my vacationing in the U S has been on the West Coast
 or this summer I went to Colorado
 and I'd love to go to the East Coast during the Fall 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 I haven't been there anywhere on the East Coast
 I think Tennessee has been the furthest east I've been
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I guess so
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 So the type of vacation you'd like 
 like would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week
 Yeah 
 main- mainly probably because you want to see everything
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I know
 Yeah
 Well I liked it 
 I was working in Cameroon Africa
 and it's not a it's not a place for tourists 
 I mean they're not used to having tourists there 
 so it's 
 you're kind of roughing it 
 But I liked it 
 I liked it
 The people there are just very very friendly 
 and 
 I was working with an organization that does Bible translation
 So I was doing linguistic work actually travelling around finding out about languages and what they call survey work
 Find out where the languages are
 So I travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people
 
 Yeah 
 I enjoyed it 
 So 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 my cousin came over while I was there 
 and she came to Cameroon 
 and then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around you know close to Nairobi in Kenya 
 So she'd always dreamed of doing that too
 So Yeah 
 So is there any place you would try to talk me into going to 
 It sounds like we've been to some of the same places
