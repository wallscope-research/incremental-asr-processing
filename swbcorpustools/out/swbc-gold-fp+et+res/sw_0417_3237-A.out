 Okay 
 so you said that you live in Coppell
 So what is your house like
 well that's neat
 Uh-huh
 is it one you're renting or buying
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 well that's kind of neat that you can even though it's a duplex you can still buy 
 That's good
 Do you have any children
 Yes 
 I have two children 
 and our home is really too small for us right now 
 Yeah
 we moved from an apartment that was really small 
 and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old
 so we moved into this house in Garland 
 it's in one of the older areas of town
 and one thing I really like is it has big trees everywhere
 you know lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty 
 but the the house is real small
 it has less than a thousand square feet
 yeah 
 it's real little
 Yeah 
 and now I have a daughter 
 now my 
 the one that was five months old is seven years old
 and the one I have another one that's three and a half and have all these clothes and toys and stuff that we're just trying to find places to put
 Well they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room you know
 but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet
 so the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom
 but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and 
 you know it's kind of a catch all room 
 But it sure is nice to have it when the kids come over to play 
 they all go out there to play with the Barbies and that kind of stuff 
 so 
 Yeah 
 that works out good
 And I'm thankful I have two girls because they're in bunk beds 
 and so you know they can share a room and make for more space that way
 She's three and a half
 yeah 
 so and right now we have their clothes on like double racks you know in the closet
 we made a higher and a lower
 and it works out fine 
 but they're just about to get too tall where the dresses are beginning to drag you know 
 and we're going to have to figure out a new idea 
 But we're we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home hoping to be able to do that within a year or so
 so that would be nice
 Yeah 
 is Coppell a nice area to live
 Well I think I've heard a lot about Coppell schools that they're real good
 that's neat
 Do you do you hope to have children 
 or are you not planning on having any 
 or 
 I see
 Well do you have any pets
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well do they stay inside 
 or 
 Well that's that's neat
 Yeah
 Well what are the colors in your house
 I bet that's pretty
 Uh-huh
 that's neat 
 I like cows too
 Yeah
 well our house was redo- 
 our house is very old also
 it's like thirty-seven years old
 yeah 
 and it was redone before we moved in which 
 I'm thankful for that 
 but the 
 it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in
 everything is 
 like the carpet's kind of a tan and brown and has paneling in the living room and lots of lots of tans and lots of browns
 but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that
 you know so that's worked out good 
 In the in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan wallpaper had done it up with blues 
 so that's nice 
 but yeah 
 yeah 
 we've enjoyed living here
 It's close to my oldest daughter's school
 and that makes it really handy too
 and she really likes her school 
 so 
 and we are so close to shopping 
 and 
 Yeah 
 how about in Coppell 
 I've always imagined it kind of out away from everything
 really
 well that's nice
 wow
 Oh
 Yeah 
 yeah
 but it does sound like it's definitely growing
 Yeah
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I see
 Well when we first moved here we moved here from Lubbock
 and we almost moved to Lewisville 
 that was our second choice yeah behind Garland 
 we at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home
