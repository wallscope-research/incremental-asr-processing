 Okay 
 Gene 
 So it's nice to talk with you 
 and food is a very intriguing thing 
 Our lives are are built around foods that we like and an- nutritionally good for us
 What kind of dining out do you like
 Oh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Pancho's that's a new one
 Uh-huh 
 We have one called Chi Chi's in th- in our area
 And we had a restaurant called La Bamba 
 but it's just it closed recently 
 But Chi Chi's is a national restaurant I think 
 Isn't it Mexican
 Do you have it there
 Uh-huh 
 Well I love Mexican food myself
 But you go ahead now 
 Is that right 
 Uh-huh
 boy that is wonderful
 Well I I agree with you on that 
 And I wa- was really a seafood addict myself 
 I I love crab meat in particular
 I I can almost live on on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if I had to
 I know the name 
 but I haven't been there
 Uh-huh 
 Where did you go to college
 the U S Naval Academy
 Uh-huh
 I'll be darn
 Well we're we're supposed to be talking about dinning out 
 but I'll just make one comment that I just retired from Penn State 
 and all my work has been in research for the Navy 
 Underwater acoustics
 I have dealt with nearly all of the all of the research laboratories that the country has
 Uh-huh
 you grew up in Orlando 
 Uh-huh
 Well that's what I worked on
 The end of last month
 I certainly have 
 So wa- I hate to 
 I wish I could talk to you about that 
 but I guess we should continue on 
 Okay
 How do you like Chinese food
 Uh-huh 
 Well I enjoy the Szechuan type of Chinese food
 Yes
 Yep 
 it's 
 I I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself 
 I have in the past 
 I haven't done recently 
 but it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals
 just at home
 I I enjoyed the food 
 and I bought a lot of good cookbooks 
 and I've been following through on that 
 When you find the right cookbook why it works out
 Okay 
 well that one's a good question 
 Here it's right under my nose if I can find it 
 boy
 Yeah 
 right 
 One of th- th- this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY 
 it's a paperback 
 and I think it's by someone named Chang 
 Yeah 
 Isabelle Chang
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I think you will enjoy that
 Well it certainly is nice talking with you Gene 
 And what is your phone at home
