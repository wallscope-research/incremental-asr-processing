 not very many of those at 
 sometimes I I play the trumpet 
 and sometimes I work on trumpet mouthpieces
 And then I have a five year old daughter 
 and we cut out things kind of you know and color and and use markers and things like that
 how about you
 Uh-huh
 
 Yeah 
 exactly
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I don't know 
 My my father is in the in the antique business
 And he he goes around to garage sales 
 and he buys all kinds of china and figurines and statues and stuff 
 And there's some stuff that's really for auto repair 
 It's called J B Weld
 and I repaired a a gasoline tank with it once 
 But he mixes colors in it 
 It's an epoxy resin that you mix together
 And he makes like 
 the other day he was working on a hand that was shattered on a a statue that's real small 
 it's like about maybe 
 the hand's about the size of a cricket And has like the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking out 
 and he was repairing that 
 and it came out pretty good 
 It's kind of a kind of a ivory color all over and and has some age spots in it 
 and it looked you know just like it it had been there all the time
 And he fixed some fixes some bowls that have the cracks or chips in them and molds that in 
 He had a blue blue bowl a few weeks ago that he he fixed that way
 It worked out real well too 
 And then And and then he he thatches you know those thatched chairs
 Course that's like that that hooking that you were talking about
 That takes a lot of time
 Yeah 
 And he used to paint a long time ago 
 but I think he's stopped pretty much now
 But outside of outside of art class in in school I I stopped doing most of that unless I I mean like he has a computer 
 and I use the graphics software on that <> to to do figures and to look at things you know see how they work
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 sometimes 
 but it's not one of my favorite things especially from the vapors 
 and we had an entertainment center we did last year 
 we bought it at an unfinished furniture place and sanded it down and stained it and then lacquered over it 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 sure is 
 Did you use a did you use a Zar stain
 <> they had a 
 well I saw the commercial on T V 
 and they 
 and and the people at the unfinished store recommended it 
 that's called 
 it's Z A R <>
 And it spreads real evenly 
 and it doesn't dry too fast 
 so it's 
 if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out
 And we put we put tung oil on it 
 Kind of made it sticky for a while 
 But after it dried out it was you know it was real hard 
 and it was all right
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Were you in a were you the Girl Scouts too 
 or 
 Well it was nice talking to you
 Okay 
 you too
 Bye-bye
