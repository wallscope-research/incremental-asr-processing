 Yeah 
 is that like Visa and and Mastercard
 Do you have department store credit cards too 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Appliances
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right 
 My my husband and I do basically the same thing 
 but we we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise us
 We still pay it off every month if it kills us 
 But we do it mainly for you know the cash flow 
 what is that float 
 That's the word float
 And I often will keep tra- track of what I've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook already
 And sometimes just 
 and keep a list and make sure I I don't go over a certain limit Especially around birthdays you know
 Oh
 If we go out to a restaurant just to float it 
 or I don't know
 Yeah
 Yes 
 my husband has a a 
 Or anytime like a plane ticket or you know 
 Even if we have the 
 I'm sure we'd have the cash before we got it 
 but the float for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for that That thirty days or whatever
 We have a new one from A T AND T 
 and we have you know haven't used that one too much 
 Be interesting 
 that's nice because you can use it for a calling card also
 It's a Mastercard too 
 so 
 It's kind of fun 
 but you get a lot of junk mail about them
 Yeah 
 you're such a a wonderful person 
 We'll give you five thousand dollars up front 
 Right 
 Do you have an annual fee on yours 
 or do you get yours through a bank 
 or 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I I can't see paying an annual fee for it 
 I mean I almost 
 Yeah
 Well it sounds like I'm being paged otherwise
 So 
 Good talking to you
