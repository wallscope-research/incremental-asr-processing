 That's okay 
 I didn't hear
 Okay
 Okay
 You heard her in the background 
 That's babies
 Takes a lot of time 
 I like most sports 
 I like to do that 
 I kind of like to do a little bit of sewing
 little bit of embroidery work once in a while
 What do you like to do
 Well I'm sure you probably are
 You like it 
 that's the main 
 That's right
 boy that's hard sewing
 Measure it and get it to 
 Well if it it depends on how elaborate you get it 
 If you get pleats and all kinds of 
 That's a lot of work
 Oh
 Right 
 right
 That feels really good
 To do it 
 right
 Keeping fish 
 Well they're probably easier than keeping dogs though aren't they
 no
 How much that bothers you 
 and you probably have to clean out the tank too
 no
 you're kidding
 because they need to have a little bit of the 
 I see
 no
 And so you'd have to start all over to build that up probably
 Right 
 right
 Don't go through the whole nine yards 
 and they kind of need a little bit of that
 So you've had fish for a long time
 What size do you have now
 that's a good size
 Have you ever had it crack or break or leak
 Fifty-five gallons you'd hope it would never do that
 Do you have all kinds of different fish 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Real exotic 
 Well they're probably hardy harder to take care of 
 and 
 Yes 
 I bet it is
 Do you have problems with them the fish eating each other
 Right
 Then you have to 
 how do you isolate them
 A jar or something 
 or 
 Okay
 Okay
 Okay
 Oh
 Right
 It'll go through the slot
 That works all right then 
 They don't want the mothers to be with the little fish either
 They will
 Isn't that odd
 You wouldn't think that
 You're kidding
 And that just makes you sick almost doesn't it
 Things are different in the animal kingdom 
 Yeah
 That's kind of the way they do it
 Survival of the fittest or something
 Right
 Go hide from them 
 well and then you think well how did they do it out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are kind of trying to keep up with that 
 but If you're like me you never have enough time for the hobbies
