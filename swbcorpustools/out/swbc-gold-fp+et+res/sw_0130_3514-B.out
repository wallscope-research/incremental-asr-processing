 Right 
 so well what kind of vacations do you like
 Uh-huh
 that's great
 Uh-huh
 no actually
 Why have you 
 okay 
 No 
 I have been to Europe once and to Haiti and 
 Yeah
 No 
 no 
 Haiti
 Right
 It's well it's in the Caribbean 
 and it's the western half of an island 
 with the eastern half that's the Dominican Republic
 And I was down there with a program from the college that I went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country most of them third world countries And study the language and then do a little service project
 So yeah 
 that turned out to be a really good experience for me
 well see I went there when I was in high school actually
 and I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and hung out with them worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp
 well not that much 
 Just 
 Right 
 I mean I wasn't a great asset to them or anything 
 But I you know drove a tractor helped them weed beets and that sort of thing
 And yep 
 and I went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home 
 and that was pretty interesting 
 And while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who were staying for their vacation in France in Nantes which is on the west coast like right across from England
 so where in France are you
 Right 
 Paris
 And how long do you plan to be going for
 Uh-huh
 Great 
 And 
 A what
 great
 And what else are you planning to do if anything
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 actually no 
 I don't think I went to any of them 
 the closest thing I did was go to some like restored castles and stuff
 That there is some on that west coast of France 
 and I went to a vineyard or two in Germany
 Yeah 
 that was nice 
 but so 
 no 
 I haven't
 Have you
 Okay 
 Well well 
 Where have you gone first 
 Yeah 
 I mean
