 Okay Lee 
 Tell me about your ideas on this the U S government supporting health insurance and so forth
 Well what is this going to do the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing a good job
 Yes
 Well this is what's bothering me Lee another question 
 do you think that there should be some control innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously over priced things 
 We realize that for the individual person some things are very important 
 matter of fact in some respects their life might depend on it
 But by the same token some of these charges they make for well minor endeavors shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line
 There should be some control of that 
 Yes 
 and that is what is giving the local insurance companies hard times 
 That is the one thing we have no control over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals 
 and you get something done 
 and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it
 Yes
 We have had several of them 
 My wife and I both have had that recently
 Yeah
 See that that bothers me about the government see 
 my 
 Do you think that that these insurance things should be covered on a State basis or U S government basis
