 Our most recent series of projects I guess was inside was we remodeled a bathroom recently
 Well it went pretty well other than the fact that we encountered some problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing which one thing led to another 
 and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain Which meant you needed to take the wall out and start all over
 It wasn't one of those 
 it started out as a Sunday project
 and by by the next Sunday it was done 
 It wasn't a one dayer 
 Believe me
 Yeah 
 it's good for another thirty years
 Yes
 Well that's the thing that surprised me because once I got into the plumbing everything in there was copper 
 and it was all soldered
 That's what drove me bananas because you know I'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and and cement to fit them together 
 and nothing wanted to go 
 so it was like I had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over
 Really
 That was an all day job just to get it plumbed
 Fortunately I was very fortunate in the fact that when I made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked 
 everything worked 
 And I just said that's marvelous 
 I appreciate it
 Well I expected something to leak you know left a fitting loose or didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that
 But it all came together 
 so I I felt pretty fortunate about that
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 What kind of paint
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that and semigloss for trim work and usually flat for walls
 Was it not washable paint
 Uh-huh
 What color is it
 Pink 
 okay
 Did you require more than one can of paint
 You didn't have to mix paint then right
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 But you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with
 How'd that go
 Kind of fun isn't it 
 Really
 Repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you when you buy your paper
 Yeah
 Normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats
 Yeah
 
 When you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall
 Or did you start at the edge
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I've had my best luck in papering when I start in the middle of a wall 
 and I'll start with a plumb line And start in the middle of the wall and and go from there and go all the way around the room
 Well you you
