 I have children that are in the Plano Public School systems 
 and I am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school system 
 So 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Well I think the public school systems are doing a good job 
 I think they have a long way to go yet 
 but I think that they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier 
 You know my kindergartners were on the were on the computers 
 and I think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done 
 And I think that the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them you know skills 
 You know you don't just add one plus one 
 you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together 
 And I think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think 
 they literally cannot come in out of the rain
 You know and that just 
 I don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted
 And this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why I went into education 
 So I think you know they're they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have 
 and I think that's very very important
 yeah
 yeah 
 I tutor a girl that's in eighth grade 
 and her pre-algebra book is higher then some of my Algebra Two when I was in high school
 And it's like I going to take this home and study it before I can help you
 You know so they're really they're really moving them along 
 but yet at the same time you know they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life
 And that's wha- you know 
 a lot of the things that we did in school I've never used and never will use
 And so I think that it's it's appropriate to teach them you know why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this
 Yes 
 that's a 
 Well filling out the forms and also all of these statewide and national wide testing things so that they compare 
 and You know you can as far as I'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say
 And it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it 
 And you waste so much time quote unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be you know that I think it's I think it's crazy personally 
 You know the fir- the whole first nine weeks of school is is used as a review 
 but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in October So that you know your school district shines throughout the United States 
 And I think that's totally useless 
 I think you know there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons 
 but I think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous 
 It's like bragging on your grandchildren
 You know and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth 
 and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this 
 and that's great 
 But that's what they're doing with the school systems 
 and they're wasting too much time on that I think 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yes
 Yeah 
 there's a 
 yeah
 The bottom line is always money
