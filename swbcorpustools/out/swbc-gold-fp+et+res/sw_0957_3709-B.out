 All right 
 exercise 
 as a matter fact I work out in the mornings 
 I belong to Presidents
 And I have got a routine for every morning of the week 
 and I don't work out on Saturday or Sunday
 but I do I do a combination of running and weight training 
 No 
 I actually I just joined on my own 
 and I have been thinking about getting with a one of their counselors just so see what they might have to offer as far as alternatives 
 But I pretty much worked on my own routine
 They have got the track on the inside
 And I run one mile on Monday Wednesdays and Fridays 
 and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays I run two miles
 And then after that I work out with weights
 I work out with free weights
 yeah 
 It is really the aerobic work out part
 about seven minutes
 no 
 I do 
 Yeah 
 that is that is a pretty good clip 
 and I am pretty winded by the time I get done
 So 
 yeah 
 I I could probably go faster 
 but then I would wear myself out 
 And I wouldn't be able to work out anything else
 Yeah 
 How about you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 I see 
 So this 
 do you just try and keep them I guess firm and 
 Yeah 
 that is true 
 Yeah
 I see
 I see 
 so you are in in part of a band
 I see 
 I see 
 I use to play an instrument when I was in high school 
 but it wasn't the trumpet 
 So I was just wandering if that was what it was or something 
 I think 
 So do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I use to do a little bit of jumping rope when I was 
 well a while back I was more into basketball
 and I could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves
 And but it has been a while since I have done that
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I that is true 
 I have noticed that 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 That is interesting though 
 I have been thinking of changing 
 I have done the same routine for almost two years now 
 and I am thinking of changing it up
 that is why well you know I was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to get out of the routine
 Because I have heard that you know you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing
 So I am looking at changing things a little bit
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
