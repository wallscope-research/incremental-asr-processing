 I've kind of gotten out of the habit of doing this 
 It's been down this weekend
 In the school systems
 That's right 
 What school system does he go to
 Okay
 Okay 
 my children go to Garland 
 and I teach in Dallas
 And my husband teaches with Plano In the what
 Well yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah
 No 
 no 
 they're still in elementary
 So yeah
 Uh-huh
 I'm definitely not 
 are you kidding 
 No 
 No 
 I want that 
 I think it would be better for the teachers and for the children because we would do away with so much of the burn-out that we have 
 I know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school then it's like they've lost so much ground we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up reteaching what they had the year before You know
 Well we're starting pilot schools 
 It's a- 
 Dallas is doing it I know 
 I think Plano don't they have some 
 and Richardson's supposed to start some pilot schools going to school year around
 And then we you know we investigated this by flying some people out from Dallas to observe some of the schools in California that already had it
 Yeah 
 it seems to 
 and one thing it'll save us money because we've got the buildings sitting there 
 right 
 and we might as well use them
 Well air conditioning what's and and heating
 Isn't air conditioning less than heating because we have to just up 
 like if we get in the thirties we raise it up to the seventies 
 right 
 that's forty degrees
 Isn't it less
 And it's not like the kids are going to go a lot longer 
 really if you go year around there's not thirty days difference
 There's different ways to do it 
 Like I I think going two six weeks and then having two two weeks off each after a two six weeks period is one way
 See I don't know because I've never seen it in action
 No 
 the school system in Dallas has sent people there to do that 
 No
 But I think I'd like it 
 and I know a lot of teachers that would like to try it
 The principal's their t- hands are tied by all the administrators 
 and I heard that in Dallas it's one out of every three is actually in the classroom of the educators that were hired 
 It's just 
 you don't even know who all your bosses are 
 It's ridiculous
 Marvin Edwards
 Well you know he did supposedly cut administrators 
 but what they've done is create other offices for those same people and just rehi- renamed their jobs and you know opened up n- other n- other things 
 One thing we've got going is called reading and initiative 
 and they've hired all these administrators in on that you know
 Pass or no fail what is it
 No play
 No play
 Carter High School
 Yeah
 And all the things that Dallas fights costs thousands probably millions of dollars I bet you
 Yeah 
 I know
 And psychologists and stuff
 That's right
 No 
 we do not 
 No 
 We need more of the tax money to actually get down to the students because it's pretty frustrating when you see you don't even have paper 
 and you're trying to ration it you know 
 now that's sad when there's supposed to be what you know one thousand what sixty-five dollars something like that spent on each pupil
 it's it's wrong 
 Anyway I was thinking about 
 one thing that's wrong with schools is that we're not teaching to the children's modalities 
 and I think in nineteen ninety-three we're supposed to begin that 
 If if a child is a visual learner we're supposed to present him with all these visual things 
 and if he has to learn just by kinesthetic we're supposed to teach whatever way that that child has to have it learns the best way 
 And that's going to be quite a problem
 But if we could do something like that I'm sure it would certainly help
 I don't know 
 no telling 
 I don't know 
 And you know at nongraded schools 
 They've had one in Gladewater for years and years and years 
 If we could just let these kids go at their own rate 
 I have children even 
 I I teach Chapter One 
 and it's for kids that have fallen behind in their reading according to like I T B S scores
 And some of the kids really they shouldn't be in there 
 and they're you know they're not being challenged 
 and they're not being challenged in their home 
 and we always have to teach toward the middle of the road
 Uh-huh
 Right
 My children's parents aren't even there at night most of the time to do anything with them
 Yeah
 I know it 
 I know it 
 I went for a couple 
 and I didn't know that there was even a cut off or anything 
 another things that's wrong with schools 
 this is big 
 there's too much emphasis on test 
 We're spending the first hour of every day teaching for the test at my school 
 and we're going to do that until at least the first part of May
 But see they're not in Dallas
 Yeah 
 we're not working with the same type of students that most of these kids in Garland are
 But see what we're doing is we're turning these kids off to school even more than they are
 And we're not teaching toward the test 
 we're teaching you know 
 I always objected you know 
 it's like there's not a whole lot of you know fun time like we used to have in school 
 Like our principal says I want every child to be on task all the time
 And you can't do that as adults 
 But we're expecting kids to 
 And like after after recess play 
 we don't get that 
 Okay
 If they finish before their thirty minutes is up then they can go out and play for like maybe five or ten minutes probably be the most
 But we always got that 
 didn't you 
 <> Yeah
