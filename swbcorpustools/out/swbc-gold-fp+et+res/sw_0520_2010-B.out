 Hi Archie 
 I'm Sharon
 Yeah 
 I've seen that 
 that's that was a really good movie 
 Probably one of the best things about it was the scenery 
 and I thought the story was pretty good too 
 I I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it
 No 
 I haven't
 I've visited the Wyoming area 
 I'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH WOLVES was filmed
 Could be 
 I n- I haven't been to South Dakota 
 Have have you been up to that
 Oh
 Okay
 Terrain
 Really 
 That's true
 I agree with that 
 I I noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it 
 I think it's been nominated for twelve awards 
 and and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud 
 So it it has surprised everybody
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Did you
 Have you seen SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY
 Y- you have to go see that one 
 And how about SILENCE OF THE LAMB
 Go
 I do 
 I go every weekend 
 I I 
 those are two definite must see movies I think
 It's suspenseful 
 I don't think it's very t- 
 I mean there's not really any blood and guts in it or anything like that 
 It's it's more suspense 
 the other one SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody's not into that kind of stuff 
 It's it's pretty graphic at points 
 But I think they're both excellent movies
 No Huh-uh
 *[[two utts]] Yeah 
 Somebody in South Carolina told me about him
 Yeah
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 I think that I think he really 
 his heart was in it 
 but I I don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was 
 I think it was something that he really wanted to do 
 He wanted to direct it 
 he wanted to to star in it 
 You know he he enjoyed the story line 
 and I think he just really w- he really wanted it 
 And whether it whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office I think he would have been happy 
 Because I think that I think he did a good job 
 and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him
 
 Yeah 
 Who 
 no 
 I don't know who that guy is
 he does
 As a recurring character every week
 Oh
 No
 now see I'd I'd a never put those two together
 Huh-uh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 real scruffy looking 
 Yeah
 You think so 
 I mean I haven't been watching my watch 
 I guess 
 yeah 
 Does it usually cut off 
 Is that what it does
 It used to it used to just automatically cut off 
 but it says when the conversation is over just say your good-byes and hang up 
 So I I guess so 
 Okay
 Good talking to you Archie
