 I guess I'm going to school while I'm working at T I 
 so there's not a whole a lot of time that I've got for hobbies it seems like lately 
 But one of the things that I do when I've got some spare time is I do some woodworking 
 And that I guess ranges anywhere from carpentry work to some types of furniture and I don't know what you would call them knickknacks I guess stuff you hang on the wall to put a mirror on 
 and I made some candle sconces that you hang on the 
 There's something about working with wood that that I enjoy that 
 I don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood 
 but 
 Yeah 
 because it's it's out there 
 You know I don't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when I track in saw dust 
 and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that 
 but then I get the opportunity to vacuum 
 so I guess I get some of both 
 What are some of your things you like to do
 Yeah
 yeah
 Yeah 
 it's a good time for gardening
 I could do with a little less wind 
 but I think the the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside
 Do you find you do most of your your crocheting or your knit work around Christmas time
 Yeah
 Well that's kind of what my wife says 
 She enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something to cover her her legs and feet with while she is working on it
 I know it seems like she 
 I think she made three this year one for my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters 
 So those things they take some time to make
 Well that's kind of like quilting
 I think tha- 
 Mile a Minute
 Well I'm not sure what she does 
 I I 
 first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across you know back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of of afghan 
 I guess that is your standard knitting isn't it
 Yeah 
 I know
 okay
 Instead of call waiting or call anything else
 Well I guess that's that's one way to end a conversation
 Yeah 
 What 
 have you started your garden yet
 boy
 yeah 
 always got to have those
 I think I had four jalapeno plants last year 
 I think one of them died 
 but I I've got s- I've put them I chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because I there is no way that I can eat all of those 
 nobody else in the family likes them 
 but always got to the keep those planted
 Well that's kind of the way I am 
 I planted zucchini last year 
 I planted four hills of them 
 I think I had three or four seeds in each one of them 
 and those things just flat took over 
 it wasn't until late I guess in the summer 
 maybe it was because it was too dry 
 they finally started making zucchini 
 and I'm not sure when a good time to plant those is if they should be planted early or later 
 It seems like all I got was 
 I would think so 
 seems like these all they all went to to leaf 
 and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit 
 So I don't know if I 
 Mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon You know 
 but I don't I hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is
 It may not be 
 it may not be
 You think they're later in the year
 
 Well that's true 
 Most of the okra that is growing around higher is is later okra
 Well that's about 
 Go ahead
 Well I was just going to say it's a little over six or seven minutes 
 So whenever you feel comfortable about concluding well I'm 
 that would be fine
 Well all right 
 I guess we'll call this one quits 
 an and thanks for participating 
 All right 
 have a good time
 Bye
