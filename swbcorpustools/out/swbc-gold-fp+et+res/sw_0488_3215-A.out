 Well this is a subject that you never think you'll be assigned to One that kind of comes up when you've lost it the others other subjects 
 as I was sitting there I thought the weather's been perfect 
 I don't know much to say about it 
 It's it's you know 
 for the balloon festival here in Plano it was just gorgeous
 Are you 
 It couldn't have been better
 I mean it didn't foul one launch 
 and that's kind of unusual 
 and it's kind of cold in the mornings 
 so you dress up warm 
 but by 
 That's the only thing wrong I can find with it
 how fun
 I miss that 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Ooh
 I guess you have to take some things and leave some things
 Yeah 
 I'm from Utah area 
 and they you know they have tons of canyons where the leaves change 
 and they're gorgeous
 you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area
 Yeah 
 it's kind of hazardous for driving 
 that's for sure 
 But I can't complain 
 I don't know if I've been spoiled 
 I've been thinking it's getting cold sooner than normal 
 We've only lived here a couple of years
 
 We'll have to see how it goes 
 a couple of weeks ago we were cooler than normal 
 but then we're back to being warmer than normal this week or last week 
 so 
 I don't have to live through many any of those really 
 a bad 
 I mean nothing comparable I guess to what you've had before
 You're right
 Well they get ice 
 and no one can drive on ice
 I mean we used to think they were pansies 
 but then when you decided what ice was 
 So well I think we've discussed it good enough today
 It was It was good talking to you 
 Maybe we'll get the next time
 Take care
 Bye-bye
