 So how serious is the subject of crime in your area
 Jeez
 Well luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here
 San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime
 but it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the outlying agricultural towns because you end up having a lot of gangs forming largely around the Hispanic core
 it seems to be that gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well that's efficient
 They're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort
 Wow
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I'd heard that phrase
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 there aren't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays
 Uh-huh
 Well there's a couple of things that I've heard 
 most of them are fairly radical in terms of what you'd have to do
 course the the reason that that these kids tend to to turn toward the drugs and everything else s- seems to be just you know the the the end results of of poverty and and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else 
 because I mean you know the parents aren't making a living at anything
 
 And they're accidental parents half the time anyway
 It's illegal 
 but it's not wrong because all their friends do it
 Yeah
 Well I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of of an actual solution to the problem 
 the the social the other social problems wouldn't wouldn't go away
 
 I mean there's there's been a lot of 
 and I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus 
 but then the more I thought about it the more sense it made is that alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else
 and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow
