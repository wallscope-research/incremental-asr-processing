 Well on this subject of invasion of privacy yes it's very easy for anybody to find out about you 
 Your 
 Yeah 
 the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast I think last week or so ago it detailed how this one person went about finding out this particular pers- from this particular person his home mortgage how much he pays for it what his payments are his Social Security number driver's license any kind of records he may have their credit card and the status of their credit
 It was just as a demonstration to show those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person 
 And it was 
 mostly it dealt with marketing companies these direct marketing associations 
 That was the primary subject 
 That's how they obtain information about segments of society and group them into age brackets their habits their hobbies their income
 And they're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer
 Uh-huh
 The open office
 Yeah 
 Not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody I suppose because it you can easily be overhear- overheard 
 and they get 
 I suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen
 Yeah 
 there's there is 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Do you work with mixed company male and female 
 or 
 Well there are a few out there
 It's I suppose it depends on who you're working for and where at
 But my own environment is open totally 
 There are no cubicles 
 There's nothing to block anything
 So yeah 
 but I guess we're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybody's record
 or the computers the the big advent of that I believe because it they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button 
 and it appears in front of them 
 and you don't have to 
 I I know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families
 That's no secret 
 and it shouldn't be that way I don't think
 I mean it's not really government for the people and by the people 
 I'll tell you that
 So 
 the only way it can change is if if everybody bands together 
 It's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that's serving in the office
 The only thing really that can be changed is for us to everybody to say we've had enough of you out you go 
 But I don't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that
 It has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done 
 I don't know 
 it's it's still a a free I suppose country insofar as we're we're able to obtain information 
 And I wouldn't be for total banning of all information 
 or it's mostly the private information that we're all concerned about 
 But it's it's hard to define a lot of those boundaries
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 So you've received a lot of flack
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Is that usually what you tell them in the letter
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Good idea
 Uh-huh 
 Well that's good 
 any other problems
 Yeah 
 I I guess I've just about run out of 
 I I can probably go on 
 but it's it's 
 I'm clouding up right now
 Well it's nice talking to you
 Maybe again
 Bye-bye
