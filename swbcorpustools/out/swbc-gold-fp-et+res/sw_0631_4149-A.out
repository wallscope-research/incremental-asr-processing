 Wendy I guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that 
 let me ask you the question 
 do you have a budget a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I see 
 I see 
 Well good 
 I'm kind of in a different situation 
 but I I I went through that too when I was in school 
 but I was I was working to get through college and and trying to make it through that 
 but I'm married and have a a couple of children 
 and we have to pretty much stick to a budget 
 I'm on a salary 
 so I don't get any overtime or anything like that 
 but We have a fixed income 
 and we have to make sure that every dollar we have will is spent accordingly 
 and what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have you know the house payment 
 we have the insurance premiums utilities and so forth 
 and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside 
 and we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the coll- the kids' education college education the future and set aside money for bonds 
 and and we also set aside an emergency fund 
 because we've we've been married for about ten years 
 and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and not enough to go and to take a loan out but you have to have money for
 And then we have you know 
 whatever's left over is disposable in- disposable dis- yeah discretionary income that we use for the rest of the month 
 so and it's worked out very well 
 It's it's helped us so that we haven't been you know too long on the month and too short on the money and try and stick with that 
 and nice thing about it I my wife is is excellent in that we both work together 
 we both have a budget 
 and we stick to it
 and there's no surprises in that 
 Well actually I have four kids
 So 
 yeah 
 I said a couple of kids 
 I I guess I should have specified 
 I have four four little boys 
 yeah
 You bet

 well what year are you in in college
 You're a sophomore 
 so you have a few more years
 Uh-huh

 Good for you 
 Yeah 
 I imagine it is a little difficult to stick with a budget during that during school and so it forth
 Yes 
 Well great

 And sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on too
 Lab fees and all 
 yes

 Well you're not a starving artist yet are you
 Good
 Well good
 The- there's enough of those in the world

 Who's who's not very well educated
 yes

 That's true 
 that's true 
 I found that out
