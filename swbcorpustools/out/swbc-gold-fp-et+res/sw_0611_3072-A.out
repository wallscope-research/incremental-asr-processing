 Okay 
 where have you all been on vacation recently
 Detroit
 Is that a nice vacation spot
 Right 
 okay
 Right 
 So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot
 that would be nice
 Did you scuba dive there
 that would be nice
 that would be enjoyable
 Right 
 yeah 
 that's a nice break 
 I haven't been on vacation in a while either 
 usually when we go we go to Colorado to Estes Park area Which is up kind of near Denver And stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the Texas heat that kind of thing
 So it's a lot of fun 
 I worked up there last summer 
 so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the whole summer long 
 Worked at a camp there 
 and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains 
 So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation
 Oh
 That's nice 
 We we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River
 And that's the best place that I've ever canoed
 It's really really pretty 
 I was a little kid then 
 and we to have 
 we stayed at some park 
 and they had a little mountain man who came down the river every night 
 and he would give a little talk about mountain things 
 You know I think he wasn't a real mountain man 
 but we were pretty convinced he was a full hermit who lived up in the woods that he'd come in his little log boat down the river 
 and we would have to we'd 
 and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found 
 and That's a good family place to go
 and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening 
 but it wasn't you know too easy either 
 It was like 
 That's true
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Well that's good 
 Well we let's see 
 the only other place I've ever vacationed we'd you know go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that 
 And then I went to England a few years ago 
 I was a student there and spent a semester studying abroad in London
 And that was a great time because it's so that's such a neat place 
 and it's there's not a language barrier 
 so you don't 
 there there's a little bit because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean 
 and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents 
 but it's it was really fun 
 I I I really enjoyed that 
 I'm probably going back there to work for a year
 It it's really nice 
 I would I would spend all my time in London or most of my time 
 and that's it was really different being in a big city 
 because I don't get much into urban you know really urban areas a lot
 and it was it's really it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are 
 and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which I thought I would just hate 
 but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone
 You could just kind of kind of walk around and observe
 I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people
 And I had a great time doing that 
 It was really interesting
 Yeah 
 I know
 I keep wanting to get up to 
 I haven't I haven't been anywhere else outside the United States 
 I haven't been to Mexico or Canada or 
 Oh
 Yeah 
 that would be nice 
 I had a friend from there
 Then I I'd love to go somewhere in Asia 
 but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that
 So yeah 
 that's why that's why England was nice 
 Even we traveled in Europe for about a week 
 and that was even nice because there wasn't the 
 most the places we went we went to Germany and Switzerland and 
 Yeah 
 we have 
 We We did we whirlwinded through Europe 
 It was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day 
 and you slept on the train at night
 But there wasn't a 
 it was strange 
 it was kind of sad 
 there wasn't ever a language problem there because everyone in Germany knew English 
 and everyone in Switzerland knew English
 So we were kind of pitiful 
 We found one restaurant we were in and got seated 
 and then no one knew English in there 
 and we were just finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things 
 But it was 
 I had fondue 
 That was easy to say 
 Tried to get fondue and white wine 
 and that was 
 we were able to have that pretty pretty effortlessly 
 There were some people at the next table who spoke English 
 so we elicited their aid for a while 
 and they were very helpful 
 so It was it was a pleasant time 
 I'd I'd love to go back there 
 There's just not time 
 There's not enough time to go see everything and then to afford to see everything
 Right 
 That's <> 
 That and sleeping late 
 I keep hoping for
 Well it was nice talking with you
 And have a good afternoon
 Okay
 Good-bye
