 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Well I've worked for well I worked for H and R Block here in Massachusetts for awhile
 And the only 
 they even hate to give out unemployment at the end of tax season because they you know they're fairly even though they're a large scale company they're very the offices the individual offices are very small
 and now I work for the Framingham <> school tea- system because I'm a teacher
 And we have much better benefits you know in the system
 We have a good pension plan 
 let me see we have a profit sharing plan to a degree
 Right 
 And we have the eye glasses the health care and the whole kit and caboodle because what they did is they threw all the town employees in together
 Yeah 
 Really
 Oh
 Right 
 The only trouble we've had here in Massachusetts is the town and state employees have run into problems especially the retired ones 
 My father's retired from the town of Framingham
 and he said that they haven't gotten a a cost of living raise in over five years
 And he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired 
 and but I hear that bill is in the Senate right now 
 and it's hopefully will go through
 But you know I think the schools are at where the schools isn't just the school system and not just the teachers 
 They took in the whole town plus all you know 
 we have the teachers union which helps out a lot 
 but the town of Framingham pays the benefits 
 and that's all the town workers water and sewer
 and where it's a very large town 
 it's actually should be a city 
 but they kept it a town
 where it's extremely large they were able to offer a little bit more which was really great because we don't have to pay a mayor 
 Right 
 because of most of our you know the town employees as far as electoral positions are part-time
 So it works out good because we reap the benefits of it
 and but as far as shopping for a job I'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary
 Right 
 Right
