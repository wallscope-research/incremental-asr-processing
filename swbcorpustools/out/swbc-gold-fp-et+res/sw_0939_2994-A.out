 Okay 
 have you participated in anything like that
 Uh-huh 
 we we have a pretty nice recycling center in our city now 
 and we take the newspapers and plastic and glass up there 
 They're open like two days a week 
 and you can just take it up there and drop it off
 It's kind of fun 
 And everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to help the earth I guess
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 my husband was complaining the other day 
 because he said every time I turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling 
 like yesterday I was tell him you have to you're supposed to squeeze the plastic jugs before you take them up there
 Every time he turns around I'm giving him some new rule where you're supposed to squish up the you know like collapse the plastic jugs Instead of taking them up there solid 
 And I wish that our recycling center took paper bags 
 They won't take those 
 We like to put our just put our newspapers in a paper bag you know and then carry them up there that way
 And we have to bring the paper bags back every time Because they won't take them 
 Do you take your papers somewhere 
 or does someone pick them up
 Uh-huh 
 We we don't take our cans up to that center though 
 our aluminum cans we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth you know worth bothering to go in and do 
 but Do you have any ideas on anything that would make 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 that would be a good idea 
 Yeah
 Right 
 Yeah 
 that would be a real good motivation for people
 Right 
 Yeah 
 my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags like you buy your garbage bag from the city
 and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag 
 but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything 
 so how ever many bags of garbage you throw away that's how many you have to pay for
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 that would be a real good idea 
 I'm trying to think if there's anything else I could think of 
 They are talking about going to curbside pickup in our in our city 
 Rowlett Texas
 Do you know where that is
 And I don't know if they decided to do or not 
 but I think they said it was going to add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that 
 Although I think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even break even point without charging people 
 Yeah <> 
 I don't know 
 I guess it just depends on how they manage it
 I don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff
 The center that they've got now where you take your stuff in I I think that should be making some money Since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week 
 And they sell I guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it
 But I wish that more of the cans you know like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable 
 I don't 
 a lot of that's that recyclable steel 
 and I don't know anybody that takes that
 Th- my husband likes Pepsi 
 and those cans are steel instead of aluminum 
 so we can't can't ever recycle them 
 I think it's a good reason to quit buying it 
 Yeah 
 that's what we buy the most of unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to put the cans in a cooler <> 
 But well that's all I can really think about for recycling
 It was good talking to you
 bye
