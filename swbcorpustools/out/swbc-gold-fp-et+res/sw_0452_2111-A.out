 Our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive
 I live in San Antonio
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 there's there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio 
 I used to work for the power company here 
 and there was discussion for a while about building a garbage burning electric generation plant 
 but it just wasn't cost effective at the time 
 And there's there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city 
 but there isn't any advertising campaign 
 There's just not any push to recycle
 I recycle my newspapers and alumi- my aluminum stuff
 But they make it as hard as possible 
 it's not very convenient to do
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yes
 Yeah 
 where I work now we recycle all the computer paper
 But that's about the extent of it
 Yeah 
 yeah
 And I'm sure that the driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so
 We sell the paper back to the to a paper manufacturing company
 Well it it defrays the cost of buying the paper I think 
 I 
 not by much but it does defray it some
 Enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building
 Yeah
 Yes
 Yeah
 Well the last time someone moved offices in my building 
 and the properties people came in with all with the good cardboard boxes 
 Not the cheap ones of course And packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around 
 I I took several home because I'm moving pretty soon 
 and they're good boxes
 And they were just going to throw them away
 Yeah
 Huh-uh
 Right 
 and and these boxes are 
 you can unfold them
 So you know there they don't take up much storage space
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I I felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until I realized they would be thrown away 
 so 
 I thought well I was doing them a favor by taking them
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 the ones at the grocery store half the time they've pulled the lid off 
 so you can't use it anyway
 Those 
 and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in with the nice lids Those get thrown away
 And I am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes
 Those are perfect boxes to put files in
 What what I've done in the past 
 I don't have any now 
 but I would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids
 and you can stack them up and and leave them out and put things in them even
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 well you know it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at Target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 *[[slash error]] Yes 
 *[[slash error should be 'aa']] yeah
 Uh-huh
 *[[slash error]] Uh-huh
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] Yeah 
 I live near a Walmart 
 and there's a big huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front 
 in fact I think there's two of them that have several openings
 and it's for recycling 
 and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category
 I don't 
 maybe there's two for aluminum 
 And you don't get paid 
 but it's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 It gets to be 
 I guess you have to make it a habit 
 you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 And someone else isn't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well I've enjoyed talking to you
 Well I thank you 
 Bye 
 bye
