 Okay 
 What type of things do you feel would invade your privacy every day
 Yeah 
 that's right 
 That is really an invasion of privacy
 I I find it very annoying when I've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly the solicitors and the carpet cleaning companies and 
 Does that happen in your part of the country
 I I come home 
 and I am trying to get a few things done 
 and I can't do anything but answer the telephone
 Some evenings are worse than others 
 but I wish I could put a stop to it 
 but I don't know what to do to stop it
 Uh-huh
 They would think it didn't mean them I guess
 Everybody but me 
 goodness 
 Are you stil- do you live at home with your parents
 Uh-huh
 So your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family
 Now what can you do to stop that
 No
 Just have to live with it I guess
 Try to remember to respect their privacy 
 and maybe they will respect yours 
 and 
 Do you have brothers
 okay 
 I was ra- 
 I had two younger brothers 
 and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations 
 and 
 I would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldn't hear me 
 and then they would go get on the other extension
 and I could hear them 
 but I couldn't get them to hang up you know
 Even it in the office I find that people walk up and and when you're on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy they'll stand there and listen to what you say until you hang up
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Let's see I can't think of anything else I'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors 
 About the only thing that really bothers me I don't have that many people coming to my door
 Uh-huh
 And I guess that's really th- the thing that really bugs me the most 
 I can't think tha- 
 our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me 
 but they've all gotten grown up now
 and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me since mine are all grown up 
 but What else would be an annoyance 
 Well I guess traffic could be an annoyance
 Do you have a lot of traffic in your area
 Uh-huh 
 Some days it's real real bad here 
 and you would like to feel like it's an invasion of privacy because you can't even ride down the road without people all the way around you you know 
 But 
 It really is 
 and pretty noisy
 It really is
 I live right on a main thoroughfare 
 so when I first moved here I probably did consider that an invasion of privacy 
 because it at first you'd hear a lot of noise especially at night you know when you go to bed
 And every time a a fire truck or anything went down the road I would wake up 
 but I guess I have gotten used to it because I don't even hear it anymore
 And I just close it out I guess because I don't I don't remember waking up in several years at night when I'd hear a fire truck go by you know
 I think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me 
 They would have to chop down the door and get you out I guess 
 Let's see What else is an invasion
 Oh
 Well did you have has name all over them
 That was yours 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
