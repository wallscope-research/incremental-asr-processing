 Hi
 Well I mostly listen to popular music 
 I listen to it all the time in in my car 
 so I I tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because I don't like commercials 
 But I find myself listening to popular music 
 and quite honestly I I have some little children 
 and I unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately 
 but that's not by my choice
 How about you
 Lucky you
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 How do you feel about rap music
 It seems to be so popular these days
 Uh-huh
 Right
 When it was really just starting
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 you really 
 It seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music 
 A lot of times you'll hear songs that you know they're not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm 
 And sounds it sounds so much different 
 and yet I I have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music 
 and she thinks its pretty funny how often I know all of the words to songs that she's listening to 
 and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces
 That's right
 No
 Yeah 
 I guess there was even a a bit of ruckus caused by the M C Hammer who's really you know
 seems to be the hot one of of today 
 He used WILD THING 
 Do you remember that that song
 he used 
 I can't remember who the artist was on that
 Who
 Was it 
 well ma- maybe it wasn't that one 
 Because it was a living it was a living person that I'm I'm thinking of that that said "You know hey that those are my words" 
 And I guess that they because they hadn't originally gotten permission from him to use it 
 And he he since then has has amended that and paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on 
 but 
 Maybe so 
 I I can't think
 Yeah
 Right 
 They destroyed it
 yeah
 I I remember seeing the video of it on M T V 
 and I thought it was hideous
 It was 
 ugh I didn't like that either
 I remember I saw him in a concert when I was 
 I think it was in high school
 Uh-huh 
 He was very good 
 I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in Philadelphia 
 It was in J F K Stadium if I can remember
 Hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 No 
 You can only laugh 
 Right 
 well they 
 I guess our age is showing when we we think that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Like Paul Simon 
 Like 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 What do you mean by world music
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 
 Right
 No
 So then it becomes a kind of music of of it's own so to speak 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 The 
 are they trying to 
 We've talked our five minutes though
 I've been listening to that a lot lately
 yeah
