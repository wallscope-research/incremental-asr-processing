 Okay 
 well do you have a pet
 Two cats 
 you're lucky
 Your two fish 
 Well my husband 
 you know how sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing
 My husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog 
 So we have a black Labrador
 Beautiful gorgeous black Labrador 
 but to me he belongs up in the field you know in the ranch in the farm 
 and 
 Well because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind he sleeps in the laundry room 
 and then he goes out for the day 
 But this this is a beautiful dog 
 and he is wonderful with our little girls 
 and he is he's comes from a purebred line 
 and there's nothing you could say bad about him except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle
 And this is huge 
 You know course when he runs around the yard he just digs 
 he doesn't know that he's tearing up things 
 but he does
 And the worst part that I had with him he's he's three now was when he was about eight months old 
 and I did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one 
 and I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour 
 And I came home 
 and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall
 And it was in the floor 
 and I just about lost it 
 and I called 
 and I said come home and get your dog 
 And so he said well puppies just chew when they're nervous and I well I wish you had told me you know 
 and it was about eight months later he ate a piece of the linoleum 
 He kept picking at it 
 and I didn't kn- 
 the the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it 
 So the last thing he did was when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch 
 And I told my husband 
 I said you know it's either me or the dog 
 and he looked at me like you know 
 He loves this dog 
 and every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him 
 and he's a good dog 
 so it's one of those things I'm just having to get used to 
 and that's why I laughed when they called with the topic 
 I thought boy do I have a pet 
 But I I grew up with cats 
 and I'm very comfortable 
 Yeah
 Oh
 She's old
 Isn't she
 I started to say 
 then you broke your heart
 Oh
 Oh
 Bless your heart
 That makes me feel so bad
 Yeah 
 no 
 Oh
 no 
 that's awful 
 I never heard of that before
 Uh-huh
 Or the smell or something
 Uh-huh
 Well d- now does your cat sleep in the house 
 They are they are house cats
 Yeah
 yeah 
 good
 Oh
 But the cat doesn't destruct does it 
 See it doesn't do anything
 See 
 no
 Yeah
 Oh
 no
 that is
 They do wreck things
 Well I'm not either
 I'm not either 
 and it's just been 
 He's beautiful 
 but it's just one of those concessions I just had to make 
 but I kind of ignore him 
 Now today's the first cold we've had in Texas 
 and it's really cold and drizzly 
 and it's freezing
 and people are doing their fires 
 and I brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there 
 and he's in the laundry room with this little carpet square 
 and he's just huddled up like if you'll be nice to me I won't make any trouble you know
 And then my daughters both have hamsters
 And I I 
 They're eleven and eight 
 and I gave in at Christmas 
 and they have they keep their cages real clean 
 It always smells of cedar 
 and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and 
 <> I think they're cutting us off
 Oh
 okay
 Okay
 okay
 I understand
 Okay 
 
 they'll cut us off pretty soon
 Yeah 
 I know
 How does 
 In the salt water
 Salt water or 
 Yeah
