 So what's it been doing up there
 really
 Oh 
 Well 
 Oh
 my goodness 
 Well we have been drenched
 We have had so much rain for May and June that we've got all the weather people down here really confused
 we 
 it's probably 
 it it's just 
 Yeah 
 Right now 
 by now it's usually 
 no 
 you know it's quit raining you know by at least a month
 And it's still 
 we're still having April showers for June
 Yeah 
 I don't know where where it came from 
 but it's been really 
 we got a lot of 
 we're in central Texas 
 and it feels like we live in Houston
 Yeah 
 it's it it you know 
 like it rained today 
 and then it just kind of steamed everything up you know
 it's been great because we haven't had to use our sprinkler system 
 but it's it's hard to plan anything outside just because they show up out of nowhere and then they're gone 
 We've had some with really really high winds that have trashed trees and everything else 
 It's just 
 Yeah 
 Well I hope you get some of that
 We got enough
 We have had plenty 
 and we're still forecast for more
 Yeah
 So 
 I'm not real sure 
 I think a lot of this is coming out of 
 I think what's happen- of 
 it's coming out of Canada
 and it's meeting what's coming out of the Gulf
 And it's just causing chaos 
 and these are good these are good summer rains you know electrical storms and and all that 
 so it's been it's been wet
 And we've moved our yard I think three or four times in the last two or three weeks
 just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing 
 and and one one week it just rained thunderstormed for a day straight 
 and you couldn't get out there
 You just couldn't get out there 
 By the time you finally got out there where your lawn mower wouldn't sink we were you know 
 yeah 
 lawn mower broke 
 So 
 Oh
 Well what always works for me is if I water my plants or we wash the car it usually rains 
 If not that night the next day 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 
 Hotter than usual
 Wow
 
 
 I guess that means you're going to get a double long summer Because you surely wouldn't get 
 No 
 I wouldn't think so 
 I wouldn't 
 not as early as it came 
 your talking September maybe
 That's a little early 
 Still the 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 And we were there we were in New Jersey last October
 and it was hotter there than it was here
 It was just like a heat wave
 And I was like I want to go home Because we had we packed to cool off you know brought shorts and sweaters and everything 
 and we just died
 It was really hot 
 so But I like it here 
 I wouldn't I wouldn't trade it for snow any day
 Yeah
 Right 
 And I can handle a vacation in it 
 and you know but my husband is from New Jersey 
 and he wouldn't go back either 
 He did all the shoveling and everything else 
 He said it was a pain
 So 
 No 
 I don't think so 
 Well see last year we had snow at Christmas time
 So it really wasn't it was weird because we had snow 
 It's like wow it actually fell on the right day
 So no 
 it's not 
 In fact you know we're used to running around in you know spring clothes in December 
 and so when it throws in a real cool winter we get broken pipes and and all that kind of stuff and because Texas is just isn't built for you know real cold weather for long periods of time
 No 
 not not were we are 
 Now in Houston and stuff they've got it they've got it where no hairsprayer works 
 It's so humid at times 
 but here it's it's just about right 
 It's it's pretty dry and not too dry where you know you just it hurts to breathe 
 but we're just about right 
 We're just having this all this rain 
 and late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable 
 Made it the humidity real high 
 But no 
 I like it 
 Well we're right in a good stop because we're you know we get over in the over the hundreds in the summer
 but it's it's not it's a dry heat 
 and it's not really as hot and muggy as it would be being over a hundred plus ninety degree humidity ninety percent humidity 
 so 
 Oh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I know what 
 So we like it where we're at 
 If it's not a whole bunch of everything at once type stuff
 So But no 
 it's interesting when it gets really cold here 
 and people forget that they're live in Texas 
 and they don't know how to drive in snow 
 and you know But I wouldn't trade it for anything 
 I was born in Texas 
 and I visited other areas 
 and I'm just a sun person I think
 I've gotten used to it
 Yeah 
 weather is not real hard to talk about 
 It doesn't last real long either
 I thought the weather is the last thing you talk about
 but in this case it's the only thing to talk about
 But well Michelle it's great talking to
