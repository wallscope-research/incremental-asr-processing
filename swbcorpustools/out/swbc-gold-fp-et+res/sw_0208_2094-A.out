 Robert what do you think what substances do you think are the most likely causes of air pollution
 Right
 Do you do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like ai- acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from industrial areas factories and so on
 I was going to say 
 and and you so you understand smog 
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 My word
 And that was a few years ago
 I I wonder if it's any better now Because they California has such strict rules about emissions and so on 
 I I don't know if you he- re- heard about the recent legislation in Colorado against a power company that's actually on Indian land I believe 
 but it has been ruled against regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon And particularly in the winter months 
 So they 
 it was a landmark case because it's unusual to 
 I can 
 they they were talking about shutting it down or if it didn't comply and so on
 I don't know that 
 the information is one of those wire services kind of news pieces of news you know 
 so it's hard 
 I never did see the full story 
 so I don't know
 But they said that that it really caused so much smog over the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the piloting you know the helicopter trips and that sort of thing Which would be horrible because the there's nothing 
 that's such a spectacle 
 It would be a shame to ruin it
 what do you think individuals could do or society could do to alleviate this problem
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 you think it's more more to society 
 Well I guess I kind of agree there 
 I 
 on an individual basis there isn't a lot we can do about a lot of things 
 but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can force government that we elect to deal more seriously with it
 And I do think that we have a responsibility there 
 I must admit I'm not always real politically active 
 but I do think that Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards
 And it's brought the 
 they really listen to 
 the the lobbyist and the car manufacturing companies have you know have really pushed 
 they 
 all those re- restrictions are really too hard 
 we can't we can't quite make that go 
 and they don't 
 and then we still live with air pollution
 so I suspect that that's one thing that that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators 
 But as a society I think we can do more 
 and that's probably how we ought to do it individ- being individually responsible as gro- in order to be group responsible 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 I suspect that the pub- that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure come to bear on the companies that deal with it 
 and probably the only way that can happen is for governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't
 And I don't know how long that that will take
 Sure
 Exactly 
 yeah 
 right
 Right
 Well it's just the same thing with the car the gasoline 
 now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline so that we don't run into the kind of problems we recently had 
 and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent 
 and they don't want they don't want to pay for it 
 So instead we spend billions of dollars going to war
 you know wha- 
 however it might have had other causes 
 Certainly oil was a big factor
 and I think that's probably going to happen with with such things as air pollution when we when we se- get serious about cleaning about our motors in our automobiles then then maybe you know we'll have a little bit of help 
 do you have any air pollution in your area
 no 
 Your talking about from from the the middle middle states that that have more factories and so on
 Yeah 
 we really don't have that either 
 Although I think I can tell a difference in I lived in this area for about twenty-five years and I think I can tell a difference in the comfort level particularly in the summer you know when it gets hot and you have the that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air usually they say caused by exhaust
 It seems to me that I'm more uncomfortable 
 and you know my eyes sting more and so on and so on 
 So I suspect that it's it's an ever growing problem
 Well I suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here
 It was nice talking to you
 So did I 
 Bye bye
