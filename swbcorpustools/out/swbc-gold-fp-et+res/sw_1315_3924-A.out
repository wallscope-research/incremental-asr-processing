 Uh go ahead 
 AIDS research is something that that I think th- whether our country is putting enough money into it 
 and actually I'm concerned that they're not 
 I have a friend who is working with uh who works with uh travel groups
 and one of the ones that he's w- worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS uh conference in uh California
 And these were from other people from other countries 
 He's a translator
 And in talking to the people from France he said you know 
 he says one of the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you enough about how it pervasive and frightening this epidemic is 
 And they're letting the information out slowly about how you know how big it is 
 Which is scary you know pretty scary when so many people get it 
 So I guess I'm I'm I'd like to see us spend more 
 I don't know that spending more always gets it
 You mean more money for that means less for cancer or 
 Y- yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well it 
 I I agree with you there 
 because I know every time that i- something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one 
 and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie
 Money from money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly 
 or do they both get served 
 Uh that's a good point
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Well and one of the things I'd 
 and I'm with you that I don't know is is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more
 That's that's the part that 
 That's the part that scares me you know 
 I mean beginning with this is this is just for homosexuals 
 well no 
 it's for homosexuals and gays 
 well no 
 actually it's 
 I mean you know 
 Did they know that all along
 Oh 
 Right 
 And how is it really transmitted et cetera 
 Which is I think what they also don't know 
 I mean that's 
 I think they they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say you know
 It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble you know they just as soon not approve of anyway 
 but but that isn't how it was in Africa
 In Africa was the men and women and and had nothing to do with that 
 and it's huge over there 
 So I I you know 
 and it's beginning t- other countries 
 that's what's his point 
 This was an international conference where people are saying well but in my country it's you know like this 
 And does that mean like flus and everything else there are all these different strains of it
 I mean I don't know 
 All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know 
 Uh or maybe they understand but 
 Yeah 
 and uh and then the people that have it 
 it does seem that there are are some drugs that are there that you know they keep holding back 
 If you if I were dying I'm not sure I would care
 Yeah 
 right 
 I'll take anything you know 
 I mean if I'm dying if I know I'm dying you can experiment on me 
 Go ahead 
 Exactly 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 And that's what I think they're saying too
