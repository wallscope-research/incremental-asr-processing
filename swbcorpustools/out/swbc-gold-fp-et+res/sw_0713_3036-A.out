 Well if you had to pick a a type of music that you like would you be able to
 *[[functions as a qw]] Country music 
 I 
 *[[ slash error]] are you from Texas
 *[[slash error]] Not originally 
 Where you from
 Georgia 
 Okay well see 
 I'm I'm from Chicago 
 so I'm kind of in a different category here 
 I would probably go with 
 it's tough I think I would just stick with the classics Only because I like music just for music's sake 
 and you know I'm from the era where you know we had all the rock and roll 
 I'm forty 
 so I'm you know part of that whole deal
 and that was a real interesting time 
 and you know the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound 
 but I think I'd stick back with my Beethoven and my Bach and my Mozart 
 because it's just 
 it will always be there 
 It's classic 
 and I don't have to worry about you know what's current and what's not because I haven't been current with music for a long time 
 But you know same 
 and as far as country music is I've never really listened to it 
 because that's just 
 it was 
 it wasn't part of what I knew 
 so there you go 
 Right 
 yeah
 I 
 it's it's a different perspective on everything too 
 I I know well whenever they talk about country music it's about it seems sad to me 
 It's always about some guy losing some girl and then you know playing the guitar and singing about it
 Yeah 
 Well I must say though I listen to Amy Grant 
 Do you consider her country
 let's see Well name some people that are country that I should listen to <> 
 That would be good
 Okay
 okay 
 I I must admit that's yeah they're fantastic 
 so 
 She's something though 
 She's got so much energy 
 Well I guess I I have listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that I do like some of that 
 Dolly Parton she's kind of 
 is she kind of country
 Kind of 
 Right down there
 how about the Oak Ridge Boys
 Very much 
 Okay 
 well I like them too 
 So I guess I've had a smattering 
 and I just you know picked 
 I've picked up a little bit along the way that I probably wouldn't have if I'd stayed up north you know
 You know so well I think there's music all around anyway 
 I think life is just music 
 so you know you can hear it wherever you want 
 and and I've I've kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because I just don't understand it 
 But maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which I really like 
 so 
 Yeah 
 the greatest hits 
 right
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 so it it it'll if it stands the test of time we'll see
 And then it'll 
 if it survives then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of hey listen what we listened to /
 Can you believe this sort of thing 
 but you know I I think of 
 I get real tickled when I listen to some of these old Beatle music you know the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still 
 and and you know all these rocks rock stations call it classic soft rock you know 
 But we used to listen to it full blast 
 Yeah 
 So it's kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff 
 but I don't know 
 Well you got any more
 Well that's 
 Okeydoke 
 well it was great
 Yeah 
 And we'll listen to some more music 
 and I'll look at some country
 Okay 
 Bye-bye
