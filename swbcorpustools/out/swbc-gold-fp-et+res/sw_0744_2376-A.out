 Now 
 I'm sorry
 And I do that 
 we recycle newspapers 
 We take you know the DALLAS MORNING NEWS daily and the Plano paper daily 
 and you know after a month of that you got a ton of newspapers
 It really does
 I do recycle newspapers and glass
 We don't really have enough plastic to mess with 
 we don't you know like we don't drink milk 
 and we don't have children 
 so we don't have you know six thousand plastic milk jugs a month you know 
 Yeah
 Right
 But there is you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different container
 And Plano has plans 
 I believe it's tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year 
 the city is going to leave receptacles at people's home
 and they ca- 
 It certainly would 
 and they can separate it 
 and then the you know trash guys will pick it up Which would really be handy you know for people like shut ins or people who can't or don't drive you know
 they can't get to the these centers
 And I'm sure rather than try to ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them you know
 But I think that's probably a good idea
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 Uh-huh 
 yes
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Great 
 I bet it was 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It's just a matter of education I think
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 yeah 
 that's right
 I think basically it's a good idea you know 
 I hope it works
 Absolutely 
 absolutely
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Absolutely 
 And there's just you know the two of us my wife and I 
 and it's amazing how much stuff j- just the two of us generate
 you know I can imagine a family of you know four or five
 It really does
 As far as new stuff to recycle you know I don't really I don't really know 
 I really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth
 That's right 
 I was 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I see
 I'm sure it must 
 Yes 
 you know I'm not personally involved because I don't you know I don't have any s- children that wear diapers
 but I'm sure it creates a large amount of you know refuse 
 That's right 
 That's right
 Absolutely
 That's right 
 absolutely
 absolutely
 Uh-huh
 I think they're made out of aluminum
 Yes 
 There are there is a receptacle you know at the centers also for aluminum
 but again we don't we don't generate that much 
 so 
 we don't
 Yeah
 That's right
 that 
 ninety-nine percent of ours is newspaper and you know glass
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Car batteries
 Uh-huh
 I don't you know I don't change my own oil
 so I don't I don't don't have that problem
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 well we do to as a matter of fact
 *[[typo too]] Right 
 Yeah
 Yes 
 we have one of those in town 
 Uh-huh
 You know our church each year has a 
 one of their major fund raisers is you know a garage sale
 And there's a ton of clothes always you know left over 
 and I take those down to the 
 it's called the Clothes Closet
 that's what it's called here in Plano
 Right
 Uh-huh
 And they distribute them to the people that need them
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 No 
 I can't either 
 I really can't 
 no 
 I I really can't either
 Okay 
 well it was nice talking to you
 Okay
 All right 
 Bye-bye
