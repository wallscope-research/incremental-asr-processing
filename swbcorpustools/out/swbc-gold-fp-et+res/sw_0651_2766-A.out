 We're supposed to talk about the Middle East Crisis and should we be involved and uh what's it going to cost us in the long run
 Are you ready
 The Middle East Crisis should we be there
 Well you realize why we were in the Middle East Why we invaded Iraq why we were in Saudi why we attacked Kuwait and we we're why we are still fighting Iraq
 No 
 I really believe it's because 
 I think it has something to do with oil don't get me wrong
 But Saddam is Saddam is a madman
 Anyone that would use chemical weapons to fight his own people 
 And obviously that has something to do with it
 And and if you know 
 I can see that he was in Kuwait
 Kuwait was the nonaggressor
 and the Saudis are our allies 
 We have several treaties and several alliances with the Saudis that range back for probably forty years
 You know they've been our friends through thick and thin
 They were at the Saudi border And ready to storm into Saudi 
 Shouldn't we try and help our friends
 What did we lose forty-one Americans lives 
 
 of course our government is full of liars thieves and crooks
 And that's our own fault because we elected them
 You know it's 
 I went on jury duty here not long back
 And one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if if you could believe a lawyer or if a lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed 
 and one guy being selected snickered and couldn't keep his head up you know
 and the guy said Well can you share it with us what you what you find so funny 
 He says Well I already told you my sons a lawyer 
 He said that when he graduated the day after his bar examine there in Houston
 He told him Dad you know how to tell when a lawyers lying to you 
 His lips are moving
 And ninety percent of all politicians and lawyers 
 So by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars 
 The fact that they take our money and don't do what we think is right makes them thieves
 So what's it going to cost us in the long run there in Saudi 
 Are we going to lose more lives there
 Well we hit them with more in one month than we used in three years the last three years of Vietnam
 And whenever you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume there's nothing they can do about it
 You know it's not like we threw eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong
 We were there 
 the Brits were there
 The French were there 
 This is with U N backing
 and to some level even Russia was behind
 So honestly if there is was a well perceived war world wide this was it
 But what I can't understand is then many of the Kuwaiti youth didn't fight wouldn't fight 
 It's okay for us to go extend our youth's lives like so much water in the desert
 And it's not their job to fight for their own land
 And really from all I can indica- from all indications the Iraqi beliefs if you will are more similar to our own
 And the Kuwaitis aren't even helping rebuild their own country 
 The Kuwaiti young won't rebuild anything 
 They won't work
 Yeah 
 it was on the news last night
 The U S Army is doing it all
 Well they talked to one Kuwaiti woman yesterday
 And her biggest concern in life was that she couldn't get a housekeeper
 And do you have a housekeeper
 Well I wouldn't mind having one
 But you know I'd like to make sure that I have a job tomorrow first
 It it astound 
 you realize that the Kuwaiti government gives every Kuwaiti man woman and child money
 For nothing
 For noth- for for doing nothing 
 For sitting on there kiesters
 that ought to give their programming trouble shouldn't it
 they do nothing 
 They hand them money each year 
 and they're part of
