 Go ahead
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I guess that's the way I am too 
 I sometimes I hear some things on on the radio
 I only get the newspaper on the weekends 
 so 
 Uh-huh 
 I I guess occasionally I'll hear someone at work say something though
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well I I guess it's pretty good 
 And and like the Dallas area 
 and I I guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this 
 there's I guess a lot of pressure in that business to borderline at that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 true 
 I'll bet that was the case of the the war in the Middle East
 Uh-huh 
 true 
 Trying to think what else is is current
 Well I don't know what to say 
 that's a bad one 
 they 
 looks like we're going to have an income tax in Texas
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's true
 I would think they could find a better way to fund it though 
 but they haven't for 
 Well they're struggling with it
 Uh-huh 
 True
 I I'm not sure there's a positive solution for that
 Trying to think what else is current
 Well the other thing I can think of is what is still going on in Iraq and the Kurd refugees
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and finish the job while we were in there
 Uh-huh 
 Seems to have helped him though popularity wise 
 
 Yeah 
 Were were they in any of the areas where they some of the Scuds 
 
 Um-hum 
 Yeah
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I'll bet
 I don't know anything else that's current other than the weather 
 and 
 Have have you all been getting rain storms down there
 We did we did last night some real massive thunderstorms
 Apparently I I don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too
 Caused some damage
 We may get some more tonight
 Uh-huh 
 Well the the ground here is so flat 
 and it's all saturated now
 we're getting some flooding
 
 Goodness
 Yeah 
 It's a lot more humid down that way
 In fact miserable
 Yeah 
 I think there were places around downtown Fort Worth last night they got three inches in a real short period of time like an hour or so just a bunch 
 Well I guess that's it 
 That's about as much as we can do with current events
 Good talking to you Michelle
 Bye-bye
