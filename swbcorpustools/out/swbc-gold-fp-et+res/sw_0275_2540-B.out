 Well on a scale of one to ten being ten no kind of legislation and zero being total ban I probably would lean more towards six or seven 
 I feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals
 I lived in Massachusetts for two years 
 and they have a total ban on guns 
 and I saw that it didn't stop crime in that state
 Any any kind of firearms
 Yeah 
 it's 
 there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught with a firearm 
 and also I think there was a fine
 No 
 I don't 
 the the crime is not any better or any worse 
 it's 
 I I shouldn't say I don't know if it was any worse 
 but it certainly didn't get any better
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I I agree with that
 I I think that the the law is on who can buy a gun are are way too lax
 I think that I think that the 
 Yeah
 I 
 Yeah 
 I I'm I'm not really sure 
 I don't personally I don't own a gun
 and I don't think I probably ever would although I would like to know how to handle one 
 and I think it's good that everyb- and I think everybody should learn how to handle one
 you just never know when you might come into contact with one
 
 No 
 nobody in my family hunted 
 my father had had guns when I was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in Massachusetts 
 We lived in New Hampshire at the time
 And he lived in Massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns
 so we ended up with these guns
 and my really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right 
 and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere
 And so that was really the only experience that I've had with guns 
 and it it kind of scared me
 But I think that if I learn how to use one I would I would feel better
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Uh-huh
 I would definitely support that
 Yeah 
 I I I agree the thing that scares me though about where I would I would wa- definitely want some sort of legislation 
 and coming from the north east I'm just not used to seeing these 
 and I I know this may sound kind of stereo typical 
 but <> the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks That's kind of scary to me 
 that kind of to me it is more like vigilantism 
 You know and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on in L A on the freeways
 and then you come here in in the Dallas area 
 I don't I don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles especially not in the back window for everybody to see
 Sure you're welcome
 Okay 
 bye-bye
