 Compile more statistics
 Uh-huh
 More especially where you are 
 Are you in Washington D C or Washington state
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I was going to say 
 yeah
 It just really grabs your attention
 It just makes the whole place seem like that
 Yeah
 What do you what do you think is causing all this
 because it seems that there 
 even though 
 crime though I think it is increasing in number it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity and violence too
 Uh-huh
 *[[slash error]] 
 *[[slash error should be 'b']] Yeah 
 I was I have not seen that 
 but 
 Yeah
 Well yeah 
 I tend to agree with you with you know 
 it seems anymore a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some some sort of violence or something in it 
 And and along with that you know 
 and then you start making a movie and it has no there's no call for something violent 
 but so they just throw something in there just to say they have it 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you become callous
 Yeah
 Yeah
 
 Yeah
 I listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time Rush Lynn Bottom 
 *[[sp: Limbaugh]] I do not know if you listen to him or not
 he's on A M 
 but ther- there's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the 
 there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for Los Angeles the guy under Gates
 and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was just some of the things that he believed in some of his morals 
 For instance they asked him if he spanked his kids 
 and he said "You bet I believe in discipline" 
 And people I I I I guess they confus- confused discipline with punishment
 You know 
 And just 
 it seems anymore that if if you have you know this type of a moral stance that people come down on you 
 It's like you know hey everybody has to be free to do their own thing 
 And I disagree 
 and I think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime
 Yeah
 Well nobody feels responsibility to do something 
 It's like boy I wish they would stop doing that
 Yeah 
 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 and then how many 
 How many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between you know what you see and how yo- 
 what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do
 And yes 
 but you know as soon as you start 
 Yeah 
 unfortunately you have got a lot of the 
 some well a lot of it can be contributed to th- the racial differences just that we are so close to the border with Mexico 
 we have got a lot of that influence
