 Well what do you think about it
 No 
 I don't either
 I don't think it's going to change very much 
 but 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well you know the funny thing I find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the American public goes crazy
 And now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in in Iraq they're going crazy
 You know you can't please them one way or the other
 You know and I and I think that I I agree with you 
 this is exactly the right course 
 that's an internal problem to Iraq 
 It has nothing to do with us
 And until he starts doing something so inhumane that the U N gets involved then it's nobody's business
 
 All the time 
 yeah 
 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 and it's certainly and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years
 And it's going to continue
 As long as you have so many diverse groups that are that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time
 the Kurds have tried it before 
 They've gotten their butts kicked
 and this is just another time that it's happening
 You know they'll regroup out in the mountains 
 and they'll try it again in a couple of years
 Sure 
 and and and I don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it You know
 But I'm not real sure that we promised them anything
 I 
 that would have been stupid
 and and I don't think we did it 
 Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right 
 I don't think they would have done that
 But it just it it really doesn't make any difference 
 This is just a a another chapter in Middle Eastern history
 sure 
 the the British occupied the place 
 the French occupied it 
 we've done it 
 It it's happened so many times 
 this is this is really nothing special 
 That's right 
 it's al- it's mostly religious anyway 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 Well I I I think one of the big problems 
 looking at it from the Am- the American public's standpoints they don't understand the Middle Easterners
 They don't understand what 
 their politics really isn't politics 
 It's religion couched as politics
 And there's a big difference
 You know we sit there 
 and and we think that they think the way we think
 And that's a big mistake because they don't
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 That's that's it a lot of the time 
 I I was stationed in in Turkey for for a year and a half
 And it it was tough under- understanding those folks
 You know it they they're they're so completely different culturally and socially and and religiously 
 it's just it was very strange
 It was very interesting 
 Now I 
 shoot I I think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't don't have a clue sometimes 
 You know they they sit there and and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert
 Well I'm not real sure that's that's appropriate
 No
 Well I sort 
 that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country too
 And we make experts by reading books
 You know and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I I I guess you work for T I
 So you guys are well aware of the problems with the Japanese markets and everything else
 Yeah 
 It's it's like our car industry 
 the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the Japanese you know came into it and helped us out
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and until we until we start changing our educational system we're we're going to be 
 we're we've already been overtaken 
 but it's going to get even worse later
 looks who's looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the the math and the science and everything
 It's not us
 You know we we've got folks running around here who get who get degrees in basket weaving and you know underwater psychology or some some ridiculous stuff like that 
 And and where are the engineers coming from
 Yeah 
 exactly 
 My my roommate is a 
 he's getting his doctorate in industrial 
 well it's not industrial engineering 
 it's human factors
 His degree was in industrial engineering
 and he's from the Philippines
 And the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it
 He has no intention of going back to the Philippines because there's no jobs
 You know but I I see it all too often 
 we've got loads of foreign students
 and they're coming here going after the hard degrees 
 and then they're going back to Korea and Japan and Hong Kong and everywhere else 
 and they're applying it there
 And I don't know 
 it's to me it's amazing 
 I don't know what we're going to do as a country 
 We're we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 you 
 I don't I don't think there can be anymore long range planning 
 I think it it's it's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike
 You know it here's a crisis 
 Well let's plug it up
 I don't know 
 I don't know what the answer is 
 It's far beyond me
 Yeah 
 all we can do is keep plugging
 You know I I wonder 
 I I read in the paper just last week I B M's unveiling their new laptop computer
 Well at a price tag of six thousand bucks I don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers
 Be- 
 now I have the I- I have the I B M P S two
 but I'm sorry I got it
 It's slow 
 it's there are many better machines on the market right now for a 
 the only reason I got it is because I got it through an educational purchase plan through the school
 and I saved forty-eight percent
 so I said yeah if I can have an I B M for forty-eight percent discount I'll take it
 But up to that point I had nev- I had always said I would never have one because I wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name
 But 
 now you watch 
 just sure as anything the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it
 Uh-huh 
 It's already outdated
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I I can imagine 
 I years ago I remember when I had a T I ninety-nine Put all the money into the expansion box and all this that and the other 
 and things just kept changing so much 
 and I kept getting rid of them 
 and I finally said well you can't do this 
 You've got to buy something and stick with it 
 so I so I just 
 at an opportune time I got one that that suited my needs 
 and I've just stuck with it 
 The only thing I've done to it is just add a add a mouse and a hard drive
 And that's all I plan to do 
 Of course I'm limited on memory now because I've got the low line 
 I got the model twenty-five
 So I'm stuck with six forty 
 but I'm not a power user 
 so it doesn't matter
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 now my roomie on the other hand he is a power user
 He's he's looking now to get rid of his 
 He's got a three eighty-six and wants to get a four eighty-six You know this kind of stuff
