 mostly what I do 
 I do do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing 
 and then I I read a lot
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 you can pick it up and take it wherever you go any space 
 I get too involved in reading sometimes that I neglect what I should be doing
 You get so involved in what you're reading
 I do a little bit of woodworking 
 well I used to 
 I don't have the equipment here 
 We moved to Dallas about a year ago
 and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment
 and I did some of that 
 here I've mostly done things that I can do strictly by hand sewing and quilting and 
 <> what else have I done 
 Things to hang on the wall
 Mostly just stuff that I can you know use right around the house or give away as gifts
 I've been making a lot of quilts well not a lot but several quilts lately
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I've done some cross cross stitch 
 but I never count right 
 and I always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered or or something 
 It never has worked out completely
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 The first project I started out one was a big one 
 it was it was of a lady 
 and she was kneeling 
 and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe
 And I 
 it was just too much to start with 
 And I still haven't finished it because I I stopped 
 and I thought I better do some simple things and work up to this because it was just so difficult to get it done 
 And there were so many different shadings and colors 
 and and it was just too much to begin with 
 And I think kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it
 And I've done some of the crewel and the something similar to that 
 but it doesn't have the specific stitches 
 Anyway it's a little bit more loose and not quite as structured 
 and I like that a little bit better the variety of stitches and stuff in that 
 More like embroidery or something 
 Yeah 
 I was reading when you called
 How about movies 
 do you like to go to movies
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Well we 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's the hard work
 It's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers 
 it's so beau- 
 we don't 
 We live in an apartment also
 I've got a few plants here 
 but I'm not really knowledgeable 
 I feel real good if I water them 
 and they continue to grow 
 You know I feel like I've accomplished something
 So I enjoy it 
 but I'm just not experienced enough with 
 it Uh-huh
 yeah
 Have you tried any growing any like fruits and vegetables or anything 
 I guess vegetables are in insi- like in pots and stuff
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I considered it last year 
 and this year both 
 but I haven't done anything about it
 So I think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch 
 We get lots of sunlight here 
 and the porch is screened in 
 and it's pretty large
 So I think if I just would be 
 if I'd do something be motivated enough to do something I think it would work out well
 But but there goes that motivation thing again 
 Can you can you put them right in the water
 that's good
 yeah
 Sulked for a while 
 Well I like animals 
 but we don't have any yet 
 We have a nine month old with another on the way
 and we thought well maybe when they're a little bit bigger then we'll 
 or get into a house with a little more space 
 I'd love to have have some animals
 But I like dogs 
 and my husband likes cats 
 So we haven't reached a real agreement on that yet 
 If we get a place where we can have both it'll be great 
 but until then 
 Uh-huh
 I agree with you 
 I 
 if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat or even a bird or a fish tank or something you know Something small
 that she can watch but won't take too much care
 Uh-huh
 Especially when they're not quite to the age of understanding that they're hurting you know 
 that 
 they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk
 And if I was a cat or dog I'd respond probably by biting or something 
 I don't know
 That'd be my self defense 
 But Well I think we probably reached our time limit
 okay
 Thank you for calling
 Bye-bye
