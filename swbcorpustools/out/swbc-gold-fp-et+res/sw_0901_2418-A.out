 Get us going
 Are are you at T I Austin 
 or 
 that's great 
 No 
 my daughter has talked to my daughter up here with us 
 I have another one 
 and she's talked to students 
 so I guess they have sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things 
 So they're 
 if you're a computer user 
 so my daughter has talked to two students that were non T Iers 
 So I guess 
 yeah
 W- we're on finances 
 have you have you retired 
 or 
 Oh
 yeah
 yeah 
 it's that's 
 the finances 
 I guess we're on the subject of finances 
 it is tough 
 I've been with T I 
 I'm just going to be fifteen years this year 
 and and that's a tough thing the salary thing 
 T I doesn't quite always do it right 
 Well what about our our our financial budget 
 Well you you should have a lot of information on a budget then if you're 
 Well you you you deserve an honor for that a gold star for that I guess 
 Right 
 sure
 Well I guess I do 
 I do have a long-term budget bec- 
 I got a daughter in college and one going to be in college 
 so that I've been thinking about that for quite a while 
 Now mo- monthly no 
 I'll tell you a funny story about budgeting 
 and I've been married twenty-six years 
 and I did you know that the macho thing 
 the man always did the bills for I don't know fifteen years or more 
 and I got so sick of it trying to balance the budget one 
 and I always tried to show my wife you know here's how you 
 once a year I'd say here's how you do the budget in case I get sick 
 or here's how you do the checks you know
 One day I gave her the checkbook 
 and I said I'm not doing this anymore 
 You do it 
 you learn it 
 and I've been happy ever since
 She does it all now for about ten years 
 and I don't even 
 she complains to me about it 
 she threatens me to give it back to me
 and I said I've been a happy man since I haven't fooled with that checkbook you know 
 So I know it's a big pain to try to do that
 Right
 Right 
 yeah
 Yes 
 I think that that is a tough 
 we all 
 seems to th- seems to be that way
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's you need to do that I'll I'll I'll give you a hint 
 I don't know if you're a ta- a radio talk person listener 
 Do you listen to radio talk shows
 Listen to Bruce Williams for financial advice
 He's on 
 I don't know what he's going to be in Austin 
 He's on five seventy here 
 Inter- 
 he's nationally famous 
 He's a college graduate type guy 
 He's been in all 
 he's an entrepreneur 
 and he gives very practical financial advice about cars very you know not not nothing college level basic stuff 
 His name is Bruce Williams 
 he's on national radio 
 I don't know what it would be down there 
 You might want to 
 whatever your radio talk shows are down there he's on that channel 
 It's it's five seventy up here
 And I'd listen to talk shows for everything for gardening and everything just when I'm doing chores 
 and he gives a wealth of information very practical stuff 
 and and he will help you avoid a lot of little things financially
 Yeah 
 there there's a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget 
 And I I'm not expert again because I don't really do it monthly
 Right
 I did start a college fund 
 I'm not I have one again at U T down there now her first year
 and she's almost gone through her whole college fund you know 
 Sure go ahead
 Sure
 no 
 yeah 
 right 
 they give us ten minutes 
 the only advice I give you on college would be there's a lot of scholarship money out there 
 My daughter got a little bit not much only first year 
 she got about two thousand dollars worth 
 and you ought to well as your daughters approach the college age start finding out about the scholarship monies because there is a lot of money out there 
 and 
 band 
 She got you know five hundred dollars at a at a clip through bands through leadership 
 there's all kinds of civic organ- organizations that will give you you know one shot money 
 you get a president's award if you're you're in in high school doing cer- 
 this up by here in Arlington 
 there's a lot of 
 and of course you if you you score high on the S A T you can get you know two thousand a year you know or more
 You can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades 
 She she did very well in school 
 and but she only got first year money 
 She got about two thousand dollars 
 It was only five hundred dollars at a clip from this organization 
 We called 
 There were there were two or three people 
 there was some little civic organization in Dallas that gave money away 
 and only two or three people applied 
 She applied and got five hundred dollars from that
 So look into that bit
 The year that they graduate you know before though you know while they're graduating there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything 
 and they don't even have a dozen applicants because the kids are going off after the big money
 of course you have to have some sort of record in high school of of achievement and everything 
 but sometimes it's just 
 like our band gave money away 
 We're a band booster club 
 We gave we give two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids who we think were worthy you know 
 so There's money out there
 Go ahead 
 you can talk 
 I I don't want to I want to chew up the whole line here
 I'm an engineer 
 I'm in fact I'm working the night because of the cutbacks and everything 
 my job 
 there were three managers jobs that were just dissolved 
 and so they put me on nights 
 I I call this my recession job
 And I'm working nights just kind of covering shutdown equipment and everything and just being available here 
 I don't mind 
 it beats being laid off and everything 
 And you you got to be a little flexible
 in my old age I'm trying to just hang in there until I get my kids through school 
 and then I'd like to teach maybe mathematics or something 
 I'm trying to study for that now
 Right 
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Right
 sure
 Well it's tough right now for everybody
 <> Up here in the Dallas Metroplex it's awful 
 I've got another clue for you for college
 Another clue for you for college money
 Go to work for U T 
 we have a friend who works who is a secretary for T C U you know up here
 They give you scholarship a hundred percent if you're if you work for T C U
 Yes 
 So check that one out you know
 Ask them about it 
 Call them
 And because it's full full scholarship 
 Now it's not room and board
 but it's tuition full tuition paid if your parent works at T C U
 And her her mother went over there just for that
