 Let's talk about the Middle East situation
 Now that's it's all over with you know
 I don't know 
 I understand that the U S is talking about leaving more of its planes and things over there 
 I guess they they're anti U S in that region 
 and now they're you know 
 like Syria and Egypt you know had some pressure against the U S 
 but now they now they wouldn't allow us to have a base in that region 
 but now I think they are rethinking that
 That's right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 They get so much of our money from oil anyway 
 No 
 no
 Yeah 
 I think that's a nice gesture on the Kuwaiti government part to do that 
 and a few people I guess will make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth
 Right
 Go over there and rebuild all those
 I think it's such a shame that the Iraqis had to just go destroy everything 
 I just 
 what's what good is that 
 If I can't have it you can't have it you know 
 that sounds like something a little kid would do You know
 That's right
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 The The deal with the supporting the Kurds
 Right 
 right 
 the cease-fire
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 to help out
 Yeah
 Maybe supply some arms or something
 Yeah 
 I think Bush handled has handled this whole situation quite well 
 He stood up to to the bully and didn't back down 
 and and Saddam Hussein miscalculated all along thinking that he wouldn't commit U S lives and and forces and and monies to just to liberate a little country
 And then he underestimated his ability to to wage a war with us 
 one thing when we all came over there and said Okay here we are get out and he said No I can I can win a war with you guys
 And that was a horrible miscalculation
 Not any more 
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 Right
 Saddam Hussein is not a religious person 
 but he uses it When he sees it to his advantage
 And and I think the people were smart enough to realize that 
 and I think they're afraid of him Is what they are
 The population is afraid to speak out against him 
 and I don't think he's going to be there too much longer
 Someone is going to assassinate him you know
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 That's right
 Yeah
 Right 
 right 
 I've heard reports that President Bush was staking his future on this this war and that setting a precedent saying that this League of Nations will always combine against bullies and to stop this kind of stuff in the world 
 Any would be bully would think twice if he knew that you know 
 there's this United Nations or world government or whatever they keep talking about that the whole world will deal with you
 And you can't you just can't do it and get away with it you know hoping that you know 
 because it's a world thing 
 and the nations will combine against you 
 and you can't you know you can't just do this
 yeah
 Had no had no teeth
 Right
 People 
 I guess I feel sorry for just the average you know Iraqi who has had to go through all of this and the suffering I'm sure with no water No electricity no sanitation
 must be terrible living conditions must be terrible 
 and it's not getting any better 
 the sanctions are still on
 You know except for a few medical supplies they are allowing through now and then powdered milk I guess for babies and things 
 and until they 
 I guess yesterday they came out with this these rules I guess or whatever For a permanent permanent cease-fire 
 and the Kuwaitis said We don't want to have to repay Israel for all the bombing that we did that was in there you know
 But that's only fair
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It's going to be really tough for them to swallow 
 but we don't want a Kuwait there that's also you know just has no power at all 
 and that that you know 
 because Iran still isn't too friendly with them
 And we don't want you know to be stabilized to the point where Iran will say Now is our chance you know to go in and wipe them out 
 and 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 since Khomeini died over there things have gotten a little more normalized
 Not quite as radical a stance more moderates are in power now
 Yeah 
 Put in the middle
 And yet so many of the citizens are the the Lebanese Who were hoping this would evolve into a war against Israel And trying to connect with Israel all that time 
 and there really was no connection at all
 And but boy those Lebanese in Jordan they were saying you know this whole war is Israel's fault because Israel told the United States to attack Iran 
 it was like it was like you know Israel controls our government
 Right 
 but one thing I did learn was how deep the the hatred runs toward Israel by a lot of countries
 They just hate 
 anyway they can you know they can see to connect into something and hate it more 
 they just 
 I understand most of the land is now Israelis 
 they bought and actually purchased it and then and then moved in and started a country
 Right
 Yeah 
 right 
 right 
 and they both have holy sanctions
