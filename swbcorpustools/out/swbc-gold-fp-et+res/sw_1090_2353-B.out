 Well I know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years you know fr- their carefree years 
 but people that I have known that have done that like from other countries especially from Germany and Finland they are just they have such a better more mature outlook on life 
 and I think they're better people because of it 
 they're much more responsible 
 I know the church that I go to the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know
 they're encouraged to do that missionary work 
 and I be- I really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our society better
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Yeah
 <>
 Yes <>
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well I think so 
 it puts you out on your own 
 and and in a time after high school there's kind of a selfishness 
 teenagers in our country are kind of kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and and things like that 
 and I think that it would help people to become less self-centered and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to thinking less of your own needs but of other people
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 no
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 It would really 
 and I don't 
 the people that I've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are they do military service which you know I don't exactly recommend 
 but still they have benefited from it
 And you know although I wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily 
 but it's it has helped them 
 and they are just a lot more mature than the average student 
 and <> 
 Uh-huh
 Well that's right 
 A lot of people they flunk out 
 or they get they just get so excited to be away from home they just spend all there time partying 
 and they do a lot of things to themselves that that we really don't want our young people to be doing 
 and 
 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Be- 
 because we're so we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and having people <> 
 But you know our 
 like in our church it it is your free to do that or not
 you're encouraged to do it because you know it it helps you 
 and of course we think it's helping other people
 And so 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 And they're preoccupied with drinking
 Uh-huh 
 And 
 Uh-huh
 That's true <>
 That's really true
 Yeah 
 Well I I don't know how that would ever happen here 
 but at least 
 really
 Uh-huh
 
 Well I have seen a big change I think in high school kids that my relatives <> and friends that I know when I was in high school I had an idea of what I really wanted to do with what my what I was going to study 
 and at least I had some interest in 
 a lot of the youth that I come in contact with are they say I want to be a doctor I want to be a lawyer 
 Why 
 Because they make a lot of money
 And they don't have a goal 
 they don't have a goal 
 they don't have an interest in their own field of study
 They're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash
 Uh-huh
 Area Yes
 Yes
 There's just too many people
 Uh-huh
 That's right 
 Not enough people want to do that to for because of a service that they could provide
 You know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to be rich
 Uh-huh
 That's kind of sad 
 Well anyway 
 Well I guess I better go
 Well good luck to you 
 I enjoyed it
 Thanks 
 Bye-bye
