 Certainly
 
 Well I I tend to take two kinds of vacations the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that
 well I couldn't live without the family vacations 
 but my favorite is the the indulgent ones where we go off and and see places that have interested me since I was a kid for the most part 
 And 
 not anymore 
 They they've been in San Diego for the last few years 
 and they're moving to Florida
 And that's one of those things 
 you just have to go once a year
 So basically it it sorts out into that 
 and then once about once every three or four years I try to get over to England because I lived there for a while some years back
 Oh
 Beautiful country 
 Beautiful country
 beautiful people
 But 
 and I'd real really like to go because I'm fairly recently married 
 and and my husband has been hearing about these people for years 
 and but he's never met them 
 so I'd like I'd like to do that 
 But anyway that's that's our typical vacation 
 and we enjoy the family vacations 
 but the other ones are very special getaways 
 and we probably take one of each every year 
 How about yourself
 I've never been on a cruise
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 
 Well what do you do on a cruise 
 I've never been on a cruise
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 And where have you been on these cruises
 I see
 the the Mexican coast 
 That's all Mexico I think
 Where are you from originally
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yes
 Well I I grew up in Dallas 
 so it's not it's not like I'm going home 
 My my parents retired first to San Diego 
 and they're going now to Florida 
 and so they're going very nice places 
 thank God
 that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know 
 I really came to love San Diego and feel very comfortable there 
 They've been there eight years
 And you know I just grab the car and drive everywhere
 So it it is it is nice 
 but it's not home 
 This is home 
 and and I've never thought about a cruise 
 It's so funny
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 What's the best part from your point of view
 Uh-huh
 that will be nice
 sure
 Sure 
 Well go in don't go in the winter
 Oh
 Well th- there are exceptions made for special occasions like that
 But the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer 
 so 
 Well that sounds wonderful 
 I I guess I I would contemplate going on a cruise all circumstances permitting it
 Uh-huh
 How long are the cruises
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I tend when when I spend enough money to go overseas 
 I go for a long time
 that's interesting
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 
 That's really nice
 Uh-huh
 Well may maybe now things are calming down again That will happen
 Well that that's really great 
 as I said basically all I've done is go back and forth to parents 
 and 
 And and we had my husband had a conference in L A 
 so we spent a week in L A 
 and of course 
 I'm I'm I'm very unusual 
 I like
