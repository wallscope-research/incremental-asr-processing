 Okay 
 now you can tell me what you do
 Uh-huh
 great
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well the one John works for seems to have a l- you know good benefits 
 and the pay is decent
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 
 Great 
 I had I had a granddaughter 
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 Do you have major medical benefits
 That that helps some 
 if 
 it depends on what your deductible is how high it is
 Each person
 Yeah 
 that's pretty har- that's pretty high 
 Right
 That's that's right
 And five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical too
 Yeah 
 I know where my daughter works 
 now she she 
 course we live in a a rural sort of setting
 and where she works she has no benefits at all
 And her wage is not not very good 
 But it's it's the type of area we live in 
 Of course living expenses aren't as bad either though which makes a difference
 Well she has to pay for it herself
 you know they have to pay for their own insurance 
 But 
 well from what I've seen 
 from my aunt and uncle really from Florida up to here 
 they're not that much different
 Uh-huh
 Is that right
 Uh-huh
 Wow 
 that's a big difference
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 should be
 Yes Uh-huh
 And it would be much more convenient 
 Yeah
 it would be more convenient too
 yeah
 My other daughter works and has 
 they have to take their two children to day care you know
 And it it's 
 I don't know how they do it 
 I really don't You know 
 getting them there and then and going to work and then picking them up and all the preparations
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I don't know 
 I think those benefits you mentioned sometimes they're even more important than you- the wage itself
 If you can get those benefits even 
 they they come out to much a much better benefit than than an increase in your wage a lot of times
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah 
 it would make it a lot better
 Uh-huh
 well and if it was there you would really have a little more knowledge on what's going on probably you know with your child
 Right
 Yeah
 Right 
 yeah
 I don't know 
 my daughter one daughter works for M C I 
 and they don't they where she works they don't have anything like that
 Pittsburgh
 Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 so they were very flexible
 and that that would be great 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 They say you're going to do it this way and that's the way it's going to be
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah
 True 
 well that's true in any any company I think
 I've I've never well I can't say I've never 
 I've maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the ho- you know out of the home 
 but the rest of the time I've been an Avon lady and a lady
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Usually consultants make very good income
 Is that right
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 A consultant really is should be more knowledgeable than everybody else you know
 so it stands to reason they should really ha- have more benefits
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 and they'll do it
