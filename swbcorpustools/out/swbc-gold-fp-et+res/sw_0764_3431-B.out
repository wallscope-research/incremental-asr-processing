 Well we remodeled a bathroom And which required completely repainting the bathroom 
 and the other project we've done around here is we've remodeled all our all our closets which required quite a bit of painting
 No 
 we did it ourselves 
 did it myself 
 Yeah
 Is this a project you did yourself
 What what brought about the fading of the paint
 Just sun exposure
 okay 
 yeah
 Latex paint
 Latex
 Uh-huh
 On the ceiling
 Yeah
 No 
 that's true
 Did you go what kind of paint did you use on the ceiling
 Okay
 Uh-huh
 Seems like I've we've done some remodeling of some rental houses that we have
 and it appears as though that in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built they used a lot of semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints
 and that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints it seemed like 
 We had an occasion where we had to do some sealing of the se- of the this type of paint before we could paint it
 Yeah
 Right
 You had pretty good luck with one coat type paint 
 You use a particular brand or anything
 Weather beater type stuff
 Yeah
 Understand
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it's a lot like wall paper 
 That's true
 Well the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath 
 so we didn't have a problem with that
 I have had I've have never experienced that type of a problem with a latex paint
 So you shouldn't have a you shouldn't have a problem with it
 They're they're pretty well refined today a lot of the paints 
 and Sears is one of the better ones
 I've used many a gallon of them myself
 used oil base paints for trim you know like around doors and and on doors things like that
 primarily because it it seems to be a little more well let's say 
 well not so much that 
 It seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings as opposed to a latex type paint
 And it just you know it it gives you a a variance even though it's the same color
 So it's worked out pretty well for us
 quite a bit 
 painted a couple of houses 
 recently this summer we painted a out building which is a shed that we have on the
