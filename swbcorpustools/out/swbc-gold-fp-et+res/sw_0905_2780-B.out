 Uh-huh 
 Well now you you say two different parts of the country 
 what are are are you referring to yourself 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 well of course you talk gun controls down here in Texas 
 and you're asking to be lynched
 Uh-huh 
 Well it's very true 
 now I'm a New Yorker by birth
 Although I claim Florida as my home now 
 I have two sons living down there 
 but I also have two sons living elsewhere one in Tennessee one in Mississippi 
 But I lived in Te- in Florida for ten years 
 and I kind of like it down there 
 but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far
 I think 
 well in your words they were a little bit too liberal 
 they p- they I believe if I'm correct I believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons
 But they sh- quickly did away with it
 I think in the next session they they modified it 
 but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in Florida
 The the one week seven day the delay 
 Uh huh
 Well I don't mind that too much 
 I'm I'm with the N R A myself
 And Really the only objection we have Is you you give a little 
 and next thing you know somebody's trying to take more
 Yeah
 Well then tell me 
 do you consider yourself a liberal 
 Well let me ask you this then
 How is your what is your feeling about expressing yourself by burning the American flag
 
 Well now wait a minute the- there 
 you just said it
 It's their right by freedom of speech 
 What does speech have to do with burning a flag
 Now Well I I still go back to 
 Then would you condone the burning of the capitol building
 then you don't draw a line between public property and what a public symbol
 yeah
 but here again I go back to the second amendment 
 You can disagree by s- b- freedom of speech which has nothing to do with action
 Now I am I am adamantly against that
 Uh-huh 
 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 No
 Uh-huh
 Well here again we 
 even though you physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself
 Nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country
 so long as it's their possession 
 Ok you're you're that's fine up to there except that th- what that flag symbolizes is is this country
 and I used to know as a Boy Scout 
 but all I remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country and to maintain it 
 And to me that's black eye to every man that ever p- carried a weapon or killed for his country
 Uh-huh
 It's It's very easy to do
 
 Uh-huh
 Well I think it should be permitted under certain circus- circumstances Uh-huh
 
 Well tell me
 has it ever been decided when when is a fetus a human
 
 Or they 
 on their o- within the own society it can vary
 Uh-huh
