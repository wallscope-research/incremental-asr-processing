 Okay 
 Have you done this very long 
 Yeah 
 that's the same with us 
 Well what kind of car would you buy 
 Oh okay 
 O- 
 Uh-huh 
 Okay 
 What kind do you have now 
 Oh okay 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Oh uh-huh 
 And did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic
 Uh-huh 
 Oh really 
 We've always bought American made cars mostly Oldsmobiles
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 we've been real pleased with ours 
 I think we've had one two three 
 and most 
 we have a Cutlass we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like a seventy-seven
 Then we have a Cutlass Sierra 
 and we've had the ninety-eight
 So 
 but I don't know 
 we'll we're going to be in the market for a car probably in the next year 
 and the financing is always something we consider you know the four percent or when they give good financing through the the motor company 
 But I don't know what we're going to buy 
 I always thought I would like to try a foreign made car 
 but boy with all the auto workers being laid off makes me feel guilty 
 So 
 Oh 
 Oh the 
 Ooh boy 
 I'll bet it was hard to part with that 
 Oh 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh
