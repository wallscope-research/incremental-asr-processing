 Well ho- how do you view this whole subject
 Are you one who feels like you have have benefited from the change in in roles in women 
 Or or what do you think
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 yes 
 I think so
 Are you are you someone who works outside your home 
 or have you 
 yes
 well have there been significant changes do you think in the employment place ex- especially say at T I
 Have has anything in particular changed that you have noticed During your time there
 Yeah 
 uh-huh 
 What what kind of work do you do
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yes 
 yes
 Yes 
 yes 
 in years past I know in fact even even the word drafter has changed
 because it used to be they were draftsman 
 Right
 Maybe not 
 Well I when I was in college 
 I graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixty-four
 And I was a math major which was a real rarity among women at that time
 So I was in a lot of classes where there I was either the only girl or you know one of just a very few women in the class
 So that was a change 
 and even I did not use my math in my work 
 I I became a technical writer
 But even so there were very very few women in technical writing
 But that has changed a lot
 In recent years it has just really really changed a lot
 And and I think that you know the one thing that I have seen is that more and more women are getting into management
 but I think they have got a long way to go 
 There was something on T V the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the heads of chairmen of the board chair- chair persons if you sa- if you will of the board are women in this country
 And I thought that you know that's pretty si- a pretty significantly small number
 So there are some some strides to be made there
 But I do not know 
 I I think we have come a long way actually when I think about you know when things were like even when I you know just when I was in high school and how it is now for girls
 And I guess [ [ my I the one ] + my one ] bad thing is that I am that I wish my mother had had some of those opportunities because I think she would have really she rea- would have succeeded in a lot of ways that men that women were not able to succeed in her generation
 So anyway Do you have children
 I was going to say do you have daughters 
 That's always a good question
 Yes 
 In fact I have a daughter who is in a a who just graduated in civil engineering from college
 So she is pretty much although there were some other women in her class she was you know one of the minorities females in the class
 So she definitely entering into a male profession
 But But you know for instance there are there is the organization women the Society of Women Engineers
 so that is recognized as you know a place where women should be
 But I do not know 
 I you see it in also in like in church where more and more women are becoming ministers In you know in protestant congregations 
 and it will be interesting to see if if Roman Catholicism ever recognizes women in in the role of priest 
 I do- I do not know if you are Roman Catholic or you know what you know about that
 I am not either 
 but that is one area where it that I can see might change but I really doubt will change 
 No 
 probably not 
 Huh-uh
 So how about what in particular would you think that women still other than the work place where women still are being you know found wanting you know or not re- as highly regarded as men would be 
 I was just trying to think 
 I know something
 Maybe you could te- 
 what do you think that what do you think tell me what you think about this
 The the the role of women in combat roles during the war
 Because I know that there now there they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles
 And the only branch in the armed fo- services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force 
 And I spoke because women were filing flying missions into you know for whatever reason into in the Persian Gulf war
 And so But I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job
 It was real interesting 
 they were I was listening to some of the comments on ra- television the other day about it 
 and one of one of the men who was a 
 I do not know if he was a general or you know what his rank was very high
 He said it's just a personal thing with me 
 I can not be real you know I can not tell you why I feel this way 
 but I just would rather have a man doing some of these jobs than a woman 
 I thought well at least he was honest 
 But that does not sit very well with a lot of folks I am sure 
 Yeah 
 right 
 You know Neil well Neil as far as I am concerned {A and I could be wrong about this } but the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength to do something
 because I would think I think you know mentally and emotionally I think women can handle a job and every bit as well 
 So anyway it's still <> 
 Sure
 No 
 I would not either 
 No 
 I agree
 but I am sure that there are women who would would relish that you know kind of job 
 So I guess that should be taken into consideration as well
 So well this is an interesting topic
 I have you know I have 
 having a daughter who has gone into this into engineering I sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than I did 
 She's a lot more forthright about her opinions and a little more assertive than I think I was 
 So that's that's progress I guess 
 Well I have enjoyed talking with you Lisa 
 and have you talked with a lot of people in this project 
 or 
 Yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 well that's great 
 that's good
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well 
 Yeah 
 well that's good 
 that's good 
 because I I guess I placed all but one or two of my calls And only because I going to make some money 
 see we our choir is doing this as a money ma- raising project
 We we got the connection through a T I church member
 And so we are doing it to raise money for a large project at church
 and so I feel like this is one way I can contribute that's not too painful Financially painful anyway
 It's just real nice that way 
 so I thought well I will just get on the stick and do it
 Well I will say good-bye to you
 but I have enjoyed the conversation
 Thank you
 Bye-bye
