 Okay
 Well I think that it it varies on on the individual basis
 sometimes it is there is no alternative
 you do not have family available or family that's 
 you may not even have family that is in you know who are around 
 So sometimes it's not an alternative
 And I think but I think also sometimes it can be a benefit if it's for a short time 
 Sometimes in a nursing home 
 especially if if it's after an acute illness 
 To get over a 
 or to rehab after an illness
 Sometimes you know sometimes the nursing homes are good for just short periods of time
 Uh-huh
 Because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them out much faster than what they're really able to
 So so there is some good to it
 sometimes too it's used as a dumb job 
 You know the fam- well the families do not necessarily know what to do with them 
 and they don't want to take the responsibility 
 so they will put them in a nursing home
 So you see 
 there's both sides to it too 
 What do you think 
 Yeah
 That's true
 I think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to 
 it's there's not a choice it's because it's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home
 So that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the either Medicare or insurance to cover it
 So 
 Yeah 
 and then there's also some that are set up for specialties
 I know some 
 Unfortunately some elderly have to go to have I guess it's Alzheimer's or where they wonder or or confused or have some mental problem 
 And you need a special nursing home for that 
 You need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around
 and you need people who are trained for that type of problem
 Yeah 
 so so there's different types of nursing homes I think
 Uh-huh
 Gives her a little bit of her own independence
 but she still has a security there
 That's right 
 and I I've seen some of them like that too 
 and also they have a lot of activities going on for the ones who are more active
 So it's not sort of like a sick place
 Yeah 
 I I think I think the I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the elderly person who's going in and the family that's going to be effec- effected by it
 and you know sometimes it can those choi- those choices can be made in advance 
 and sometimes the choices because of the nature of the illness when they're
