 Okay 
 what do you think is the biggest problem
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Is it the do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the values they get from home
 Right
 Yeah 
 I I I I think that the biggest problem is with the with the home environment being part of it 
 You know if 
 I think too many parents expect the school to teach the moral aspects of of things to the st- to the kids and you know while we're not going to worry about teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then expect them to pick it up at school 
 you're not going to do that you know 
 you're going to carry carry with carry to school out into the world you know what you learned at home 
 and I think that that part of that showing up now you know with with things because kids I think have probably less respect than for for people than in in other things than we may have seen in the past 
 and part of it's the the family I think 
 and part of it's the living conditions of certain people are subjected too 
 drugs is a big problem now 
 and I think that's that's that's another root problem
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Right
 Well I think it's like you say it's it's the socioeconomic mix 
 there you know the they're 
 you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids who are basically that might be more well to- well off you know going to a private Catholic school or whatever 
 and and they're not all that way 
 but you know some that are that they're they're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city you know public schools
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well you know in a lot of cases like that where you know if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it's it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education It shows I think it shows that the parents have some desire for for the kid to do do well you know 
 and that may be passed on down to the kid as well 
 and maybe they pick up on that
 And then from the other aspect maybe the school itself has has has more emphasis on trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller 
 they may be able to to give the resources that's needed to to do a good job
 that's a tough question how to fix the school system 
 with 
 I would try to I guess to see about getting parents more involved with try to to come up with more ways to do that stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students and more more classes that I think that are 
 and I think this is happening some around the country in terms of morals trying to teach the kinds of things that that aren't getting taught at home and and and respect for other people 
 I think that's a big part of it 
 You know people you know 
 if you don't care about property and people you know you're not going to care about about learning I think You know 
 you're not going to really care about yourself
 Right
 Well you know and I 
 that's not an ea- but that's not an easy task you know 
 that's why I say it's it's a tough question what would you do 
 + ] because you know even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when when when you're growing up in you know in a home which may be just the pits 
 and you don't have any any kind of a good environment to live in you know
 it's kind of hard to say well you need to take care of other people's stuff as well when you're when you barely have anything yourself 
 So 
 I could see where that would be a problem 
 and I think that's I think it's
