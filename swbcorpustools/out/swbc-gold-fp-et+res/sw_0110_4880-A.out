 Well yeah 
 I I'm employed by a company that does do random drug testing 
 and I've got some very definite opinions about it you know which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions from from when they when they announced it But developed a little more I guess but haven't changed that much 
 What about you 
 Are you in- involved at all
 Yes
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 It that's that's mine 
 It it you know 
 I I go back 
 it to me no matter how much the th- our company claims it's not a constitutional issue That because this is between a company and an employee it is not it is not a government 
 it's not 
 the Constitution doesn't apply 
 But I it it seems to me that it still should 
 I I our company's doing it because they're a government contractor 
 and so it's it's required for certain + some form some form of drug program is required ] to get the government contracts 
 and I'd I'd *[[slash error]] Yes 
 Okay 
 An- and our company has taken that and gone all the way 
 Say 
 okay 
 first off we don't we don't have enough courage to pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage because that would offend them if they if they weren't 
 So we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even 
 and and 
 then 
 but and they 
 so it's a a complete random testing 
 w- well it's random in the sense that you don't know when 
 It is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested
 and you know I I sit at a terminal and and write software all day 
 It it certainly has no life threatening capabilities you know in in my job 
 And and yes 
 I I agree that there are there are jobs that are definitely life threatening 
 and and and th- there needs to be a line drawn somewhere at rea- reasonable and proper 
 I- you know 
 Well 
 Yeah 
 I that that I that I will give credit to to our our company for in that that I think there's there's a couple of levels of tests in terms of of of drugs 
 And e- e- essentially the first thing is t- is on the order of paper in the urine and or some you know 
 it's not quite that simple 
 but it's fairly simple
 Coarse kind of test 
 And then there's a a much more refined test spectrography or whatever it's called The chemo- chemotography to determine exactly what the what the things are 
 And 
 No 
 I I've been with this company for for sixteen years now
 And 
 No 
 And it and it and it has it has you know 
 they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody 
 And I at that time I could justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't you don't know 
 But on the other hand someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test
