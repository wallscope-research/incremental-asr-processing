 Well I definitely think that we need to start recycling 
 I think it has got to be an individual responsibility until 
 I think if we wait which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it is going to be to late 
 I have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand
 And that is not too far away 
 but I don't know how it is there 
 It is very difficult here even if you care like I do to do much 
 I take my paper 
 I can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store
 and I can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them 
 and there are some fire stations I can take newspapers to 
 and that is very inconvenient cause I have to wait until I have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 It is real hard to find a spot 
 and then I don't know if you note even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible 
 bottles 
 glass 
 that cannot be it could be recycled 
 but there is no place to 
 No 
 We have a pilot program in Arlington going on I think in the north part of the city where they are have people people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out
 And I think that is what it is going to have to come to Where we are just forced to 
 Yeah
 I think so 
 just because they have to You know
 Right 
 uh-huh 
 And I think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the 
 it's It's trouble for me to do what I do
 I am willing to do it 
 but 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 It is very difficult 
 Like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers 
 and so I don't know 
 I think there needs to be more places 
 and also I have a real strong opinion 
 In Iowa the state I am from I believe it has gone up to a dollar now 
 Every time you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay ten cents for it
 and then you take it back to the store 
 and you get it back
 You are forced to 
 And you also don't see the litter there 
 People just 
 It makes it worthwhile to take it back 
 and I've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian 
 I don't know if you've tried it
 and they have on the ba- it's five cents that they pay five cents 
 and it even shows the states that 
 Yeah 
 Well on- some of them are five some are ten cents 
 I am looking at it right now
 Texas is not one of them see 
 So I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass
 Uh-huh
 Do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper
 Good 
 Because there is a lot of waste there isn't there
 Right
 Right
 Right
 Yeah
 Something else I think we do can do is support companies that encourage 
 like I have decided Downy Fabric Softener now has where you can buy a little carton
 you add wa- 
 well I image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later 
 but I am going to stick with Downey because they were first
 And I want them to have my business 
 And I think packaging could be done much better 
 There is so much plastic 
 But 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 And I think that it's just people have got to be aware 
 Unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care 
 and they don't want to think about it
 And I just look at it I don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something 
 You know I want to feel like I at least tried
 And I don't know 
 It just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it 
 Then we will be forced to 
 It may be too late
 Very little 
 That's another thing that 
 see there were no 
 I know Amway 
 I use a couple of things from Amway that it says this is burnable material 
 Well that doesn't do me any good because I don't have any place to burn it
 Yeah 
 And then just like the glass bottles that it says on the bottle I can get ten cents but not in Texas
 And there is no place I can take glass to
 So I still throw away a lot of glass
 Yeah 
 And then the packaging thing really grips me 
 You buy some 
 and it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic
