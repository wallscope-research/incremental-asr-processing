 Wondering how you keep up on the news 
 Uh-huh
 I guess the I get the WASHINGTON POST
 and that is a pretty big newspaper 
 and I think that's almost exclusive mely my first of the news 
 Though I have the radio on when I go to work I don't think the news usually hits 
 because I'm not going right on the hour
 You know
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I think that you know we we've resolved the issue 
 and that's what we were asked to do
 Right
 Right
 okay 
 Well thanks for discussing it
 Bye-bye
