 Yeah
 Well I've had them where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people
 and I had help with them 
 and part of them I did were like a buffet
 and it 
 I had just different side dishes and appetizers 
 and one of them that that I'd remembered was some sausage hors d'oeuvres 
 and anyhow you take a couple of cups of Bisquick and sausage like a a Owens mild 
 you can I guess you could use the hot if you wanted to
 Yeah
 And you put that in 
 and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy 
 and then like I just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes
 and they are so good
 Yeah 
 It's making me hungry for them right now
 Have you
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 I I've used that quite a bit 
 and it and it seems to work real well
 
 And when I've had so many people t- to feed like I try to do a ham and a turkey 
 and and 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 No 
 What 
 Uh-huh
 I'll bet
 Yeah
 I'll have to try that
 I like things that are easy and and nutritious
 Uh-huh
 I know
 I know 
 Well 
 Thank God for microwaves you know
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 well I don't anymore 
 Y- it's been a few years 
 and and I don't have you know over a couple either 
 and and I try to have everything all ready 
 and and it it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't s- spend all my time in the kitchen
 And Spaghetti 
 and 
 Yeah
 I know 
 I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't
 Yeah
 yeah
 I like it too
 I do too
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well have you had any good ideas yet
 okay
 Yeah
 Yeah
 And that's the way to do it too
 I think it's you know what's I think is so nice is that in this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you 
 and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen
 And And it makes an awful lot of difference doesn't it
 Well
