 Well credit cards 
 I'll tell you what I I can't say a whole lot about credit cards because I tore mine up
 Yeah 
 I got in some problems with financial problems because of credit cards 
 so I basically just got rid of all of them
 I I have a a couple 
 I have a gas card that I that I use just for gas and you know one that I use just for emergencies 
 but 
 Yeah
 I know it
 Uh-huh
 is that right
 That's a that's a good policy
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 sometimes I wish I had them 
 but in most cases I'm glad I don't because I you know unfortunately I I I don't have the control you have 
 I wish I did 
 but but I don't 
 and it you know it 
 I just don't want to get into that situation again 
 so we'll 
 that's it 
 See and that's 
 even with my gas card you know I find that I'll go in to get some gas 
 and I'll end up buying you know candy and drinks and you know sweets and whatever 
 and then at the end of the month I you know I get a bill 
 and I'm thinking what did I get that costs so much
 And 
 Yeah 
 that that's true 
 but I can I can under- certainly understand where 
 You know 
 yeah
 Isn't it 
 that's unbelievable 
 How 
 let me ask you this 
 How how old are you
 Thirty-three
 Okay
 You'll be thirty-three this year
 You want to be thirty-two as long as you can 
 It's coming
 Yeah 
 I I know what you mean about the interest rates It's it's unbelievable
 Uh-huh
 jeez
 Yeah 
 and then you bet
 That's 
 yeah 
 I in fact I've I've even heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less rates and have paid off their you know higher interest rate cards and just sent them back you know 
 And I I guess there's some there's some negotiating there too
 because I heard 
 on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is call you know 
 if you've got a pretty good rating credit rating you can call your in- you know your your card wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my you know annual fees or I'll just go to somewhere else
 You know and if you've got if you've got a pretty good history with them they're more than willing to do that
 Yeah 
 in fact that's that's what this guy 
 you know he wrote a book on it 
 and he says that's you know he's tried it sev- with several of his cards
 and he's just told them you know I I can get this card from this bank at this rate 
 and yours is at you know eighteen or nineteen percent
 It does not make sense for me to do that 
 and if you won't drop my rates I'll just go ahead and send you back your card 
 and I'll go somewhere else and get it
 Uh-huh
