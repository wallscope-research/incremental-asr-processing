 So have you got a pet
 Yeah
 That's right 
 that's like unconditional affection
 Yeah
 I had a cat 
 I've had several cats 
 My pet was hit by a car New Year's Eve 
 but 
 I'm going to get another one as soon as I get back in town 
 I'm going out of town this weekend 
 when I get back I'm going to find a cat 
 So 
 Yeah
 Ye- 
 I work and go to school 
 and it's kind of nice 
 tha- 
 you come home your your pet's there for you and s- wants a little food a little attention
 And that's 
 it's kind of fun 
 <> Yeah
 No 
 it was an in- kind of indoor outdoor 
 it it was 
 well yeah 
 I don't I don't care for the smell of the litter box 
 so my cat was trained to go outside 
 other than that it was inside when it wanted to be it was outside when 
 Yeah 
 I I think you know 
 I like dogs 
 but I think that 
 I'm 
 kind of like big do- big dogs 
 and you have to have room for them
 And dogs take a lot of a lot more care than cats do 
 Cats are pretty independent you know 
 you feed them 
 and they keep themselves clean 
 and if you if you raise them right you know you don't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and things like that
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I got to take care of a friend of mine's dog 
 He's just got a puppy 
 and he was out of town last weekend 
 and of course the dog is not trained for anything yet 
 so it was go over there and clean up after the dog 
 and that's that's a major chore you know if you don't if you don't keep up with it
 And kids kind of 
 they want the they want the fun part and not the not the work
 Yeah
 Well if you're if you're going to have a pet and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to you know deal with the consequences take care of the offspring 
 and and I think you know 
 when I was growing up we had cats 
 and you know just seeing the cats you know the the miracle of birth you know put that in quotes is tha- that's a that's a neat thing to to experience as a kid and understand
 and and it was a real positive thing 
 but on the other hand you don't want to you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road you know
 th- they're they're getting old now 
 and it's time to get rid of them
 So 
 Yeah
 Okay 
 well good talking to you 
 Bye
