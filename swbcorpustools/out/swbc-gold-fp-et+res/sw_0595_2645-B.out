 Yes
 Well let's see 
 what kind of hobbies do I have 
 I guess I it's more not so much a hobby but things I enjoy doing 
 I enjoy playing basketball and and basically all kinds of sports 
 And 
 Excuse me
 No 
 not not really 
 no 
 I'm really not too creative 
 well I you know around with my hands and things like that 
 I leave that more up to my Mom 
 yeah
 well let's hope that you you aren't employed by that craft for too long
 Uh-huh
 Wh- what kind of time frame is it looking for the different shifts up there
 Is it 
 basically I had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it Texas
 wow 
 Uh-huh 
 Wow 
 how about that 
 Yeah 
 that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney
 How about that 
 Well that's that's unfortunate 
 is there many other 
 are you in the defense
 Is it many other corporations in the area
 Well I'm sure with the new aw- contract awarding 
 I I think it went to Lockheed didn't it
 That I hear they're hiring all over the place for that
 really 
 Now is that ad good just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs
 How about that
 Uh-huh
 Well you in the computer operations or in the actual manufacturing
 Right 
 yeah 
 that's why I was in the Deseg down here in Plano also
 Am I still employed by T I 
 no 
 I took a leave of of T I back in November
 Actually December was my first month away from them
 Exempt
 It unfortunately I guess for myself it wasn't it was purely by my own choice 
 It wasn't there was no incentive for myself to leave 
 but it was just an opportunity arose 
 and decided to take it
 No 
 I should have taken the the the you know option when that was there 
 but it was just I missed it by a couple months 
 But you know what can one do 
 I'm just happy still to have a job
 Yeah 
 I am kind of happy with it 
 it's getting better all the time 
 I knew it would be different from the very beginning 
 but you know as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system 
 so I was in the computer operations 
 it's you know it all starts to become similar 
 there's you know there's benefits 
 and there's things that weren't as good
 but as an overall package I'd say I'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 Well the one thing I guess at least in your favor is the the fact that that is more in the support of the manufacturing 
 and there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the de- the defense area but manufacturing in general 
 Uh-huh 
 That's great 
 That's good
 Uh-huh 
 Sure 
 yeah 
 Sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table
 It may be a blessing in disguise 
 I know a number of people who are surplused 
 and they're just 
 actually what the positions that they found outside of the company were much much better than the ones that they currently had inside
 Exactly 
 Uh-huh 
 well I'm sure it's just with [ [ the the the ] + the ] way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you dec- decide on a pass 
 Uh-huh 
 Well would you like to be there
 Uh-huh
 Sure 
 Uh-huh 
 Well just take the day 
 Well actually the the Plano Dallas Houston you know Austin that whole area is is actually quite quite nice
 that's a beautiful place
 Uh-huh 
 That's just fantastic down there 
 Take it more as a 
 this is your opportunity to do whatever you want 
 pick out where you want to live 
 and then once you pick that spot out pick out what you want to do
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that's a 
 it it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well the best thing about it is that you can try something 
 if you don't like it shoot move on to something else 
 That's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here 
 I'll take a chance 
 if I don't like it I'll go someplace else do something different
 Five years
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I can imagine you know the longer and longer it goes 
 Uh-huh
 Well that's good 
 you've got a good attitude about it
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 there you go 
 That's the way to do it
 There you go 
 that's the thing to do 
 That's much funner than doing any kind of job
 That will work out just fine
 All right 
 nice talking to you
 Good-bye
