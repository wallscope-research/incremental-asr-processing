 Well I was just trying to think 
 When they called I didn't have as much time to prepare for this as I did some of the others 
 I love watching some of the new new shows basically
 And we to- we subscribe to C N N 
 and we took that 
 and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake 
 and I have gotten stuck on a lot of this 
 The new shows and the stuff that comes on that that it you know 
 like the at night the discussion talk shows and things 
 And we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here
 We have little ones 
 we do let them watch NINE ONE ONE
 and we think that's kind of informative to teach them how to handle things in situations
 What do you watch
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 That's the same thing we do
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that kind that's the kind I like really more than the sitcoms 
 I haven't gotten into many of those 
 I have heard that's real good
 That's Burt Reynolds isn't it
 Yeah 
 I've heard that 
 Now someone told me that 
 and also I meant to be trying to pick up on MURPHY BROWN because they said that that was really good this season
 You've got to yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night too 
 I don't even know 
 okay 
 Now I we've never even seen that
 Uh-huh 
 On the others 
 Well you know on Friday nights especially we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY
 Or 
 It's kind of a competition on Thursdays between PRIME TIME and KNOTS LANDING
 But we used to like KNOTS LANDING a lot 
 excuse me just a minute <> 
 <> The money is right there on the thing and the coupon
 I know 
 That's the thing 
 And so we 
 Uh-huh 
 Well they are 
 In fact on weeknights they are in bed by eight 
 but we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off
 Yeah 
 he has gone to get it
 Thank you 
 but I was to say on Saturdays there is absolutely nothing 
 and that's the day my husband wants to 
 No 
 but I saw that advertised today 
 and it sounds like it's not fluff 
 It sounds like it's good
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that's what they said it was kind of a little more drama to it
 Well and a- and another one now that it's getting darker 
 and you are wanting to cocoon more 
 that they said is excellent is the I'LL FLY AWAY and BROOKLYN BRIDGE 
 Some of these that are nostalgic 
 Did you like it
 Did you 
 Well they said that one and I'LL FLY AWAY are really quality you know 
 and 
 I haven't seen it either 
 I think what I need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then I get my bath it's you know it's almost too late to start something new 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights
 So it's like we are kind of tuned out of our T V 
 Yeah 
 well we do too
 Yeah 
 I don't know 
 yeah 
 There's a lot more to do with with your time when you get into it 
 Uh-huh 
 Well my my sister and them and her husband do on weekends 
 They don't have children yet 
 and they just turn it on when they walk in 
 they turn it off when they leave
 So they are used to that too 
 Yeah 
 I understand 
 Same here 
 Yeah 
 it's real good 
 And then of course in the afternoons if I get in from work in time I watch OPRAH some of those you know talk shows 
 I like her
 Yeah
 Well it's it's nice talking to you 
 I guess we've kind of exhausted this one 
 but it's nice talking with you
 Thank you
 Bye-bye
