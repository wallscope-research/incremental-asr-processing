 Okay 
 why do you think it sounds 
 do you think we should adopt it
 You don't
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Yeah 
 I I agree with you 
 I don't think we should either even though I know there are benefits to the metric system 
 I don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the the disadvantages that would happen to the people in America
 and also the 
 I don't know 
 it seems almost like there's this it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we'll look good to the other nations 
 because I think they that's an area that the other nations especially Europe look down on us like we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who haven't really attained it yet 
 And I feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us 
 And it's like hey we're content with this 
 No 
 it's probably not as accurate 
 probably you know intellectually doesn't 
 it's not as sound intellectually but like you said come on 
 I had six years of college 
 and I don't know the metric system and I don't care to learn it
 and I'm not some kind of an idiot 
 I just 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 There's a lot of people 
 like you're educated 
 I'm educated 
 my husband is 
 but a lot of people are flat not educated 
 and if I have a hard time you know putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college 
 or I don't know how much of the you know 
 but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they don't have any college probably much at all 
 and if we can't take it and use it easily well how can you put that on like elderly people and you know just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as as much sharpness and ment- mental acuity
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I think it failed too 
 because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous 
 The thing Americans have so much stress on them right now
 if you look at the average family it's like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this 
 It's like come on let's take the pressure
 Yeah 
 and it's just like another thing
 the American family doesn't need any more pressure 
 Just leave them alone 
 let them measure their drinking water in cups 
 and leave them alone 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 That's 
 And and if they don't like the way we do it just get off our don't worry about it And I think 
 Right 
 it is
 because it is another language 
 yeah
 That's funny 
 Well that's good 
 I think we kept it at real good
 Is that all we need to say
 You too 
 I think that was good
 That was the best one 
 Usually I get distracted off the topic 
 You know what I mean
 And we'll end up one man was telling me about his grandfather in Lithuania 
 and we were talking about something tot- income tax or something
 And I just 
 Anyway I appreciate it 
 Have a good day
