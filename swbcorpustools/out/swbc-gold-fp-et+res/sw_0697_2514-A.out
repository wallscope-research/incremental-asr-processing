 Okay 
 Dee are you familiar with the Latin American policies
 Really 
 yeah 
 it's not mine either 
 but I know I know our policy 
 like in Nicaragua I am familiar with that because we have some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border 
 and they are missionaries there 
 and they they live there 
 and they have to travel by boat forty-five minutes to get to their car and stuff 
 and I know that they helped a lot of those Sandanistas refugees coming across the border 
 and they housed them and stuff 
 They have been down there about three years now 
 and they wrote that it's kind of weird 
 they have bats in their roof 
 but the bats eat the bad spiders 
 so they leave the bats you know 
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I think their policy with them that though is 
 I don't know 
 I think 
 I wish we would have just 
 I'm not that up on the policy of ways 
 I know that's kind of old 
 but I don't know 
 I just I'm glad that the Sandanistas aren't in power anymore because I think that they were very wicked And probably some of the biggest drug dealers that the world has probably ever seen 
 and I feel like most of the leaders in Latin America are probably 
 you would be safe to say that they were just very very you know big into drugs
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 they need to have more checks and balances in their government to get rid of the corruption But I think first though 
 I don't know 
 they need to I think they need the repentance on the leadership of the different nations for all their you know the atrocities that they commit and the drug dealings and in the just in the drug crimes 
 because I feel like a lot of the leadership in those nations are so engrossed in the drug crimes that until they repent or they are moved from power that you know 
 because there are so many of them that the next one to come up if you just knock one off and then have another one 
 and I know a lot of those nations there's Brazil I know is like forty percent evangelical Christian Not just go to church but you know really on fire for God 
 and they are just surpassing America Latin America by the drugs 
 You know it's just incomprehensible 
 and so I just think that I think that God is going to honor that and that he is going to put in some good leadership 
 and I know the president of I believe Costa Rica is a Christian 
 And he goes to no Guatemala because he goes to virgo church in Guatemala City 
 The church is in real close relationship with him 
 And he is a former president of Guatemala 
 He's an elder at virgo church 
 and you know that that God is doing something 
 and he is raising up some leaders 
 and the people want him back as president bad 
 but they have a rule in Guatemala that he can't have another term 
 and so the the people are trying to override that not just the Christians but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority the people rejoice
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 I know that Costa Rica they don't allow anybody to come that to come any what do you call what do you call immigrants 
 They don't allow anything like that 
 like I could not go to Costa Rica and live as an American citizen 
 They would not permit me to live there to work 
 They wouldn't 
 Their jobs are there for Costa Ricans 
 They don't allow people to move in like less nations you know
 take the job 
 No 
 they don't take any 
 I couldn't even go there 
 My husband had to receive all this special permission to go 
 so even with you know in inner company you know transfer or something 
 and I have another friend in Costa Rica that 
 she was born there 
 She's Costa Rican 
 I guess I do know a little bit 
 I went to Mexico City one time and stayed 
 I have been there twice and stayed 
 and that aw that was just really sad 
 But a lot of it though is their debt 
 I think that we should not loan them anymore money 
 that if we still want to give them money give them money quit loaning it to them 
 You're not going to get it back 
 Don't be indebted to anybody 
 Don't be the loaner or borrower 
 It's just not good 
 We need to if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them 
 but quit loaning all the money out 
 Which I don't think we are loaning anymore now 
 but that's how we got into a problem 
 If we got the 
 we have we went in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars 
 That's common sense 
 you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 
 Yeah 
 we we are it's like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money 
 that was really stupid on our part to even loan it to them 
 You don't loan money to people like that 
 you feel like you need to give them something to help them out fine 
 but you don't go making billions of dollars of loans in to people that you can just look at the situation
 Yeah 
 and know that they are going to be capable of paying us back 
 and that puts a bondage on them 
 It makes you know pressure on the nation and on the people and on the leadership and makes their inflation go up 
 and it's just a big mess
 No 
 but I knew people 
 I was there before that 
 but I knew people 
 I got a letter from a friend of mine that I had met there that who who the apartment building was destroyed 
 and they were living in a tent 
 so it's kind of weird you know 
 To these people who were on U S dive the Mexican diving we went to the pool together and watched them dive and all this 
 so they were you know just normal people weren't squatters or poor people or anything that 
 I did I knew all of my friends there 
 but none of them that I know of got killed in it 
 But they're all Christians though 
 God really protected them 
 See that broke out a revival in Mexico City That C B S news and A B C never told you about 
 There's been a real revival in Mexico City since that earthquake because there's a lot of you know there's a lot of sin in those nations and a lot lots of witchcraft a lot of witchcraft A whole lot of witchcraft So a lot of it in the name of Christianity
 yeah 
 There's a lot you know 
 they call themselves Christians 
 but you know they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff and just a whole lot of the generational things too like the Mayans and the Incas 
 You can't find a trace of them because God totally destroyed them for how wicked they were 
 And yet they are revered and honored and almost worshiped by 
 so many people 
 even now in America you know we wouldn't know the truth with all of Indian groups that were totally removed from the face of the earth because of how wicked they were 
 I've been down to the pyramids 
 and I have climbed to the top of the pyramid where they used to take a beating heart out of a young thirteen year old boy 
 and they hold it up to the sun God 
 and that's pretty of heavy duty
 I don't think so 
 The little box is black on the top of the pyramid in the sun 
 It's black 
 so 
 yeah 
 you can't really tell 
 but it was kind of weird {D you know 
 } you think wow there is where they did sacrifices to false Gods
 at that time I kind of did 
 It really impressed me just you know feeling 
 but I wasn't a Christian when I went there 
 but I think that a lot of those those you know generational things 
 I think that God sees I'm praying you know 
 that keeps the Christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray because that does affect that things you know in your background
