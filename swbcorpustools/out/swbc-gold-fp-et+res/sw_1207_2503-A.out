 Hi Wanet <> 
 How are you
 I'm from New England 
 Massachusetts
 Wow 
 This is quite a quite a long distance
 Do you have any pets
 How come you don't have any now 
 You get tired of them
 Yeah 
 I've got a little doggy that I've had quite quite a long time 
 In fact she just turned sixteen years old New Year's Eve
 And 
 I beg your pardon
 She's a poodle 
 a toy poodle a toy poodle 
 and she's 
 This is a little bigger than a teacup
 And it's funny how how I I a- acquired this animal 
 when I was married my ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy That she needed 
 the woman needed someone to baby-sit 
 and this is what she had told the kids 
 and she even told me that 
 And after the two week period was up she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it 
 Well after you had an animal for a couple of weeks it's you become you become attached to it
 So I've had this dog now for for sixteen years 
 and she's been a lot of company 
 she's however getting a little old 
 and things are starting to fail 
 I I live alone now 
 and she stays in the house all day while I go to work 
 and she's been holding herself pretty well The up until you know recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is 
 and I find a little present on the floor sometimes when I come home 
 But she's she's usually pretty good 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well you might want to get yourself an animal that doesn't require much attention Like a cat
 Yeah
 Well my my personal preference is is a dog 
 I don't know that that I would ever want a cat 
 I like cats 
 I just wouldn't want to own one 
 they're not they're they're affectionate 
 but they 
 yeah 
 I don't know 
 I can't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog
 Yeah 
 right 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 That 
 yes 
 we're supposed to appreciate them 
 Well my my dog when I came home when I come home in the evenings my dog greets me at the door 
 I don't know that a cat would do that 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I I think in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because she knows when I'm upset and I know when she's not feeling good too 
 So 
 I know like when she has an accident I know she's not doing it on purpose 
 When when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me
 and and you know some people might not believe that 
 but but but I do 
 Like if I if I put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours because I was going out She would break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to to to let me know that she was unhappy with what I did 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 yes 
 Animals have a way of talking 
 I I don't know that I'd that I'd trade my dog in for the world 
 it was about two years ago she got sick on me 
 and I took her to the to the vet's because she wasn't eating and and she wasn't able to jump 
 She you know lost all her activity 
 and she stayed there for one day 
 and the doctor called me up and said she had a low white cell count and that she wasn't she was dying and suggested that I take her to a working hos- dog hospital animal hospital 
 So I took his suggestion 
 and I took the the dog to a hospital The dog hospital there 
 and they said they'd keep her there for three days 
 Well she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care 
 It cost me over five hundred dollars
 Plus the the the vet sent me a bill for what he did 
 and then she recouped 
 She was okay for a couple of years 
 And then she got sick on me again 
 and I brought her to a different vet this time 
 and I told the vet what medication I had given her and everything 
 And he gave me the medication the same medication that I gave her the last time 
 and she was okay 
 and she's been okay every since 
 It's been about two years now
 Yeah 
 Well the see the problem is if if the if someone would have came up to me and said it's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive 
 What do you want to do 
 I probably would have had second thoughts
 But what they well what they do is is they say well it's going to cost you know twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this 
 and and you know and it creeps up on you 
 You don't know that you know 
 You really y- you don't know what it's going to until it's all over
 to give you an example My mom had an elderly cat who whoever evidently got a hold of it 
 and the cat got sick 
 So she took the cat to the vet 
 and she had the cat there for two days 
 and then the cat died 
 So the doctor had called her up and said your cat died 
 and you owe me this bill 
 and by the way do you want me to to bury the cat 
 So it cost her three hundred dollars 
 and she didn't get the cat back 
 So yeah 
 they had to pay for all the medical bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses
 And you know she just brought the cat in because he wasn't feeling good 
 So that that was kind of a surprise 
 At lea- 
 Yeah 
 Well even the you know 
 they they claimed they did the best that they could have have 
 and then the cat died 
 So 
 I'm I'm looking for another cat for them 
 I I've I've got a little kitten that's still just being born right now 
 So another five or six weeks I'll be bringing the little kitten over to to my folks
 Yeah 
 I I think it will 
 because they're both in their in their seventies And the cat although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes it turns it turns out to be a pleasant experience for them 
 I think they enjoy that
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well the same here
 Okay
 Bye now
 Okay 
 What is that sound
 okay 
 I'll let you go
 Right
