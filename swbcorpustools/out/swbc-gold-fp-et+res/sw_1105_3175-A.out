 Hi 
 basically I wear pants 
 I'm a real pants person 
 and like when I'm at home since 
 and I'll say I'm a homemaker since that's my basic thing 
 I wear a pantsuit most of the time 
 Not a pantsuit 
 I guess pants and a shirt 
 and in the summertime I wear cotton tops 
 Cotton top shirts 
 and in the winter I wear like sweaters 
 I like sweaters a lot 
 And so I do that 
 But when I go out for meetings then I will wear sh- either skirts or a dress 
 and I have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time 
 but that's basically what I do
 Oh
 Right
 Well that sounds nice
 it said the seasons 
 do do you change much through the season 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Maybe
 No
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Then may- <>
 well I don't have the resources to just go out and buy buy buy anyway 
 and so my don't change dramatically over the years 
 If I need something new I will go and buy it 
 But basically I'm a a pretty much the same 
 in the summertime I wear the light cotton 
 and in the wintertime I change to the sweaters
 And so it's not a whole lot of of change for me either 
 And especially when I go to the meetings and wear the dresses 
 I I I enjoy that 
 but it just wouldn't be smart for me to do that in my home with my children
 So I have to think about things like that too 
 I have given seminars before in in creative writing and things like that 
 Now I don't know if they consider that a job 
 I don't really get paid for that often 
 but when I do that then I I think I become more businesslike 
 but it doesn't really change my clothing style
 Yeah
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 dear
 That's not helpful
 Yeah 
 I guess so 
 Well it's been great talking to you
 Have a great day 
 Bye
