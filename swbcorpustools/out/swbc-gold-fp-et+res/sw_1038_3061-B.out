 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 gosh
 And how long have you had them
 Yes Kind of lose track 
 Well that's interesting because we have a simi- 
 we don't have cats 
 but we do have a dog who is an indoor dog
 and she is going to be thirteen this summer 
 so 
 Yes uh-huh
 she's a mix of Cockapoo Cock- Cocker Spaniel and Poodle
 Is that right
 Isn't that interesting 
 What color is your dog
 well ours is black 
 so 
 definitely different 
 Yes 
 she's a female 
 and she's been she's been a really a really good companion for me 
 she's like a little shadow you know kind of follows me around all the time
 and and she's slowing down considerably 
 She doesn't hear very well 
 and 
 she doesn't see very well 
 but she's 
 Yeah
 at this age I guess so
 But she's been a good dog to have 
 and I don't know 
 once she's gone I'm not sure if I'll get another animal or not 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 I agree 
 yes 
 did you get yours as a pet for your chil- 
 do you have children
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Well I was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before 
 or 
 My goodness
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Isn't that 
 Yes 
 So that often happens that way 
 Well we had intentionally planned to get a dog 
 We had just moved into this house and decided to wait about a year and then went then we went out then and found one 
 she was in the litter
 and she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy 
 they were all over the place
 and she was real docile and came over and just kind of sat next to us 
 and I thought that's the dog for me 
 Yeah 
 so she 
 and it 
 what was funny was that our daughter must have been 
 let's see 
 she must have been about eight at the time I guess
 and she just loved this little dog to pieces 
 but I think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her 
 I think she was always a little bit leery of her
 Our son on the other hand who was about eleven at the time was not very interested in pets 
 but as it turned out he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals
 So you just never know how that works out 
 Uh-huh 
 yes
 Yeah
 That's right
 That 
 yes 
 they're very unjudgmental 
 dear 
 Yes 
 I have been I have been reading and seeing about that on television
 Uh-huh 
 and how 
 Uh-huh
 Is that right
 Isn't that amazing
 Uh-huh 
 yes 
 It's funny how how pets can kind of take on a certain status in certain areas
 that made me think of when our daughter was looking at colleges we visited a campus in Saint Louis 
 and there were several dogs on the campus 
 and and the 
 what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly 
 but they didn't appear to belong to anyone 
 And I'm sure someone you know fed them 
 They were healthy looking dogs 
 But our guide that day said that the la- one woman many many years ago had given a huge sum of money to to the university on the condition that there be dogs just kind of left to roam aro- around the campus Which is the strangest thing I had ever heard 
 I know
 Yes 
 I know
 Yes 
 it really was 
 It was just a nice touch
 and it kind of made it seem more homey too 
 But th- 
 I thought that was most unique 
 And it just you know kind of goes along with what you were saying about the dog having sort of free run of the the nursing home
 So but I 
 this is the only pet we've had sin- you know 
 in all our years of marriage 
 and it's been sort of a a change for my husband because as a a a boy growing up his father had dogs 
 but they were always hunting dogs
 and so they were never allowed in the house you know
 they were always kind of 
 Yeah 
 right 
 That's what he said
 Yes
 So having a pet was a little bit different for him
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 yes
 my golly
 gosh 
 Isn't that interesting 
 I don't think I've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet
 Oh
 Oh
 Yeah
 I'll be darned 
 How interesting
 Uh-huh 
 I guess I've heard that uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Isn't that interesting 
 That's that's really something 
 how long did you have that
 Goodness sake
 my gosh 
 Isn't that funny
 Yes 
 and this is what it took finally 
 That is 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 My goodness
 Uh-huh
 I'll be
 My goodness
 That's in- That's interesting 
 I I wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Is that right
 Uh-huh
 Well 
 Yeah 
 so that that was right
 Uh-huh
