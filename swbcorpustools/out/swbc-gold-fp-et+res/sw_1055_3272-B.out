 Well the 
 I think I'm I'm skeptical about the whole thing and a still a little bit worried about them because of the his- the history of Russia
 And they're in a in a state of flux right now changing e- changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress
 And even in that situation the it seems like to me from what I've read in in the history of Russia and and you know different authors there has always been a paranoia 
 They've always suspected everybody 
 and and that's why they put you know that's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years 
 and that's why they put a lot of people to death
 Yes 
 but Stalin was a was a classical example I guess of that paranoia because he he probably killed more Russians than you know the Russian army killed anybody else
 Yeah
 Sure
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 you're a I think you're right
 There's a little more craziness down there 
 the Russian people I think are not that much different from us 
 You know I think they're that it would be the leadership that I I mistrust
 Yeah
 You too 
 Thank you
 Bye-bye
