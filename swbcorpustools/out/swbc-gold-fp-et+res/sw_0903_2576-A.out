 Here we go
 Well the changes that's occurred 
 like it how was it maybe ten twenty thirty years ago as opposed to what it is today
 how we're living socially in comparison to maybe from that time period from ten twenty or whatever you remember it to be
 Yeah 
 we are somewhat conservative 
 but as far as the socially our crime rate has increased 
 and although it's more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like violent crime is on the increase from what I've seen 
 and our prison population has significantly increased I would say 
 our economy too is really it's just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what I've read 
 and even the 
 well it started spiraling down I suppose in the seventies 
 and our recovery economically has not been like it used to be 
 To me also our nuclear family is not the same because more people are living together that aren't married
 I don't I don't know if 
 can't make any judgments of that nature 
 but I don't really want to either because I have no problems about it either way
 and kids are I I suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to
 women are more on the rise too so far as getting their careers established 
 and they don't no longer feel dependent upon men
 That's probably true 
 they they are a lot of them that have to put their kids into day care or having more with baby sitters 
 and especially if they don't have boy friends or husbands 
 and I guess that's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected
 in fact there was one lady in this area 
 she was caught going to work and leaving her daughter in her car all day
 Not a baby she was old enough to 
 I would say she was five to eight years old somewhere along that range 
 but that's just an extreme example
 I would imagine you know the situations are out there
 
 I agree there
 Yeah 
 I could agree with that because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age
 Uh-huh 
 that's an agreeable topic there 
 what else considering beside family economics 
 our transportation system has changed for us 
 we can we can now travel around the world in no time 
 It's just a hop skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast
 and well I I think what's happened too is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day
 and to keep abreast of the knowledge out there we got to constantly read go to school 
 T V watching has sure hasn't gone too much out the door because T V is still well 
 the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular T V programming and watch a lot of other a variety of programs out there as well as use of the V C R
 so that I don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education system
 Do you watch L A LAW
 I like that
 Uh-huh
 Well that's good 
 at least you're hitting the books right
 Uh-huh
 Well that's a change then 
 of course going to school too it's different from the home environment
 
 I agree with your parents because T V kind of ruined me 
 because that's that's all that we had
 well not really 
 but it's for the top medium of entertainment
 Even at your age
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I see
 Uh-huh 
 Is there anything else
 
 Work ethics 
 It's get- it's maybe getting better a little 
 of course we- we- we're having to weather through the savings and loans all the other scandalous items that well the greed that overwhelmed us in the eighties
 and I think I think it's going to have to have it's patchwork put on us because we have so much to pay for now 
 It's going to be really passed on to your generation and maybe a few others including what's left of ours 
 Well it was nice talking to you
 And what are majoring in
