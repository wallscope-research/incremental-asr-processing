 Oh 
 I 
 right now my car is terminally ill
 so I am really looking at facing the purchase of a car 
 And 
 what I would like to have is so totally impractical for me that I won't do it 
 But 
 well I would like for one time in my life to have a convertible
 And you know I don't even like the wind blowing in on me 
 so I don't know why I think I want one 
 but I do
 I will probably stay with a foreign make
 I've had real good luck with them
 Is that right
 
 well I didn't realize it 
 I knew that one of the that Nissan which is Toyota had joined with had a plant over here 
 And and I didn't know if it was General Motors or who 
 but I I never thought of 
 I know 
 you think it's a Chevrolet in the good old U S A
 Huh
 Well yeah 
 and that's minimum
 It you know it's it's a major purchase now 
 What we used to pay for homes is now what a car can cost
 If they held their value that would be one thing
 But when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot they're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated
 And you know that 
 I don't know that I'll go with 
 I've bought a new car the last three that I've bought 
 and I don't know that I'll buy a brand new one again
 Well I'm I'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car
 Well some people you know some people have to have a new car every year Or it you know at the most every two years 
 and they don't drive them that much 
 Especially your foreign cars You know like a Honda or a Toyota 
 Six thousand is just getting broken in for them
 And if I can find one or a repossession 
 And with the banks being in such financial you know problems now that people 
 you can find the banks willing to sell you a car
