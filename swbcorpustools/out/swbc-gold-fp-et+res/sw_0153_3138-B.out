 Alright 
 Sometimes not all the time 
 Right
 Yeah 
 that that's about the same boat I'm in too
 Yeah
 five
 well I'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys too 
 So 
 And they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have
 
 yeah 
 well see I m- my oldest is nine 
 and he already he already does that 
 And I told him he's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat 
 
 My husband and I our favorite meal is 
 and we do it 
 like for special stuff celebrations and we have like steak 
 and he does the steak 
 and then 
 Uh-huh
 And he marinates it in his special stuff that he does 
 And it's real good
 And I do sauteed mushrooms 
 so <> 
 and asparagus 
 And that's our favorite dinner
 Yeah 
 so do we <>
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 It's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it is it 
 I don't know what that 
 I don't see how you eat that 
 but 
 Oh
 Yeah
 So it 
 Yeah 
 it defeats the purpose
 yeah
 Yeah 
 My husband makes those
 I'm not I don't eat enchiladas
 I I don't like enchila- I don't like the tex- 
 I don't know 
 I guess it's the texture or something 
 I don't like the taste of enchiladas
 But everyone else in my family does
 Yeah
 I don't know 
 I it's I don't know what 
 I don't know 
 I I don't know what it is about the enchiladas 
 I just 
 and I'm the only one including my Mom and Dad and my brother 
 I'm the only one that doesn't eat it 
 But my kids love it
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I've got a chicken casserole that's like that that that I've 
 Yeah 
 because I when I make this chicken casserole I it it makes a real big casserole and then another one that I freeze
 So or I give it to my Mom and Dad if I know we're not going to eat 
 It's jus- 
 you can use chicken or turkey 
 because my Mom started making it like right after Thanksgiving and using the leftover turkey
 And it's rice and 
 when I do recipes I just throw stuff in 
 I don't I'm not real good about measuring
 because I just 
 I do it to taste
 And 
 Well yeah 
 but it it's like it's just chicken 
 it it's as much as you want you know torn up and and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery 
 and that's it and some hard-boiled eggs
 And that's it 
 You just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to you know heat it through
 And you sprinkle that those toasted onion rings On top of it for the crunchy 
 And that's it you know <>
 And it it it goes 
 and it's filling because of the rice
 So 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it gives it a an extra yeah little tang 
 Yeah 
 that cholesterol fat free 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 I know
 I don't like tuna salad unless it's got lots of mayonnaise in it 
 Yeah
 I know 
 Yeah 
 we did the low-cal stuff 
 Well with my kids I don't 
 they get enough sugar and stuff anyway 
 Mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway
 And they don't need any added help
 So when we're here at home you know with sweets and stuff they they don't we don't really do that much 
 I do a lot of fruits instead of the cakes and the candies and you know stuff like that 
 And and drink wise they have Kool-Aid milk or water Normally 
 Now when they go to their grandmother's house which is every weekend It's a it's a different <> a different story all around
