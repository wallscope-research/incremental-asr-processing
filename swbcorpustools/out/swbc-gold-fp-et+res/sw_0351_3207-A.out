 I don't 
 I am only twenty-eight 
 and I haven't had much experience with nursing homes 
 I don't I have never visited any of them 
 and I don't think I've ever even been in one 
 Have you
 Uh-huh
 And it it takes a lot of care 
 like twenty-four hours a day someone has to be Well there's someone in my my fiancee's family 
 His grandmother too and they're that hi- her son his uncle whatever you know anyway 
 He he has he's recently retired 
 and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke 
 and and all the other children are working or whatever
 They're all my parents age 
 And so he's got you know his retirement though is really twenty-four hours a day 
 They have a day care two days a week 
 They call it senior citizen day care 
 But she goes in the senior citizen center
 So sh- he gets a break two days a week 
 but it's only for like two or three hours at a time
 And you know just you see a lot of things like you you know was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired 
 and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now
 But he refuses to consider any other 
 I don't 
 Yeah 
 and is that how your parents feel 
 or 
 <> Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I know at this 
 I know I feel like I would never do that with my parents either you know 
 But I I really feel bad for the people I see th- not very 
 I'm not really really experienced 
 but like I said I just have that one family 
 and I just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now 
 and than he thought it would be 
 But 
 Yeah 
 and he's got you know seven brothers and sisters 
 and and he's the one because he's the one that isn't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone 
 And 
 well that's great
 That's a good idea 
 We ought to 
 Yeah 
 and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever I don't know what they're going to do 
 It's really not my family 
 It's my fiancee's 
 so I don't I can't say much
 But I always feel like I would never put my parents in either 
 and I wonder I'm going to be the only sibling that isn't going to have children 
 so if my parents do need to live with someone it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for You know 
 and I'm I 
 that's fine with me 
 I- my fiancee and I both figure that's what's we're going to end up with both of the parents or whoever 
 If the- 
 You know what I mean 
 We feel like it's our responsibility 
 and I feel like I would never put them in a home 
 But I wonder how much you know if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something
 You think about it 
 and it's really 
 I don't know 
 This country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country
 And It's really more of a like a respect issue th- that the older older people in other countries that I've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people 
 and and they really seem as wise 
 and and in this country nobody really Yeah nobody really pays attention 
 and they the old-timer made with the old way 
 and nobody respects the traditions 
 And you know it's I 
 I'm not saying that I do either 
 but you know it's just funny 
 and and we really don't have any that don't have the Social Security 
 and everything really isn't that much for elderly people to live on 
 You know even if they're in good health it's incredible
 They don't have any 
 they don't get special treatment and maybe they should you know because we're all going to get old someday
 And so it's a it's kind of a depressing topic though 
 How old are you
 So it is yeah and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother
