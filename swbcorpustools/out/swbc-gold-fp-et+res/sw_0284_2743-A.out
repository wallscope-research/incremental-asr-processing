 Okay 
 Hi Norma
 Have you taken anything back lately that you've bought
 Well why 
 Very good
 Good 
 Well wh- do you think that consumer goods goods are generally getting better or worse in quality
 I do too 
 I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time 
 but I don't 
 I I believe that they're better now 
 you know wh- 
 however I didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty-three thousand miles on it
 And I don't like it very well if when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out at on one side
 No 
 I had moved away
 I had taken the first one back 
 I didn't think that it heated well enough 
 It never did get anything but just moderately warm 
 took it back 
 and the people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be 
 and I fell for it 
 and when I got this one it did a lit- it heated a little bit warmer 
 and then after one year it started heating only on one side
 Also I took an iron back after having it only one year
 Now I figure th- anybody that is dumb enough to iron needs to have an iron that will last a long time 
 and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last
 Well without even any question 
 but I think it was the store
 Wal-Mart
 Yes 
 And well have you been buying any clothes lately Any new clothes
 That was poor quality I think
 I wondered if it weren't expensive
 and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever
 Yes
 You spent that much on your dresses
 You're really divulging very personal information
 of course I do too 
 Well I believe that we've been talking about five minutes
 And Norma it is just wonderful to talk to you
 You are a good one to talk about consumer goods because you keep up on it all the time
 Bye bye
