 So what do you guys having up there 
 I haven't been up there since Lord forty-eight I guess 
 Well no 
 it wasn't forty-eight 
 it was it was let's see yeah it was forty-eight 
 I was in the Air Force
 We did an air show out at out at Boone Greene out at Andrews 
 yeah 
 So what's it been like up there
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 like September was hot and dry 
 October 
 Really
 
 It really has been strange here this year 
 this whole ye- course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one
 But we had you know all these we have all these 
 somebody said you know you're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict Texas weather 
 but Well always they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever 
 and we had all this rain 
 and it really is not a bad summer at all really cool 
 But all of a sudden in in in October September October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time 
 And then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping just pouring down you know 
 There were flash floods everywhere that kind of deal 
 and then into of November the first like the second week you know the first week actually we had we had a freeze 
 and the average you know the average first frost is like the fifteenth of November here
 but usually it's not until later 
 It's really strange
 Yeah
 Is it is it is it flooding anywhere
 It's just kind of clou- 
 we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here which will be you know a little bit more typical autumn weather But really it's strange 
 We haven't really had an autumn 
 It's like we went into winter
 you know the poor trees said what 
 Yeah 
 it's 
 Yeah 
 there you you know 
 usually there's 
 I have a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas 
 and you know all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine you know 
 it's that same trees pines and and hard woods you know hickories and oaks and stuff 
 and I was up there last weekend 
 and there are trees that that still have their leaves on 
 and they're green 
 but they're dead 
 You know the the freeze just got them
 They they weren't ready for it at all apparently 
 and and we haven't had a typical fall at all 
 Not much color you know changes have occurred at all 
 Really weird this year 
 I'm not sure what that what that means
 So you you all actually had some color 
 It kind of crept in 
 and 
 Yeah 
 it's usually beautiful up there isn't it
 Gorgeous 
 That's you know 
 I think you could drive along in Maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the and the pines and what not 
 and you could you know you could be driving along in East Texas and looks just the same 
 It's almost you know identical kind of country
 Beautiful
 Yeah
 Oh
 Yeah 
 I was up I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend 
 so 
 Little little oak tree that was dead and cut it up and split it 
 Well 
 it there's some trees 
 like the oaks like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy 
 There's 
 nothing bothers them 
 Their leaves are still green 
 and some of the other oaks There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves 
 what I notice mostly is the red maples that the leaves are just dead the dogwoods still look still look you know they got bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit 
 but they still look pretty good
 It just depends on the on the on the tree
