 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 I see
 So what do you use for cookbooks
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well I I I think we come from from different backgrounds 
 so the 
 I I I 
 so it diff- you know 
 have different perspectives that you are 
 I find the JOY OF COOKING to be a remarkably useful book to to fall back on 
 because it has almost everything in it 
 But on the other hand it's not very inspiring 
 it's a good reference when you need to dig something up
 What we've found very useful is a book called THE THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK 
 I think that's the title by Marion Burroughs
 which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes you know the whole meal 
 and so she's 
 yeah 
 now now I I find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes
 But they're but they're but they're interesting they're interesting menus combinations that you wouldn't have nobody thought of
 
 gee 
 the one I had most recently was was one that was ha- 
 she she describes as Jim Beard's favorite summer menu or something 
 and it consisted of of grilled kielbasa sausage a potato salad with olive oil and some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there
 and that and that was you know that's that that's certain you can do in thirty minutes
 But there are a whole lot of you know 
 I I would recommend you look at that book if you're a busy person 
 THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 yes
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 Well you had said dinner you know you know 
 what would I put together for a formal dinner 
 We we had some friends over as recently as Saturday night
 and and put here here 
 the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert you know a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella which is this wonderful thing you can do 
 basically you're baking baking chicken in a in an open pan having marinated it first 
 and my wife did this part so I don't remember all the details
 marinated in olive oil and some seasoning and cooked with some olives and some and some prunes 
 there's a little bit of brown sugar in there 
 and it bakes up 
 and it's a delicious thing 
 and it's easy
 comparatively 
 So *[[slash error]] I'm sorry 
 I just love 
 Well maybe a little more leisure time to do it 
 I don't know
 Yeah
 I found my kids were very frustrating when they were little in terms of their tastes
 Well there again sometimes it was easy 
 they'd you know 
 canned ravioli was one of their favorites and so it was easy to open a can of ravioli
 Yes
 Well nice talking to you Cheryl
 Okay 
 Bye
