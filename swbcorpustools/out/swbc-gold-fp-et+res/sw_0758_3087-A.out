 Okay
 Right
 Why did I pick music
 because I know a little bit about music you know 
 so I thought that I would put that 
 plus I I like to listen to music
 I really enjoy the oldies 
 is what I really listen to most of the time 
 
 Usually in the fifties
 I'm not really sure 
 I think it's it's a fifties sixties and seventies station that I listen to
 really
 I don't know a lot of the musicians' names or the singers' names
 but I know a lot of the old songs
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I have
 I played the accordion for seven years
 and I played the clarinet for seven years also
 No 
 I played the accordion until I got into about sixth or seventh grade 
 and then in fourth grade I started the clarinet 
 and I played that all through high school
 I was 
 yes
 okay
 Uh-huh
 And then in concert band I played the bass clarinet
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 really
 I like the low notes better than the high notes 
 So 
 We didn't have any bass clarinet players 
 so I asked him if I could play it because I was first clarinet 
 and they end up playing a lot of the high notes 
 and I don't I don't care for the sound of the high notes 
 So I asked him if I could play the bass clarinet 
 and he said Sure you know 
 he didn't have anyone to play it 
 So I played it 
 and I really enjoyed it
 Uh-huh
 Pardon me
 No 
 I really don't go to very many concerts
 Uh-huh
 Yes
 wow
 I would love to be able to go see LES MISERABLES
 my gosh
 Holy smoke
 I would love to go see that and CATS CHORUS LINE
 I would love to be able to go see those
 They do 
 but I work 
 and I went to I go to college 
 I had just gotten 
 I just graduated from college in May 
 and so I really didn't have the chance or the money to go see them
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 My brother doesn't even like that kind of stuff 
 and he went to New York 
 a bunch of 
 there was like twenty students from high school that went 
 and he went to New York with them 
 and he saw it 
 and he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen
 and he doesn't even like that type of stuff
 really
 Oh
 see now I like that type of stuff 
 But my fiancee doesn't really like it 
 He's more into the New Wave music
 Yeah 
 I guess I don't know either you know
 I don't know 
 really weird names like The Dead Milkman 
 or su- I don't know
 it's you know really weird stuff he likes 
 and I thought my gosh 
 Yeah 
 Well 
 I pretty I'll listen to anything basically except I don't like the real hard metal rock
 I just refuse to listen to that at all 
 I'll even listen to country 
 I don't I like some country
 Uh-huh
 Do you like Randy Travis
 Uh-huh
 Hank Williams Junior
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 well those should be good albums
 If you have the chance 
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I don't know 
 maybe you wouldn't like Randy Travis 
 He's really country himself
 but I you know I I really enjoy listening to his music
 I don't know 
 If I were you I would get the Greatest Hits album if he had one because you know that would have a mixture of all his you know top songs on it
 But we have I think four records of his 
 I can't you know name the names of them off hand
 but we have I think all his records so far 
 and all my brothers and sisters listen to them even the ones that like the heavy metal they really enjoy listening to him 
 so 
 You know maybe if you did like Hank Williams and Garth you know maybe you would enjoy Tra- Randy Travis 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 do you know any 
 I was going to say do you know any other country singers that you would you know the women do you like the
