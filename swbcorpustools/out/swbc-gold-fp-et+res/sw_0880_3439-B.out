 let's see 
 I carry a lot of credit cards with me mostly because I don't ever have cash
 And I don- I 
 do you work for Texas Instruments
 Okay 
 Well at T I we have to use what's called a tex teller if we want to get cash out 
 and those are only available at T I
 So if I'm in a mall or something I can't get cash out without paying extra money 
 so I'm always using credit cards

 if you pay it that way it it really is it's like getting a free loan for a while Which is what I do
