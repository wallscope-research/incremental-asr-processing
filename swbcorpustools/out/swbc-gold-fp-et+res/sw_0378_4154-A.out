 Well what do you feel about the present situation in the Mideast
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I agree 
 I think I think there's definitely been some changes 
 and I think you know the the end of the Soviet Union will definitely have it's effect on on the situation
 you know in that there's there's not you kno- there you know i- you know 
 basically since the end of World War two there was always you know that little proxy war going on You know with the U S funding Israel and and the Soviet Union funding the Arab countries
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 but on the same token you know Israel has lost a lot of their you know value to the U S in being you know the foothold of capitalism You know in in the Mideast
 Uh-huh 
 <> Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 but on the other hand you know if they would have had a hard time retaliating because the you know they they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes
 They basically would have you know had a had a f- they had they would have had had to fly through you know two enemies
 The U S would claim that they would have not given them to them
 of course you know public statements can be taken for 
 <> Uh-huh
 D- 
 Uh-huh 
 You know well to begin with you know 
 I pretty much question or what what the U Ss motives were in in in actually the original involvement
 I 
 the cynical side of me says that you know it was more for the the domestic political situation than for anything else You know and that you know and for portraying Bush is a strong President
 I really I really think that that my gut feeling is that that you know he pretty much picked picked the fight with with Hussein
 I'm not not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to ge- enter that fight
 But you know I think I think that that we chose to have our official feelings hurt
 Where a lot w- 
 I think I thought I think that in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen
 And I I really don't I really don't think that 
 I think I think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests
 
 Yeah 
 And in in in along this line since since you know it it really it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting getting the Iraqis out of Kuwait
 I just don't I just don't I I I d- I I I don't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and you know in in fighting a second battle
 you know over over the over over what what probably won't accomplish him accomplish much for him politically
 Uh-huh
 <> Uh-huh
 Well I have I have very fixed feelings about Israel 
 I think that that for a long while we've we've had almost a you know ha- t-
