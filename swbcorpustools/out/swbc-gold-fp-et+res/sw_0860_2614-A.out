 Well thanks for being home on the weekend 
 I I'm actually working at night 
 and there very few people that are on the list for calls on the weekends nights
 Are are you part of the school system out there
 the reason I said that because I've had about three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of North Carolina 
 I guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever
 is that ri- 
 great 
 great
 is that right 
 That's wonderful
 yeah 
 I talked to one 
 we're not on the subject Of course 
 I talked to one 
 I think he had a whole bunch of calls 
 He had a roommate that had calls and everything
 He had way more twice as many calls as as I've made 
 and I I'm 
 of course we at T I just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will sell like gang books bu- busters really
 Okay 
 you first on the subject 
 wha- what do you think about Latin America
 Latin America 
 yeah
 really 
 T I had a place 
 I'm not too sure 
 I don't think they do anymore 
 down 
 I think it was Campinas 
 I'm not sure 
 and I guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever 
 And they had quite a few locations 
 not quite a few several in Latin America 
 I think the one in New Mexico is closed 
 and I think the one in in Brazil is closed 
 but I I don't know why that is a problem down there 
 and I guess the crime rate is terrible up here too 
 and an 
 some people say go to New York 
 but I don't I don't have an answer to the crime rate 
 It's sad 
 That is a sad situation 
 I I'd like to go down to Mexico you know 
 and I keep hearing that you know the government and and the crime rates pretty high too 
 that that is sad not that we can sell any great program we have with crime 
 but I think I'm kind of like you 
 I don't have any strong opinions on it 
 I guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our our neighbors down there is that we don't have any 
 We have more 
 I guess ties 
 we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything 
 and we don't really aren't that close to everyone in South America 
 I don't really know why though
 Right
 Right 
 Yeah 
 I know that I saw in a book 
 I was reading a Spanish book not that I read Spanish you know 
 I just you know reading some Spanish words 
 and there was a comment in there about the Mexicans don't really want us to say we're Americans 
 They would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too you know 
 and I guess that's true 
 We don't think of any one else but oursel- 
 I guess we're kind of the smart asses in the world I suppose or of America anyway 
 We think of ourselves as the only Americans when they're Americans too
 As Mexicans 
 yes 
 that that 
 No 
 no 
 I know 
 Yeah 
 no 
 they were saying that of us that we're the North Americans and they're Americans 
 they they 
 we always say we're Americans 
 and they they want us to say we're the North Americans
 We're not Americans 
 we're North Americans 
 and they're South Americans 
 yeah
 Whatever 
 I I don't want to make 
 I read it somewhere though 
 it's not my point I guess 
 so 
 No 
 no 
 they they were lucky enough to have some oil what ten years ago an 
 and they they blew all that and borrowed enou- more money than they can pay back now 
 and so they're not exactly business men 
 I do think we should deal more with them 
 I don't I do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas 
 for the language you know is very foolish 
 I'm relativ- relatively familiar with Texas school system 
 and we should teach Spanish at least in grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish 
 I think that helps when you certainly can speak their language 
 and there are problems with you know the wet back problem you know 
 for everyone knows what we're talking about 
 whe- say wet back problem 
 And then we should somehow 
 and I think the governments are working on that to try to have some businesses at the borders of both sides so that you can you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here an to to get the jobs you know 
 there there may be some organized way to do this
 I I do feel for them 
 they are very envious of us or they wouldn't be coming up here you know risking a lot 
 Not that they're risking their lives of course but risking a lot 
 getting thrown back I guess is all that happens
 You probably don't see that 
 Where 
 we see it you know once a month I'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that
 Okay 
 well you see it saw it out there then too
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I think a a common factor to a lot of problems both whether it be crime if if you want to jump on that is mostly poverty 
 and I think a lot of their problems is poverty 
 If we could 
 the problems we have yo- kno- in this country is is a lot of it's poverty 
 Whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty I that's another story 
 but it is sad 
 There there's so much down in all of South America so much potential you know 
 we're 
 T I of course is is really pushing world markets in their products 
 and they're they're mostly in in Europe now and in in in the Orient Japan and Singapore now just announced building a plant in Singapore 
 they're in Taiwan and Japan 
 and they're they haven't had what that much luck in South America 
 and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything
 And there's got to be trade 
 I guess that's some of the answer I guess is business 
 and I try to be an optimist and say well that that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to is to get some business going between each other 
 And we need we need to do more of that somehow And encourage more business between us
 They've got to have a lot of resources I would think An enormous amount of of well potential that way 
 A lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that 
 but there's got to be a lot of potential down there
 Wha- what are you taking in school
 I didn't ask you that 
 What are you taking in school
 yo- you're an instructor
 yeah 
 you're an instructor 
 yeah 
 you said
 That's great 
 Are you teaching Computer Science 
 Wha- 
 you said what were you saying you were teaching there
 Great 
 great 
 Right 
 I of course I work at T I 
 and I'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that isn't enough 
 I'm I'm I'm getting a kick out of the whole program 
 but there's going to be I guess thousands I don't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings 
 and I wonder how they're going to analyze them Whether it would be listening to them or analyzing 
 I gu- 
 they've got to be analyzing with a a voice recorder some how
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 yes 
 I know they change with age 
 I know mine changes has changed 
 although you you never found 
 your your voice echoes in your own head which is makes it different than what it really sounds to other people
 I'm sure singers and professional people know that 
 and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say my God that's that's not obviously that's not me you know
 But I know your voice in your own head resonates a different way 
 go ahead 
 yo- you comment on it 
 yeah 
 I'm glad that you're in the business 
 That 
 I kno- 
 T Is gotten with their Speak and Spell and everything 
 I've told my wife that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer
 you wouldn't have to have a keyboard
 you'll be able to just give it commands 
 and I'm sure they have some of that now 
 and not not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people
