 Yes 
 uh-huh
 Do you 
 Uh-huh 
 I I always enjoy watching the stal- the Dallas and Pittsburgh together You know
 Does he really
 Uh-huh
 wo- 
 I wonder if he'd ever do that
 Yes 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Well what about the Houston Oilers 
 Do you like them
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 And Warren Moon is is proving himself quite well right now
 Uh-huh
 He's one of the few Black quarterbacks that there are
 Uh-huh
 I don't know 
 I hope they they do better 
 They they 
 during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better
 But I think they still have a little I think they're still such a a young team I think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing
 Or if they even reach that potential again you know they may never reach that again
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 four in a row
 I don't know
 Shooting for one for the thumb now is what they were saying
 But basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now 
 so 
 I think Mike Webster was left 
 but then he he just left
 
 Yeah 
 I think he is 
 I think he was
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I didn't
 Huh-uh
 
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Well who would you say is your favorite player or has ever been your favorite player
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Really 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 ye- 
 you know that's really funny 
 well I I come from a large family 
 and the- there's quite a few boys 
 so that's kind of how I got in with the football 
 Either watch that or watch nothing
 And at one time I could name all the players on the Steelers you know
 And but even when Bradshaw was playing I I don't know I I didn't particularly care for him
 I thought he was kind of cocky or something
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 him and Franco Harris 
 I really didn't care for the either two of them
 they were good 
 but I you know you couldn't deny that
 But I didn't I thought you know well I just didn't really care for either one of them
 today my favorites out of those guys were probably Lambert Ham and Stallworth and Swan
 Uh-huh
 I I I like not just with the Pittsburgh I like watching on Saturday afternoons when they'll have like the plays the the best plays from you know from the week or something
 Yeah 
 I love watching that 
 Then I like watching their bloopers too you know 
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 it's funny that more people don't get hurt You know especially I would say the receivers when they're in the air and they get tackled
 yeah 
 it's funny some of their necks don't get broken
 Yeah 
 An they have to be in ideal physical shape basically
 Yeah 
 Well what did you think of a couple years ago for the Bears the Refrigerator
 you know and to me he does he's just so big and fat
 he doesn't even look like he's in shape 
 He's just so big no one can move him
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Wow
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 there's there are some really big guys playing in football
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 you would uh-huh
 now who 
 would you say that you have a fav- 
 other than Dallas would you say that you have a favorite quarterback 
 the quarterback's seem to get most of the the attention you know
 Yeah 
 I re- I I enjoy watching him play
 No 
 but he's still performing 
 Yes he is
 I I I enjoy watching him also
 What about Marino
 I think he'll get better as he gets older Because he he well wa- he was the youngest quarterback there was wasn't he
 Uh-huh
 That's true 
 that's true 
 <> probably around twelve uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 I didn't I don't know 
 I I just think you know Marino will get better 
 and his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the Super Bowl you know 
 so 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 ye- 
 and with age comes you know 
 the the 
 I'm sure arthritis sets in with them you know 
 Right 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 and they're so young
 but they're retired you know 
 and their so young still Oh
 yeah 
 but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that
 Yeah 
 a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple
 Holy smokes I didn't that doesn't seem like very long
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 what do you think of the L A Raiders 
 used to the the Oakland 
 Yeah 
 Yes 
 they have
