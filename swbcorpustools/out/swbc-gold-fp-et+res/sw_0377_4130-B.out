 I think we need we definitely need more of it definitely
 yeah 
 yeah 
 for certain
 Exactly
 Exactly 
 Does does like d- do health insurance policies like for companies and things do they cover diseases like that
 Uh-huh
 well that's but that's why they should have s- started doing stuff before 
 still you know since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people you know before the tests ever really came out who are who are draining a lot of money right now You know
 Right
 Right
 Right 
 and all these God-fearing people were like well you know God is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera 
 
 Yeah
 Boy 
 that's a good one
 Yes
 No 
 I really don't 
 I did I did like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff 
 and really we're not doing much at all 
 most of what gets raised it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by you know conscious yeah communities and things like that you know
 Like San Francisco has a a real strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff 
 and and get they get donations from the community you know they're real And from corporations around the around the city you know for AIDS research and that kind of thing 
 and I think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominated so far because it's you know it's bound to spread 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 I don't know 
 I don't know 
 I I I don't know what the likelihood of that is 
 but you know people really waking up
 Especially with the ultra conservatives move our our political system s- sort of seems to be taking
 Yeah 
 so 
 God 
 that's a good question Fish 
 I don't know 
 I think I think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education not support or or research per se but but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society you know kind of like lepers would you know
 and it's really it's really not necessary until until the disease reaches its final stage you know becomes really infectious
 and I think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand you know try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not you know they don't they don't have to be just completely cut off from from the community
 and that and I don't know 
 I guess I think that that research is I guess the most important just because I you know it it really needs to come to an end You know 
 I don't know 
 I don't know Fish 
 What do you think about that subject
