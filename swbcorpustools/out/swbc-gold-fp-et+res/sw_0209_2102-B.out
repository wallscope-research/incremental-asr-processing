 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Uh-huh 
 I think I've actually seen a number of STAR TREKS one way or another over the years although I never watched it regularly 
 I'm certainly acquainted with the character the characters 
 And then I've seen some of the STAR TREK movies
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I don't think I I've even heard of that show
 It's called MCGYVER
 And what is what is he
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 great 
 Boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard and see if he could build a Seven Forty-Seven out of it
 Well I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES as a matter of fact 
 and and I used to like the show very much
 But unfortunately I find getting rid of your T V set you do throw out some some of the baby with the bath water
 And I just decided I had to do that I think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it 
 I could just sit mindlessly in front of a T V set for hours
 And I just realized I was sort of like an alcoholic 
 if I didn't get the booze out of the house I was going to drink
 So 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah <>
 Right 
 well when my kids were little I did have a T V set 
 and I did watch a lot of SESAME STREET and a lot of ELECTRIC COMPANY as well
 Well that would be a shame
 Huh
 Yeah 
 How about MISTER ROGERS 
 is he still around
 I see 
 I see
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I figure your children are preschool
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon
 Uh-huh 
 okay
 Okay
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 little with little kids the T V set really is a 
 I used it as a pacifier
 I'm not sure it was that great for my children 
 but they turned out okay 
 so 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well I'm trying to think if I ever even had a favorite one at one time 
 I do seem to reme- 
 is that the one where they he always got this this tape recording that self-destructed
 MISSION 
 that's right 
 MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 
 Yeah 
 I used to watch that 
 In fact I can still remember a couple of those 
 They were 
 I thought those were very good
 Yeah
 
 Right 
 Right 
 You 
 Yeah 
 I do remember that 
 And I remember as a kid my parents watching the ED SULLIVAN Show 
 That was really the big deal in our household was the ED SULLIVAN SHOW 
 Yeah 
 I gu- I guess it was a Saturday night 
 and I went to see the movie THE DOORS a couple of days ago 
 and they had this scene that por- portraying THE DOORS appearance on the ED SULLIVAN SHOW
 They even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan 
 and it was very very funny
 I think it was the funniest part of the of that movie
 Well I don't know 
 was there any 
 I remember the MILTON BERLE SHOW even 
 I was I was 
 well I guess I have to admit that I am 
 I see
 Yeah
 
 Yeah 
 That's that's interesting 
 I think it's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from TV 
 people were just as violent before T V was invented maybe even more so
 But I guess that's that's a different topic 
 isn't it 
 Yeah 
 Well it was nice talking to you 
 Tell me tell me where you're calling from
 Garland Texas
 All right 
 I'm in Nor- 
 I'm in Raleigh North Carolina
 Yeah 
 I think they're doing it trying to do it or I hope they're trying to do it all over the country because they need to collect all kinds of different different dialects
 Same here
 Bye-bye
