 Uh-huh 
 What type of camping did you do
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 uh-huh
 how neat
 Uh-huh 
 Well I know I have I just have a tent 
 and the kids and I like to go out and camp in the tent
 And then I bought a van 
 and that way I can sleep in the van and be more comfortable 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I don't I don't think I'm a real true trooper you know when it comes to camping
 All the bugs and stuff 
 But I I try 
 But but I try you know to to get out there and enjoy everything 
 But what was so fun though is that I had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends 
 and he got poison ivy
 and it's all over him 
 The poor thing you know 
 so there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at 
 shoot
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Right 
 Right
 Definitely when it's cool
 Well have you done much camping around Texas
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Well have you camped all over the United States
 Wow
 See now I haven't so that 
 I bet you that's an experience there
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Well I know my parents like to camp a lot 
 and they they've been going to Gulf Shores Alabama And which is really really neat 
 They said they've got the white beaches and the sand
 and it's not real populated so they can they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean
 And from what I understand from them it's really really pretty there
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well have you done much camping up in Kentucky and and those parts in the mountains
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 right
 Yeah 
 yeah
 yeah 
 yeah 
 rent a beach house or something *[[slash error]] yeah that's that's my idea of camping
 *[[looks like the 'yeah' should be an independent slash unit ]] But we're we're getting more into it 
 and we've done we've done quite a bit 
 and the kids like to go out you know as often as they can/
 so that's good 
 You know they're they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping
 Right
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 well that's really neat
 Well 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's neat
 That's really neat
 Well I well I have a son that's going to be eleven here pretty soon and then a daughter that's thirteen 
 So they're they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and cooking and and all that kind of stuff too
 So that's that's really neat
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 I I agree with you 
 They like to get out there 
 and but this wasn't so fun this last time for Nathan to to get out there 
 and he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy 
 and it got all into his eye 
 and it was really swollen 
 and so they had to give him shots and everything 
 so 
 well maybe next time he'll stay away from those particular trees or what bushes whatever they are 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 No 
 now I like to go out like several times a year
 But not on a on the regular basis 
 I have some friends who go out every single weekend when you know in the season
 and and I just couldn't do that you know
 Yeah
 yeah
 Just getting away
 Yeah 
 right 
 right 
 see I see they just want to get away
 But every Friday night they'll go home you know straight from work 
 and they'll pack up 
 and you know and then they'll leave 
 and I'm just going you know 
 by Friday night I just want to crash you know 
 and I want to go home and you know do all that and then get out on the road to boot 
 so 
 But anyway that's their life 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that's true
 Uh-huh
 Now that's true 
 That's true
 Yeah 
 
 That's true
 Well it was nice talking with you
 Okay
 Okay 
 well take care
 Bye-bye
