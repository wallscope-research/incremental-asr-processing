 Well what d- do you think in terms of benefits
 Absolutely
 Well I have to agree with that 
 You know I was thinking about importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while I was waiting for the system to find a a respondent
 And I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed 
 and I suspect that that's probably true for everyone
 When I was much younger it was less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits 
 But as I grow older and my family grows it the medical benefits are more important 
 and the retirement is more important
 I think they have a- one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves
 And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the CODA Plan
 It's certainly a a supplemental way 
 and I suppose if b- maybe in in your instance if if you're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five then you'll have a very good retirement plan
 But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later
 So it's not 
 all by itself it won't be adequate for for my situation
 So I have to find a way to supplement that
 I unders- understand though 
 it 
 believe me I do that myself
 And I disagree with you 
 I don't think it's the worst investment in the world
 Well it's in terms of guaranteed return on investment 
 and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed until later
 it's shown a history that sure beats anything else Over many many years
 I understand that approach 
 That's what that's exactly what's happening in my family
 Un- except that mine are a little bit older 
 and and I've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available 
 all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there
 You better make sure that you've got a scholarship
 *[[slash error]] I know 
 *[[slash error should be 'aa']] And boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them 
 I have a an eleven year old daughter now who's saying gee Dad I want to be an allergist
 and I said that's wonderful 
 I applaud that 
 Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that
 And then her little brother's only two years behind 
 and he says well I don't know 
 I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian 
 And I said that's great 
 Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that
 Well that's fantastic
 and on whole o- I would say that they're equal to most of our competitors
 I can see some some potential changes that probably are are would not cost very much but might make things a little easier Such as offering a a smorgasbord Having a larger variety of benefits 
 but but here's the amount that that T I is going to pay for it
 now it's up to you 
 it's menu selection so to speak
 Well I could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a a standardized compensatory time for overtime
 And I don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that
 and and I would certainly support something like four to one or five to one 
 or or you know maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one a- as a repayment for every three to five days that I work overtime there they should give me one day
 But it should be a standard and and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate t- that's running in each department
 Well that's for sure
 I'm sure personalities always come into play
 just in this size of organization
