 Jeez
 Yeah 
 I'm I'm I have some great concerns about my parents and my relatives reaching that age 
 around here where I live in Maryland in the Washington area there's there's 
 and I used to live down in Dallas there was just so many stories about rest homes where the people are being abused where the people are being kept in filthy conditions 
 In fact here in Baltimore they've actually shut a couple of them down and taken all the people out of them because they were so bug infested and rat infested
 And I 
 it really concerns me that first of all that anyone could let someone live like that 
 but if you have to you know how do you make sure 
 I'm sure when you make your appointment and go by everybody puts on a happy face 
 you know how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is because once you put someone into there you know they may not like the fact that they've been put in there 
 and they might complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there 
 and you know 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 that's true 
 My my grandmother's 
 last time my mother went down there to visit the the place where my grandmother was staying at was so overrun with roaches that she even ha- you know they went in and she had roaches crawling on her 
 There were roaches even in her alarm clock 
 Yes 
 it was absolutely horrible 
 They took her immediately out of there 
 and they just threw everything away that that she had from there 
 they wouldn't even take the the the dresser that she had that was her own dresser because it was just you know full of bugs
 They just left everything And bought her all brand new stuff 
 and they they had called a home where they you know where they were on a waiting list to get into there and explained to the person that was in charge you know what had happened and that they had ta- they had to take her out of the home because of the conditions 
 And amazingly enough the very next day they had an opening 
 and they put her into that opening
 I'm not sure what exactly is wrong with her 
 Up until nineteen eighty-two 
 actually I'm sorry not until 
 yeah 
 I guess it was around eighty-two eighty-three I found out I had a grandmother
 Prior to that I was told that she was dead 
 and apparently what had happened was that I had a grandfather who put her into a mental institution
 And you know it was a real hush-hush thing
 and then I was wondering why my mother always referred to you know his second wife as that hussy
 Yeah
 Yes
 I know
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 my mother has made similar statements that she doesn't want to become a burden to the family 
 You know Just put me out to pasture or shoot me or something you know 
 are the lines that come from her 
 And and I tell her you know No problem Mom always got a place for you 
 But Uh-huh
