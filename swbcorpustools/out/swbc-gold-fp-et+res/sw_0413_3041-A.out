 So what movies have you seen lately
 Oh
 Well see that's something I want to see
 that's on my list to see
 okay
 did you
 Oh 
 See that's also on my list
 A disturbing movie 
 how do you mean
 Right
 A switcheroo 
 Right
 When the shoe is on the other foot and see how it 
 Oh
 Because that that just reminds me of you know like back in school 
 and you know the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something Just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble 
 but 
 yeah
 Before we found the shopping malls that's what we did
 Yeah 
 well I'll have to put that I'll have to keep that on my list then
 Oh
 Scandalous
 I can imagine
 I guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is 
 
 You just had to find it 
 You had to wade through it and find it 
 You never quite got to
 All I know about that woman is that she's an in- incredible marketeer 
 Yeah 
 and she's rich 
 and she 
 yeah 
 so 
 She knows how to twist this around 
 Well okay 
 see we're getting back to last year 
 That's probably the last movie I saw DANCES WITH WOLVES 
 I just adored it
 How can I tell you 
 a couple years ago I guess well maybe ten years ago I I had read BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE 
 and so you know just the general theme of the whole movie was pretty 
 I really liked it a lot
 I mean it was a real consciousness raiser I guess 
 and I only bring up WOUNDED KNEE because that was what ten years ago you read and and understood you know about the American pop Indian population 
 and then everything went away for a couple years
 and now it's back again 
 And you know it's sort of a popular view of what happened way back then
 Of course no one will ever know 
 Really I don't kn- 
 Well who knows 
 it it it sort of showed like two different types of tribes 
 like one was a warring tribe 
 and the other one was vegetarian kind of you know feel good tribe You know sort of thing 
 so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world
 Nobody can get along peacefully 
 I see
 Yeah
 
 Well I think so 
 I I have come to respect a little bit more the you know what went on here
 but but who knows how it's supposed to all end 
 You know on the on the broad scope like if it it it had a much bigger thing I thin- 
 meaning to me 
 I think about you know just the meaning of the freedom of this country and and what that really meant
 And that was taking over somebody else's freedoms And sort of trampling that 
 and so you know it it meant something bigger I think 
 But still it was a fantas- 
 I loved the buffalo scene 
 And I thought Kevin Costner was just 
 I got a little sick of his mug on the screen every three minutes 
 but he's the director you know 
 but yeah 
 I I just thought it was a really interesting intense film
 Intense I think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast
 Yeah
 Ate a lot of popcorn
 Did it really
 
 It made you think
 Maybe i- well maybe that was 
 but there are no answers you know
 That that can make you crabby yes
 Really 
 that's true
 But it it's 
 they sort of candy coated the western story for many years
 and you know when the truth well 
 it always balances out one way or the other once you get the whole story 
 but 
 Have you seen any other movies Because you sound like you see a lot
 okay
 there you go 
 Oh
 Oh
 Really
 Oh
 I'll have to write that down
 Wow
 <> I'll have to write that 
 have you have did you see TEXASVILLE 
 Are you into Larry McMurtry
 Yeah
 I I read a lot of Larry McMurtry books
 and TEXASVILLE is just like that 
 It's like very peculiar circumstances and very peculiar things that people do with each other 
 it's it's you know 
 and it's just sort of a
