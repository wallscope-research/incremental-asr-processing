 Okay 
 do you want to go ahead 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Right 
 I do too 
 I like the idea 
 I see a lot more 
 my children I have five children 
 and they're all married
 And I love seeing the men help the women so much 
 And they both cooperate together on 
 I think it's great
 Right
 That's right 
 That's right
 I've always taught my men that 
 They better clean up with their women and help them 
 If they did that you know 
 And they're they're good about it 
 But it is neat to see them all work together 
 And a big thing that I see All that most of the most of the women getting married now go back have gone back to you know 
 they they stay at work or go back to work Or whatever 
 And they're well educated
 And I believe we'll see a lot more C E Os in companies 
 They're having a fit about how little there are
 And I think we'll see a lot more Don't you Of upper management Then we do now even
 I think it'll escalate
 And and I think black women now 
 i- in fact I work at a high school
 And my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted 
 and she's very sharp 
 And I think that th- 
 and the ethnic thing will be you know is a good thing now
 They're moving them up 
 and they're sharp 
 and they 
 so you're going to see a lot a lot more of that in leadership I believe
 Uh-huh Right
 Right 
 That's a shame 
 Yes
 Yeah 
 But they wouldn't know what they're doing
 But I'm not big on subserving as far as to the men at all
 But I never have gone along with that you know Even far back 
 But I was brought up pretty good in a home that 
 years ago my mother was that way 
 The same 
 I 
 my bo- 
 ther- you know 
 some people say the boys shouldn't have to do those jobs The inside jobs 
 But we never were taught 
 they had to do as much as we did 
 So that was good 
 So that's I think that's good To keep the equal as far as as not nex- nex- necessarily by sex type thing You know 
 You should be able to accomplish as much 
 And I think the attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now
 You see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls you know you can do it 
 If he can do it you can do it type thing
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 What about politics on it
 Do you think the political scene 
 Yeah
 I'm real dis- I'm kind of disgusted this year because I don't see many women into the political scene 
 and I really think we should have more political leaders in the women than we do up for and even for President and Vice President this year 
 there's nobody again 
 I think they're all scared out after tha- after 
 what was the lady's name that ran a couple of 
 Fitz- 
 I forget her name now
 But you know who I mean
 Yeah 
 She took such a rough go of it 
 And they t- their tax deal and 
 Right 
 Right
 But I wish they would get some more on that 
 I really was disappointed this year when I see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about 
 they I didn't see any of the women in there
 And that disappoints me
 And right now I don't think we have too many th- in the forefront 
 Schroeder's about the biggest one in Washington
 Congress woman 
 And other th- 
 we really
