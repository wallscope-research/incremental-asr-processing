 Are you in the market for a car recently
 what did you get
 Uh-huh 
 what what convinced you to get that one
 Uh-huh
 incredible 
 how many miles on it
 And it's still running real well
 great 
 yeah 
 We have right now we have two cars 
 I have my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers and one of which is a an eighty-eight Plymouth Voyager Van 
 and then we have 
 about a year ago we picked up a second hand Audi
 and that was a ca- you know a sedan 
 and we got that 
 The major things 
 the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova 
 and a 
 well 
 my son was driving 
 and someone came into his lane and hit him 
 and fortunately he was able to 
 his 
 he was checked out of the hospital was out of the hospital by that night but the car was completely totalled
 and Mike and they had been my two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that which was hit by another car
 So I got I was getting really nervous 
 so I finally said we I want a really solid car 
 So we found the Audi second hand 
 I guess right now my criteria for cars is of being solid able to take an impact 
 and so I we're not going to be in the market for in the near future for any new car
 But the things that I would want <> would be a solid car 
 Another thing I'd definitely <> want would be anti-lock brakes
 our our van which is a a delight to drive does not have 
 I think the brakes on the Plymouth van is just are terrible 
 If the road is at all wet and I'm 
 and I don't go all that fast but the it it just doesn't hold 
 It doesn't hold well at all 
 So I I definitely want to get anti lock brakes 
 So I don't know 
 do you have any particular things that that are priorities on your list
 Yeah
 I guess down here air conditioning's a must isn't it
 Uh-huh
 That's incredible
 That is incredible
 [ we we get about + our the van gets on highways can get about twenty-eight 
 The Audi does not have good mileage 
 That's the one drawback 
 It's a powerful car but it does not 
 I if I'm on a highway and I can get twenty twenty-one miles per gallon I consider that luck- I'm lucky 
 Maybe maybe sometimes I've gotten twenty-two 
 It comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving
 and that's a to me is a real drawback 
 I wish I would you know I could settle for twenty-eight 
 but the the frills on that car are nice but they're not necessary for me except air conditioning 
 In this area in Washington D C area it gets hot and humid
 Yeah 
 so air conditioning is def- definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer 
 but I I I don't need you know 
 power windows are nice but I don't need them Although I must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads come into a toll road you just push that button down 
 it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up instead of having to crank it
 Yeah 
 but or you know if you want to have open windows to be able to op- 
 if you're alone in the car just to press buttons and 
 But you know I've lived all these years without them 
 I probably could have lived a little longer 
 one of the things that we have we've liked when we gotten a new car and this this used car has it is a sun roof
 and those are really nice in good weather
 So so I guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have an- anti lock brakes 
 I'd love to get an air bag and a sun roof and just so it'd be a good solid car 
 I guess that those are m- my major criteria 
 Everything else is you know a luxury 
 and they make the car more expensive but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong
 So if you were to buy a new car now a brand new car what would you look for
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Isn't that true 
 It's it's funny that you use 
 the Audi's German and I have to say it has been pretty dependable
 Yeah 
 sometimes one advantage of an American made car is if you get stuck anywhere most local garages can fix you up
 But once you get if you once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really 
 and the parts I know the Audi parts are terribly expensive
 it jus- 
 I shudder 
 I would not get the Audi again just for that reason 
 But I would love I wish an American an American that you know engineering would make something as solid as a German car 
 You know we certainly have the technology 
 but it's amazing 
 when we bought this Audi 
 everything is more solid in it
 if 
 you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic
 and I know 
 and I I and I'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a solid car 
 I don't think I have to give up as much as I'm giving up
 But do you need air conditioning down there
 Yeah
 we've had eleven days in a row over ninety
 They've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that
 Well listen 
 I enjoyed talking with you
 Okay 
 and enjoy enjoy your car
 Thank you 
 you too 
 it's going to be a hot one
 Okay 
 bye-bye
