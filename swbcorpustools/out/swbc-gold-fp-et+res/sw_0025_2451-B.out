 Well they do have a major internal problem 
 Everybody wants to defect 
 and I can understand why 
 I think their biggest problem is just you know obtaining food to live 
 so when you have the basic needs being unmet I don't think you think globally as far as you know being a threat to other people in the world
 So as soon as they get their their own home country taken care of then they'll consider what they can do with the rest of the world
 Well I do I do realize that the Bush Administration isn't too happy with with how they're handling their internal strife you know as far as diplomacy is concerned 
 I think it's been a good a good positive direction for the Soviets as far as Yeltsin is concerned 
 You know he was allowed to 
 what wh- 
 in his in the Congress they they gave him more power as far as his republic in Russia is concerned which is gives him more power overall which I think is a good sign that there will be some you know 
 politically speaking you know he's going to have more power 
 and I think it's a step in the right direction 
 I think Gorbachev realizes that he's got a a major power figure you know competing against him 
 and I think it's going to be pretty close to his demise if he doesn't follow suit with Yeltsin as far as realizing 
 well he does realize it you know with the fact that they reduced the they increased the prices on their food food and goods
 It 
 yeah 
 Tha- that's incredible 
 but they had to go in the direction of a market driven economy 
 and and they had to bite the bullet for that 
 So that's a good move on on Gorbachev's part in doing that
 So 
 Well that's all they got right now 
 That's their ray of hope
 So you know they'll go with you know whoever comes through for them 
 I it it's just that the weird thing is is that Gorbachev is the one that opened the floodgates as far as with glasnost and poistro- perestroika and stuff 
 and I think he's got between the Old Guard and <> and the new glasnost 
 I think it's kind of escalated to a point where it's out of control
 And I think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how in order to keep the peace on peace on both sides 
 So I think that's where you know kind of where he's stuck 
 You know what I'm saying
 And that's the that's the situation that he finds himself in 
 and you know he's a tough guy 
 he's been through it 
 So I have no doubt that he'll 
 I I think overall he's been a a good figure for the Soviet Union 
 I think his intentions and his ideals are are well intentioned
 And in the long-term 
 but I just think that because of the basic needs that the people don't have 
 I think that makes the problem most severe and makes him look look worse that what his what his ideals are personally
 I think it's I think it's a lot of oh how do you put it bureaucracy and and one thing and then all the corruption 
 I think there's a a large amount of corruption on the the have and the have-nots You know 
 I I know you're going to have that with every society 
 At least we're more blatant about it 
 but it's very secret 
 and it's been going on for years 
 you can't change things overnight
 And but if it gets to a point where people can't survive there's revolution You know 
 and that's 
 Yeah 
 big time 
 major 
 but you know that's that's what happens when you know the cork blows 
 and you can't handle it anymore 
 that's that's the way the world you know revolves that way 
 Anyway I really question though how much technology the average Soviet is exposed to
 Yeah 
 I think they're starting to realize 
 but I I just don't think they have the resources if you were to compare the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fact machines Fax machines and cellular phones and state of the art equipment that we are so used to 
 I don't think they even realize what's out there and to what extent
 Yeah 
 the major conveniences of life 
 Yeah 
 This is true 
 This is very true 
 And we 
 it's human it's human nature though to take things for granted 
 and it kind of you know 
 when you've lost something or or don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize you know what's out there and what you know what you have and what you don't have
 So the original question do we think their a threat to our you know a security threat 
 yes and no
 no
 Well I don't really feel that the Soviets really want to blow up the world 
 we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as as nonfeeling machine type people 
 and they're people just like us 
 you know they get up everyday 
 and they put their pants on the same way 
 and they have to eat and everything else 
 and I just don't feel that <>
