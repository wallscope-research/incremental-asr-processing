 I guess it's 
 watching the ra- the T V today there had a lot of stuff on on crime 
 In our state right now recently they've had a lot of the rapists murder type killers going around 
 and well I I 
 they've caught them 
 and they they're in there
 Well yeah 
 Wisconsin and Milwaukee area you know
 Yeah 
 So that's 
 well I I live right on the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin 
 so I kind of get both both news 
 and I know in Minnesota they had the one that just got out and went after a college student and raped and killed her 
 and they are not too happy about that now <> I guess 
 so 
 There 
 Yeah 
 that's hard to say for sure 
 I sometimes I wonder if these people aren't don't it just for the publicity 
 and They they get their names in the in the paper

 And that's 
 and there are a lot of repeaters 
 Yeah
 Yeah

 and they and when they get back out they just go into worse crimes
 Maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well I don't know with with my limited psychology background I do have I don't I don't even feel that prisons and stuff are are the answer 
 If you want to stop the crime I think you've got to get the people when they are kids
 A lot of this probably just starts with from the from the homes Also from the the the media the T Vs the 
 all these gory movies on there becomes just a natural fact of life
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well a lot of the European countries they tend to sensor 
 well they probably won't sensor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent
 And they have a lot less crime
 Some of some of those European countries are are you can leave your your doors open and and and be safe 
 even I think New Zealand is one of one of the places that
