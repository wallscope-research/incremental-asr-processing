 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Well I am a working mother 
 I have three children 
 and my children since I since they were very young 
 I've had various different alternatives child care arrangements 
 and like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it 
 I personally feel in our particular situation I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home 
 and my kids I think are very very secure well raised children 
 My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities 
 So I I I e- 
 you know it is a problem 
 And but as you pointed out I I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities 
 and that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford 
 When our children were very young we had a pay a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful 
 And then as they got older they went to I preferred to call them schools 
 and they were really all day preschools 
 and they were wonderful 
 And I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things
 But we did we really truly did pay a fortune 
 we were paying at one point well about about a close about five hundred dollars a week for two children
 So 
 Well I mus- 
 I'm a physician and as is my husband 
 And and I felt very good about working 
 I'm a pediatrician actually
 So but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children 
 but and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for I think 
 Well 
 I think it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in 
 And we had a really wonderful arrangement 
 I'm with the university actually
 and they had a wonderful program that started at age three 
 and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work 
 And so many times at lunchtime I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing 
 And they had wonderful 
 they had things like gardens and lots of pets 
 and just they had a four to one teacher student ratio 
 So that that sort of an 
 most of the teachers had degrees 
 Yeah 
 It was incredible actually 
 But it was good 
 it was it 
 at that time there were two children 
 and they were in special programs 
 and each one was a little over two hundred a week 
 and then in addition I paid a little bit extra 
 But the kids were 
 they really had some great opportunities 
 But tha- 
 what you were alluding to earlier is you know women who work for minimal wage an- and and really have t- feel they have to put their children 
 sometimes they do put them in fairly low paying sit- situations 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 No 
 even that that really I think I don't 
 it's been awhile since I've looked at 
 my youngest child is eight 
 So it's been a little while since I've looked into actually daycare centers 
 But they are 
 you know the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since 
 Uh-huh
 Something like that
 Well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children 
 it has been a real 
 th- there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences 
 And I think I think they have captured a certain market 
 Again the 
 but then there are baby-sitting groups 
 As a pediatrician one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections
 As you start putting lots of little kids together the infection rates that go around
