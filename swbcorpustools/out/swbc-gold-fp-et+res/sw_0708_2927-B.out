 boy this is going to be tough I'm in Plano 
 Exactly 
 I guess the weather hasn't been too different between us
 W- 
 what part of Dallas are you from
 north Dallas
 Well jeez
 Well then you've been getting quite a bit of rain also
 How about that 
 How does it compare to the years past
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Huh 
 Well what brought you guys down to Texas then
 How about that 
 That's great
 Right 
 Well definitely I'm sure the winters are more mild here
 Uh-huh
 Sure
 It seems that progressive 
 I've been down here five years just over five years now that every spring and summer seems to get more and more rainy
 Huh
 A hundred and sixty
 Uh-huh 
 right 
 Sure
 Right
 Uh-huh
 True
 Colorado
 sure I I'm I'm very familiar 
 my grandparents and all my relatives are from Wisconsin
 So I'm quite familiar with how it is up there 
 and if you 
 kind of interesting the people down here typically don't think it gets above you know fifty degrees 
 And it's always snow you know 
 but 
 yes
 Uh-huh
 sure 
 My parents just live thirty miles south of Denver 
 and it can be sunny and and no problem in Denver 
 and they'll be having snow 
 So it's pretty amazing it can be that drastic in just a short distance 
 it's getting to be more and more of a possibility
 It used to be no problem just because it was such a a rugged terrain and with trees everywhere 
 but now as they start to clear more things out
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yeah 
 me neither
 But 
 Sure 
 sure 
 Well it's been good talking to you
 Good-bye 
 Good-bye
