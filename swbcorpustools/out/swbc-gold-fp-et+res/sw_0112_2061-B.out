 All right 
 Well I guess we're supposed to talk 
 what about 
 credit card 
 one of my instructors said that they were doing something like this 
 and 
 A a Masters in information systems
 Yeah 
 Where at
 Hey 
 How do you like it out there 
 Yeah 
 Oh 
 Raleigh Durham 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 So it it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway 
 Kind of quaint little towns 
 but they don't have a whole lot there
 well I'm in Monterey California right now 
 Yeah
 Two hundred fifty
 Okay 
 It it's it's a lot bigger than Monterey is 
 But we're just just south of San Jose and San Francisco
 And it's only a couple of hours away a hour away to a you know to a large city
 No 
 no 
 I go to the it's the naval postgraduate school out here
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Well that's what they look for 
 Whether or not they get it is hard to say <>
 *[[ spelling: "dragged" not "drug" in this case ]] Yeah 
 Yeah 
 It's pretty tough 
 It's pretty tough 
 I 
 let's face it you know 
 And you know I you know did the you know 
 as far as 
 I found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know 
 It's what you do You know 
 So I don't lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that
 Probably not 
 See I'm in the Navy
 And you know most of the Navy funds that I probably won't do it until I 
 if I do do it it will be after I get out of the Navy
 probably be another twelve years
 you know I like what I'm doing right now 
 Excuse me
 If they pay for a P H D
 Nah 
 they won't pay for it 
 They've I think they have maybe two people a year go get get their P H D 
 Yeah 
 They civilians or military
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Well a lot of times it's you know a lot of times it's not the money that keeps pe- that keeps people in 
 They they like what they're doing 
 They you know they feel good about what they're doing 
 That type of thing 
 It's more 
 Uh-huh 
 easily 
 I'm sure 
 No 
 Well it depends on what rank you are of course 
 like I say if you're if you're you know if you're at an upper level in the rank category you know you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year
 Yeah 
 Those are few and far between though 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Since I imagine it's fairly competitive 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Too many chiefs and not enough Indians 
 Yeah 
 I don't know 
 that can be that that can really slow you down
 I didn't realize that
 Uh-huh
 push paper around 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 They've got a they've got basically a you know a lock on a lot of the market
 And a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know 
 people generally go with that because they figure that the you know you probably won't get fired for getting I B M material 
 Where's if you try something different they'll they'll say yeah 
 why didn't you buy why didn't you try something more mainline 
 No 
 Uh-huh
 
 Illegal or something like that 
 yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh 
 So in other words that's the way they force people out 
 That's why they can say you know there's no layoff policy 
 But it does- they don't really say that you know 
 you're you're always going to have great career conditions 
 He- hey that's kind of sad 
 No
 Well they're the standard right now 
 Or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of I B M a lot of times 
 And the main 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
