 Okay 
 what baseball team are you familiar with
 Really
 now come on 
 no Texas Rangers
 Really 
 I guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later 
 but I understand a little bit about the Texas Rangers 
 I know George Bush threw out the first pitch hitter bounced off the ground 
 and that 
 yeah 
 I heard a joke on the radio yesterday that in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system
 and the radio's kind of cruel 
 think the he this chain that must have been on President Bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground 
 goll- how humiliating for a man to do that any man 
 I don't care if you're President
 I know 
 but he's a man 
 come on 
 men know how to do that right
 I know so 
 I felt kind of sorry for him 
 that must have been hard on him because he's just a person 
 but I never 
 a major owner of our t- of the team here 
 Yeah 
 he's like I thought he was the owner 
 but it turns out my Mom said that he's part owner 
 but he must own the biggest chunk 
 because that's all you hear about is if you know about Neal Bush I think is his name
 See I even know his name because he's on the news a lot 
 and I never had to watch the news not you know not like some people hour and a half a day or anything
 Uh-huh
 I saw that
 Yeah
 I want to see your driver's lic- 
 I I I don't 
 you're not President Bush 
 I know 
 and he said 
 yeah 
 it does so fast 
 I heard it on the radio 
 I heard the audio portion on the radio in the car 
 but I didn't see it 
 but 
 That's about my extent of about baseball 
 I don't know that much about it
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Did they
 Uh-huh
 That's so stupid that you all have two teams
 That's really stupid
 Yeah 
 I know
 Yeah
 The Texas Rangers they they lost I think
 But I know that last year 
 we did go to a baseball game last year 
 We got free tickets because someone at our church one of the deacons at church parks cars at The Mansion at Turtle Creek which is like one of the the places and stuff
 And he's their head chauffeur 
 is this funny as they're parking the cars the valet service
 Yeah 
 he makes good money too doing that 
 you'd be sh- I was shocked 
 but anyway someone gave an Iranian a tip of four Rangers tickets last year
 and then the Iranian couldn't 
 he didn't want them 
 so he gave them to Alan 
 and Alan and his Dad had plans that night 
 so they gave them to us 
 so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this Iranian with baseball tickets 
 and we ended up with them right 
 And so we were walking up 
 and I looked at my husband 
 and I said you know what Kyle this is The Mansion at Turtle Creek a tip 
 I bet these are really good seats 
 and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor
 yeah 
 we they called us at five 
 and the game started at seven 
 so we just threw everything together ran over and got the tickets and walked 
 and so we took two kids with us 
 and nobody brings two children in these seats you know because 
 yeah 
 and you just sit down 
 and all the girls were all dressed up you know 
 I just was there you know 
 like I'm loaded 
 I'm here you know 
 and it was just kind of funny 
 because you know but we got to sit by first base 
 if they did hit a ball I would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in you know
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Really
 I'm glad my husband's not like that
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That's funny
 You miss the whole thing
 That's funny
 Where is he from in France
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I have a I had a friend in college from Strasbourg
 Uh-huh
 Paris 
 And my cousin lives in Paris 
 and she's lived there for like off and on for twenty years
 Uh-huh
 Saint Claude is that sound familiar
 Yeah
 really
 Uh-huh
 That's neat 
 Yeah 
 she married 
 and they have twelve children
 She has twelve children
 She looks gorgeous 
 no 
 she's gorgeous 
 and she just liked having kids 
 and she's thin 
 and four or more children are thin 
 I'm not kidding you
 No 
 your 
 I have a friend now that has seven 
 And and they're all eight and under and nine and under 
 they're all real young 
 they're just raised right 
 that's what God's told them to do 
 but they're not condemning you 
 if you 
 we only have one child you know 
 they don't say they don't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy I'm sure for them to do that 
 you get a conviction like that 
 and you think everyone should have it 
 And so I'm real proud of them because they're aren't really they don't do that at all
 You go in their bathroom 
 and there's ten tooth brushes in there 
 And I always give her a hard time who's toothbrush did you really use this morning 
 Uh-huh
 They live lean for one thing 
 and they tithe 
 and they 
 it puts a whole in your money bag 
 *[[spelling: hole]] we don't honor God with this portion 
 and so they 
 I think that helps a lot 
 I think that's the key in he like his sales last year 
 he just works a normal job 
 He probably has an income of thirty-five thousand 
 but last year he made 
 that got him a bonus of twenty-five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van
 He loves God 
 it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done
 and he got to do it 
 and so God just really blesses him in ways like that 
 do trust God because I don't know kids are a blessing 
 and and some people you know we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that 
 but kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things 
 but it's a different kind 
 and a lot times people think well I'm not blessed 
 I have an old car 
 But you've got five kids you know
 you're just as blessed probably more because if you follow this 
 there's a good book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING by Richard Fugate 
 and he's you know 
 a lot of wisdom in it 
 And the kids at BIBLE talk about anything 
 but training and training is different than anything else 
 in in psychology doesn't address it 
 A lot of the psychology stuff the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the BIBLE 
 and they don't quote you the proverb out of it 
 but the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work they just come out of the BIBLE 
 and so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child 
 so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen
 What how to train them so they're going to be a blessing 
 and so you know they do that 
 and they they just live lean pretty much 
 they don't she doesn't shop at Foley's you know and stuff like that 
 But a lot women die or shop at Foley's 
 so things 
 It's like a Macy's kind of store 
 it's pretty nice 
 and everything's pretty expensive 
 and you know you just can't do that 
 and you don't go to baseball games as much 
 or you get pictures like we did 
 You know what I mean
 You do these fun things you know in other kinds of ways 
 and I know Manhattan's real expensive 
 but it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment right
 Yeah
 Well church softball leagues 
 so 
 they're not all boys 
 and right now we don't have a girls' league because I'm the one that's supposed to start one 
 and I just haven't gotten around to doing it 
 I keep saying we need to have one 
 They go okay then start one 
 But everybody wants to do it 
 but you know God's sitting on my heart 
 and I just hadn't gotten around to doing it 
 but anyway so they could really only have four members on the team 
 I think they only have four boys 
 I don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet
 But then you didn't believe me about her kids 
 *[[listen: this and utt2 as one utt]] are the they are so good 
 I'm not kidding you 
 but she does work with them 
 and it's a commitment 
 and that that's what they're called to do
 I have a 
 most of my friends 
 I know 
 I do too 
 I most of my friends have three or four kids 
 and they feel like you know that's really why God 
 and some of the people in our church use birth control 
 and some of them don't 
 I had my tubes tied 
 so you
