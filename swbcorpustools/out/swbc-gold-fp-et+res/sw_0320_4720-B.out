 Right
 and if you try to get it outside of your corporation you're going to pay an arm and a leg
 Right 
 do you also get dental
 I know
 Now my husband is with Northwest Airlines 
 and he gets you know the full health and dental 
 and we have four children 
 and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous
 And I don't know how people that don't have it can afford it
 Or maybe they don't 
 That's right 
 That's right 
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Right 
 Well it's a lot easier to to save it when you don't get your hands on it first 
 Right
 what about what about lesser benefits perhaps for you but for for the women in the in the corporation 
 For example 
 Yeah
 Do they e- even do they have father leaves or anything like that
 Uh-huh
 I do too
 I think I think it's just a crying shame for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks
 She isn't recovered 
 And the infant needs her desperately at that point and time
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 I agree
 sure
 Especially in this day and age
 You don't want to start over again anywhere
 Well I think they're at they're com- they've come a long way at least some companies Some of them my girlfriend in particular that works for a a rental car agency 
 and as manager and they have a very very poor leave policy 
 and I just don't know how how women do it 
 Particularly single parents who don't have the support at the other end 
 That's right 
 That's exactly right 
 Right
 Uh-huh
 One of the benefits we get of course is travel 
 It's wonderful 
 The only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere 
 but you can't afford to stay once you get there 
 That's right 
 You have to have an awful lot of fun 
 just just getting there is has to be half the fun
