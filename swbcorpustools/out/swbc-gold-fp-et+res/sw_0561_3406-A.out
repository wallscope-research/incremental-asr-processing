 So what do you think is the the worst culprit for air pollution
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I I 
 it's hard to put the finger on what's worse you know the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion with your hydrocarbons causing the damage in which 
 Well I notice on one of these home shopping networks they were selling these halogen fire extinguishers
 and the halogen is an ozone depleter 
 and it got hydrocarbons in there 
 It's a very clean fire extinguisher 
 but it's you know really bad on the environment
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I know 
 in the Twin Cities area 
 I just moved out of there and was kind of happy I timed it just right

 and 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 I guess that was just mainly in the cities there 
 and as far as where I live I don't have to do that 
 but I have an old car which I doubt would would pass the inspection a seventy-six 
 and you know there's no way I would put in a lot of money to to repair it to meet standards
 Yeah

 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well well around here I we get 
 well it depends you know 
 either in the in the winter time it it blows it your way 
 and in the summer time we probably get yours
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 well it th- that's a big thing too 
 I know it has nothing to do with air pollution 
 but I kind of look at the way people treat our
