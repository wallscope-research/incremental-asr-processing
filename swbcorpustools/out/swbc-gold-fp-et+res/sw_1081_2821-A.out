 Yes
 Okay
 No 
 I haven't 
 is that good
 It- it's not my favorite 
 but I like it's okay
 Uh-huh
 That's okay 
 Uh-huh
 Oh 
 that sounds really good
 Yeah 
 Well are there just the two of you
 Okay 
 well when my husband and I go out we have four children
 So that makes a difference 
 For us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can 
 the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best
 But we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive 
 so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price an- and feed the whole family and like that
 Right 
 Right 
 but when my husband and I go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere 
 and we usually head on down what's the freeway down here
 Yeah
 And there are all along that that freeway there are restaurant 
 but one of our favorites is Pappasito's
 No 
 we love to go there 
 You know it always kills me cause I don't like the the decorations so much 
 it's too 
 Yeah 
 But I love the food I love the food 
 the food is great 
 Yeah 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh 
 I like to get that 
 a shrimp it's a shrimp dish
 and I don't remember the name of it
 but it's rolled up into into something 
 and it's really good
 Yeah 
 they are really good
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it's very expensive
 Yeah 
 Sometimes it's hard isn't it to keep a 
 No 
 sometimes Mark and I that's my husband Mark go to the August Moon which is down there 
 it's a Chinese restaurant with the lions in the front
 yeah 
 and it's pretty good as far as Chinese 
 but Chinese isn't my favorite 
 so 
 But he likes it kind of 
 so he heats us up a good fight 
 now me I'm like I said seafood I'm 
 I like that
 So 
 
 Oh 
 Uh-huh
 Is it 
 how nice
 Yeah
 I don't know that place 
 Was it
 
 That's what we need isn't it
 No 
 there's a lot of nice barbecue places here 
 now I like barbecue okay Texas barbecue
 It's good 
 Yeah 
 now they're real good 
 They are good
 Yeah 
 free ice cream 
 yeah
 Yeah
 Oh 
 Just to die for exactly
 Oh 
 In heaven 
 Well my two littlest 
 I just had a baby
 and she's six months 
 and then my four year old he he still 
 but my other older two they can 
 So they're they're kind of 
 my littlest girl she's still like wants McDonald's McDonald's McDonald's 
 I'm telling you
 Well it's kind of funny is sometimes we're like we all want different things
 and so there's a H Avenue down here and along are these fast food restaurants 
 So we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing
 and then we go to park over there so we can all have our own
 that's on the nights we can't decide 
 Well five of them they're good kids
 how nice
 It will be neat
 Food's food 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 You have to be careful if you go to a a restaurant that that really is more adults you know with the atmosphere and everything 
 they 
 if you're 
 like we could probably take our oldest son and and our oldest daughter
 And they know how to act
 I don't think I would chance it with my younger ones because they're just too much of a distraction 
 and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing
 Yeah
 So 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Oh
 Is it Tia's not Tia's 
 Yeah 
 I know which one it is 
 and I can't think of it
 dear
 It was one of these you have bad experience and say I don't think I'll come back here
 dear
 Oh
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah
 Well I I've got selv- 
 one of my favorites were 
 and I can't really think of any other places
 Yeah 
 you have to watch it if you go out to eat 
 that's true
 Yeah 
 there you go
 Well good luck
 Yeah 
 maybe
 Okay 
 Bye-bye
