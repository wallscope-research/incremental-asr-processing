 Hi
 Hi 
 I'm Jennifer
 Pennsylvania
 really
 that's neat
 television shows
 Sure 
 that sounds good
 Okay
 Sure am
 Okay 
 I guess we're recording now
 What are your favorite television shows
 really
 I love that show
 Yes 
 that is great
 I heard they just canceled that
 I read in today's paper they just canceled that show
 Have you seen the show it's it's new this year called HOME FRONT
 it's it's really good 
 It's I think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven
 and it's set in post World War Two times 
 and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through 
 It's really interesting
 It's kind of like a s- a nighttime soap opera type thing
 It is it's a good it's really well written
 I don't even know to tell you the truth 
 I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE 
 Oh
 I did watch soap operas 
 but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore Except when I'm home sick 
 and now when I watch them I think why did I ever watch those
 They're stupid 
 So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day
 But not anymore
 tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS
 Yes 
 I like that show
 And if I can stay up late enough I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then
 And right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live
 So 
 It's exciting 
 we're winning 
 so that's really exciting
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 we watch C N N in morning while we're getting ready for the day and eating breakfast 
 We'll catch our news that way 
 Watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like
 Lately I haven't been catching it because of my work schedule
 <> I can't remember the last time I saw it 
 It's been a while
 I don't know 
 sometimes they come on and and say
 Well today on C N N they were talking about something like this about learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing helping them get a data base for words
 It was really interesting
 Do you work for Texas Instruments
 that's nice
 Sure 
 because we we've talked to a lot of people from Texas it seems 
 and we thought well maybe they work from for Dallas
