 I'm from Maryland 
 and I have one son who's almost sixteen months old 
 Are are you married or 
 You are
 Oh
 That's good 
 what kind of things do you do
 Oh 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 it's really nice 
 my husband is working mo- you know most of the time 
 He's working long hours 
 but I'm staying home
 I'm just working a couple days a month 
 and 
 we spend a lot of time at the playground 
 and we go to the zoo 
 and we go 
 and we wa- 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 I'm a nurse
 So yeah 
 so it's it's it's real easy to work out my schedule you know to get in to to still stay in with that an and to have enough time to spend with Matthew
 He he's just now really starting to to get interested in a lot of things 
 so 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 That's right 
 and I think a lot of people are are turning to well I think I think a lot of people are realizing that 
 but still there are so many people that are you know have their careers first 
 and it's I think it's really hurting the kids you know 
 but 
 I know 
 That's why I like to to to work a couple days 
 I think it's it gives me a break
 Most of the time at home 
 yeah
 we had started out like that 
 and I think that was really ideal 
 It's 
 yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 it's difficult 
 but 
 Uh-huh 
 I'm I've I've lived here forever 
 so 
 Yeah 
 I live in Germantown 
 and 
 Are you where are you from
 In Dallas 
 oh
 yea-
 Okay 
 oh 
 so that explains 
 Well I don't know 
 I we we do a lot of things on the weekends together the family
 but as far as during the week it's it's usually you know just my son and I 
 and we're 
 he he works for Coca Cola
 So he he manages a plant out here
 an and it takes a lot of time
 But it you know 
 we take walks and go to the library and try to fill our day with things like that 
 but 
 Oh
 Oh
 Yeah 
 Right
 That's good 
 that's good 
 I know my husband was real 
 in the beginning when he he was transferred to a a larger plant 
 and he he works about an hour and a half away from here from our home 
 and so it takes him a little bit of time
 And I'm not able to work during the week because of that 
 He was I was working in the evening
 and he was coming home 
 and I I could go to work 
 but their relationship when I was able to work in the evenings really grew
 He you know 
 just the time that they were spending together 
 I think it it really it really helped to have that time together
 yeah 
 he has he has seven other brothers and sisters
 and they have we have thirteen grand 
 well his parents have thirteen grandchildren
 So it's you know there's a lot of kids in the family 
 and and he really enjoys it
 But right now it's kind of a difficult time 
 but 
 And and the cost of living here is just so tremendously you know outrageous 
 it's difficult to do it any other way
 Yeah
 That's right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 at least I I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home 
 It 
 I know 
 I know
 Yeah
 Yeah
 yeah 
 it has
 I believe that too 
 and I think the kids are where they need to you know 
 they need to really focus on the children in the wor- in this country 
 No 
 I didn't I didn't even really think about it that much you know
 I I was aware vaguely aware of it 
 but I didn't it wasn't really that important to me 
 and 
 it it really does 
 I 
 just the whole you know 
 seeing how you really are cre- are are forming this you know the mind 
 That's right
 Yeah
 Or or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide
 I I've seen a lot of people just say well you know he'll learn everything when he gets into you know 
 but it 
 I I know 
 even just this first year that I've been with my son h- here he's 
 I can just see how much of of a difference it makes staying home with him instead of 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Well it's nice talking to you too
 Okay
