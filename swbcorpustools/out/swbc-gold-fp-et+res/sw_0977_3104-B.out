 How many 
 you said yours are all 
 that sounds like an army
 lord
 That is an army 
 I came from a family of six
 and I have only got two 
 and they are one 
 Well I kind of decided that single single children that that that's not parenting 
 that's a hobby
 But 
 Well do not tell that to all my friends
 They are into quality time
 I am into getting through the day
 <> Well I I I can spot a kid who really you know whose parents spend every quality time with them you know outside of the work day
 And when I take care of some people's kids you know 
 when they when they have teachers' holidays and that kind of stuff I will take my friends' kids that are usually in day care
 and you can spot them because they have no idea how to hang out and mess around
 Yeah
 Really
 It's not a problem for my two 
 they are only eighteen months apart 
 They can find things to do and mess around and plot and scheme and everything else
 You did all five of yours complete college
 Well how did you go about selecting a college then 
 Do you think that what they say that they are interested in is at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 How about the other four other three who went
 Uh-huh
 When they were like in junior high and high school had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and 
 Uh-huh
 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I was I was making more than I was making three times what my father was making as an executive in the insurance industry when he retired
 Yeah
 I went four years to undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln because Lincoln is where where my parents live
 And there really there really was not a choice
 the finances dictated that you had to go there
 I kind of 
 I am not going to say I resent it
 but I was well you know one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the Rhodes Scholars kids and the whole bit 
 my parents did not even discuss with me going to college out of state or anyplace else 
 and I just knew that the finances you know would not support it
 If I had known how not I am not going to say easy but how much less difficult than I thought it would be to get a scholarship to go anyplace else I think that I would definitely you know have gone 
 Now when I finished there then I got a scholarship to go the Harvard University in Boston
 And that was I think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened 
 I was taken out of my element you know the homogeny midwest which is a lovely place to grow up and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently you know different life style 
 And I think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me
 Now my kids I keep saying that you know I would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could
 And I do not know you know what the realities you know is going to look like you know 
 we are putting money away already
 but I really think it's important to put these children someplace where in addition to you know them getting an education they really need a you know a socialization away from what they are raised in Especially if you lived a pretty insular community 
 and An upper class suburb of Dallas let me tell you It's very different
 You should not
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Uh-huh
