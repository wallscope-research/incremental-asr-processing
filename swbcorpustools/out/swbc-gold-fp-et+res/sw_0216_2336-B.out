 Well none at the moment 
 No 
 no 
 no 
 I currently drive a a Ford Taurus
 And I would ima- I would imagine that if I change or if I get another car a new car I will go with the Taurus or something similar in that regard
 Absolutely 
 I have had it for about two years now
 and it's it's everything it's supposed to be 
 I haven't had a minutes trouble with it
 and the only thing I have against it in that's it's a Taurus 
 but I still feel a little even after two years I still feel uncomfortable driving it because I had a Honda before that
 and so it's a little bit larger
 But that's the only the only difference that I see really 
 But I would 
 my my criteria would be at the moment it would be American personally 
 an- 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well my wife drives a still has a a Honda Accord 
 and it's a very it's an excellent automobile And but you know price and so forth 
 I'm not a real car fan 
 So I I I do not opt for something that would be you know expensive you know 
 I want I want something that's serviceable serviceable something that I can use
 and and I 
 and with the Taurus 
 I have a Taurus L X 
 and it's you know 
 you're talking when you think about price it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines
 And as I said as far I'm concerned it it has been extremely serviceable and everything I wanted
 Uh-huh
 I think so too 
 Now I you know 
 in travel and renting automobiles in 
 I've driven you know Chevrolet automobiles and so for- and Dodge 
 and I 
 if it's Chevrolet I just will not touch it
 I had a Chevrolet before I bought my Taurus 
 I purchased a a Chevy Citation
 And I was ready to get rid of it two months after I bought it
 And so I I shopped around 
 and I would I probably if I had thought I wanted to pay the amount of money I probably would have gone with an Accord or even a a Civic or something comparable from Nissan or Toyota 
 and but it was just 
 I had I have a friend who has a an auto shop 
 and he purchased one of the first Sables that was manufactured for his wife a Sable station wagon 
 and he just absolutely swore by it
 And it was upon his recommendation and so forth for you know comparable comparably equipped you know with cruise control and air conditioning and A M F M radio and all these other things
 it was just 
 there was no there was no comparison 
 the only thing that I find you know if I would have anything against it is that it still has that soft American ride
 not 
 that's about the only thing I find you know disadvantageous to it 
 But my criteria is simply something that looks good something that's serviceable 
 and I you know I drive around a lot 
 but and it's you know it's very comfortable on the highway 
 I can drive for you know ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way
 But those are my criteria 
 and I I probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again 
 and if there's something out there that is comparable to what I have now I'll go ahead and get it
 Uh-huh
 I 
 yeah
 In our parking lots two or three days ago I saw one of the new Honda sports cars
 I I can't remember what the name is 
 It's the thirty-five or forty thousand dollar one whatever it is 
 and it looked it resembled a Mazaratti <> very very closely 
 And it's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth 
 but to pay that much money for an automobile is just 
 I can't I can't conceive of doing that 
 Uh-huh
 That's true Well
 The difference there is too is between us is that I am not really crazy about driving
 I never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when I was young when I was sixteen 
 So I've never really cared 
 Now what I was you know 
 before I was married and before I went to graduate school I used to do little sports car racing 
 I never it was never my own car
 it was always someone else's 
 And that sort of thing I enjoy 
 but to go out and drive never has really been had any appeal to me in that regard 
 So Well I guess we've discussed that enough 
 don't you think
 We won't we don't we won't get the recorder or the system to shut us off tonight 
 That's happened to me almost every time I've 
 Well it's very easy when you get a top- you get on a topic that you know you enjoy
 yeah
 Well I was talking to a lady last evening 
 and we were talking about fishing 
 and we were cut off well 
 we were told to quit
 Okay 
 Well you have a pleasant evening
 Take care
 Good-bye
