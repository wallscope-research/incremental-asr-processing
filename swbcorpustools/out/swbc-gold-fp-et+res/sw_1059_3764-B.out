 Yes 
 I certainly did
 Uh-huh
 Well about the same I dress for school 
 I I am a graduate student 
 so I don't have to worry too much about what I wear too much of the time Which is nice 
 although I do a lot of 
 I am a speech pathology major 
 and so I do a lot of clinical work 
 and when I do clinic work then I have to look my best
 Yeah
 Unfortunately
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 sure
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 do you find that on the average do people give more credibility or less credibility to a professional to professionally dressed individual 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 really
 Even the farmers
 wow
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 certainly
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 it depends 
 Sure

 if you had the choice would you wear a tie or not
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right

 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 that 
 if if you wanted to really get into a hot issue 
 well at least in some in some beliefs how people dress when they go to church is is sometimes a pretty pretty hot topic
 un- un- un- unfortunately Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 I'm I am I go to the Church of Christ 
 I have been raised in the Church of Christ 
 and but I too many times you hear you hear a lot about what what you're supposed you're supposed to look your Sunday best and dress and proper attire

 You know people just don't have that 
 and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because they don't have the clothes to wear
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Certainly
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 a little bit 
 of course in the summer if I can get away with it I wear a pair of shorts 
 and that's it 
 Run around barefoot no shirt or anything 
 But
