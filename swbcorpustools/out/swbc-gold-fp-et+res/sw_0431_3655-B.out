 well my my feelings on it is I wouldn't take a child to day-care You know
 I'd I'd wind up 
 just a baby-sitter in a home 
 
 Well too many kids and and I think too many infections and things coming in
 Yeah 
 sicknesses and 
 I don't know 
 then all the things you hear about them 
 Yeah 
 I'm sure there's some good ones 
 but I just 
 I don't think that I would 
 uh-huh
 yeah 
 yeah
 How was it
 Oh
 She went
 she did
 Wrapping her arm all the way around
 Yeah
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Well they'd never picked it out though
 
 Or just never said anything
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Well one thing that's kind of different too though a preschool than than taking a a infant or to at a day-care where they're taken care of 
 Yeah 
 yeah
 Well I think it's hard to leave them 
 it is
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 it it is I think just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will
 Yeah 
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah 
 it is 
 Yeah 
 well the work never ends
 That's for sure
 So 
 
 Uh-huh 
 or is everything okay
