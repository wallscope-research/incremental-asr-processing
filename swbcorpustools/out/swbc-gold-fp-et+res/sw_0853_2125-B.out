 Well a little bit 
 noth- nothing overly strenuous 
 No 
 the majority of my camping experience is a tent by the lake type situation or maybe a canoe trip or something like that
 it it's 
 we've had a lot of fun 
 I I moved to Dallas about five years ago 
 and we've made three different trips since I've been here The group of friends that I run around with of varying degrees of difficulty 
 The the last one we did and we haven't had a chance to duplicate was was a canoe trip in Arkansas 
 and the river was it was up about three feet 
 so it was it was pre- it was pretty challenging
 But and then we 
 as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and find find a clearing in the woods and go for it
 Well yeah 
 yeah 
 it's the 
 that that particular one was a two day trip 
 so what 
 there's there's a outfitter 
 and they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you get to you spend the night 
 and then the second day head on down to the to the pool at the end of the river
 Yeah 
 it it really is
 Okay
 Okay
 Right 
 right
 Okay
 Boy I bet 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 that's that was that's always been our next step 
 Our our little group of friends here we've been kind of getting married off and what not 
 but 
 Yeah 
 that 
 well it it just puts a damper on things for a little while
 But we're we're starting to get everybody back together 
 Yeah 
 we'd like to do a float trip down like Big Bend area or something like that
 No 
 no 
 we haven't made that trip yet
 I'll bet 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 exactly
 not really just yet 
 We've 
 well I I do have a little bit of property 
 I grew up in South Dakota
 and I've got a piece of property in Minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet 
 There's there's a little lake up there 
 and a group of friends that I I went to college with got together 
 and we basically own all the land around this little lake there 
 it's divided up into ten lots
 So we've got a private lake 
 and it's completely undeveloped at this point 
 so that's a possibility 
 And the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime 
 It it's it's about two hours north of Minneapolis
 So yeah 
 in fact 
 well I got married last summer 
 and that's that's 
 we ended up there for a couple days on our honeymoon 
 We kind of took a tour of the United States for about a week and up through that area 
 But my wife's real excited about it 
 so we're we're going to hope to get up there sometime early eno- 
 last year it was the end of July 
 and it was a little too late for the fish 
 but hopefully get up there early enough to to get into some of the some of the fish and the the good weather and what not
 Uh-huh
 gosh 
 yeah 
 yeah
 That's right
 Sure
 Right
 You bet 
 yeah 
 we'll that you know 
 and there's a lot of places with like nature trails things like that where they could learn a lot too
 You know it's like okay this this is this is what a pheasant looks like you know 
 and okay now we'll go look for one
 Well yeah 
 that's 
 ever- everybody might learn something that way 
 but but yeah 
 that's 
 there is there's an awful lot of things set up you know just any anything you want to do 
 Like like you say it can be a water ski trip or fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching you know hunt hunt with a camera type of thing 
 or there's a lot of different opportunities for things like that 
 It's a lot of fun 
 it really is
