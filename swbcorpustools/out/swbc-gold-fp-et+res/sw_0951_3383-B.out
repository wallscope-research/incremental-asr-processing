 Yeah 
 Isn't the the subject auto repair for tonight 
 Yeah 
 That's great 
 The reason I say that is pretty timely because just tonight I went out and changed the oil in my car
 and that's something I like to do and something I something I can do with now the sophisticated auto cars we have today with all the computers and everything
 It's and there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car 
 but I do like to get out and tinker with a car 
 and it's something I can do still 
 Do you enjoy working with your car
 dear
 that's too bad
 Oh
 yes
 Oh
 And did you install all that yourself
 Well that was I bet that was a lot of fun
 Uh-huh
 Wow
 Do you still have the car
 Well that's too bad 
 A sixty-seven Chev- Mustang is about the top top year for the Mustang car
 Yes
 
 Yeah
 Well you know that's that's fine 
 I I don't think that there would be you know a a quality difference 
 I don't know 
 You wouldn't you didn't notice the difference did you
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 dear
 Uh-huh
 dear
 I bet that was frustrating wasn't it
 Right 
 right
 Yeah 
 that's that's true 
 Well you know that that is something I really enjoy doing working on our car too 
 the I just changed my oil oil tonight 
 but I enjoy also working on things like the brakes 
 and in fact just two weeks ago I helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car 
 And either if it's a drum or or disc brakes I enjoy working on those kind of things
 Yeah 
 Spoons and 
 Yes 
 you do 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 that's true 
 And you know it it doesn't doesn't hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too 
 because I was helping my neighbor out 
 and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced 
 and I don't have of course the equipment to do that
 so he took it into a shop and had it resur- resurfaced and and fixed that way 
 But yeah 
 it is true you know 
 I did have a sixty-four Ford truck that I wish I still had and loved to get inside that and tinker around with it and work with it because you didn't have all the extra extra stuff that's in there now
 yeah
 And you know
