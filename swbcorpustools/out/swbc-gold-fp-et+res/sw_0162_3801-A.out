 Well got any problems on Mockingbird with crime 
 or is that a crime free zone there
 I'm afraid you're right
 my
 boy
 By your house
 my goodness
 my 
 That's that's got to be a frightening way to spend an evening
 boy
 Unfortunately yes
 Yes
 I think you know as any city grows up you get the hoods and the roof- riffraff and everybody else in there 
 and I think 
 you know fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek 
 but we've been we've lived here sixteen years 
 and now you you know you can tell the change for sure
 Yes
 Well with all the Central Expressway with all the stores and the restaurants and the convenience stores and all that kind of stuff it's just prime pickings for people driving by
 You know and 
 That's that couldn't be too far from you neither
 Okay
 yes 
 okay
 I don't know how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody 
 but 
 It's kind of kind of stupid isn't it
 But I guess when people do those things they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time 
 It's looks like easy pickings 
 and away you go right
 I think you're right although I think that may be an excuse for people too
 Right
 Right
 Right 
 just like the old alcohol idea 
 and I think people I think when you have haves and have nots you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money
 boy 
 Where do you work
 yes 
 I think I do 
 That is that Amelia Earharthart School there
 Okay
 That's a pretty rough area there isn't it
 my goodness
 
 Definitely that area that that's big time
 Big time there sure is
 I don't think I'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself 
 Gee- 
 that's the worst neighborhood in the whole c- area
