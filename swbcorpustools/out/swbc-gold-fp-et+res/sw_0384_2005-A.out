 Okay 
 first I need to know how do you feel about about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home
 Yes 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 Probably the hardest thing in in my family my grandmother she had to be put in a nursing home 
 and she had used the walker for for quite some time probably about six to nine months 
 And she had a fall 
 and finally she had Parkinson's disease
 and it got so much that she could not take care of her house
 Then she lived in an apartment 
 and that was even harder actually
 Because it was you know it was just a change of change of location 
 and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling
 she tr- she had she had children all across the United States
 and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children
 And that was pretty heart-rending for her
 I think when she finally came to the realization that you know no I cannot I cannot take care of myself
 Yeah 
 for somebody who is you know for most of their life has has not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines
 And you know facing that situation it's it's quite a dilemma
 I think 
 Yeah 
 Well my my 
 probably one of the biggest decisions I think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision than just delegate it 
 I think that they they had a great deal of 
 all the brothers and sisters got together 
 and they actually had a conference
 And it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family getting down together and doing that
 And and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them And you know making that decision and then finding a place 
 and everybody had duties to perform 
 You know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot of the decision making you know like finding a proper nursing home
 And they 
 I know 
 They and well they had well they had they had seen it coming
 So so 
 it 
 I I I I har- I I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well we we 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Well with my with my grandmother I think it was it was such that that she did not have the problem with 
 she was very well aware 
 and her daughter came and visited her
 at least her daughter came and visited her and also her several grandchildren came and visited her every day
 And I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest 
 I I I think it would be 
 it was more of a relief for her
 And 
 but she was truly she was truly aware 
 I I I di- I don't know how I would how I would deal if one of my parents came with with Alzheimer's or something like that which is which is far more devastating
 And I I I think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care 
 That the people that worked there were very were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible
 I think I think I think you know for myself I I see that as probably the the what everything would hinge upon
 Is it 
 how close is it to a home environment
 That's the that's probably the major question
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 You know it's it's interesting that that a lot the population of the United States is changing because you know now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time
 matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families
 It wasn't
 But I guess as we become more industrialized and more you know less in a rural situation we we don't we we we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I I I think that perhaps perhaps the extended family you know that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care
 You know of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like are going to be a good they're going to be a good caretaker for our children
 But 
 they raised us after all
 Yeah 
 But I I I think that you know we always I've I've had a lot of good experiences with with many many people especially where they've had extended family 
 And I and I I kind of see that that you know perhaps you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know 
 it's 
 money seems to be too big of an issue With with with with what's going on today 
 and I I think I think that we may not that may be you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem
 we may not we may not have as high a standard of living
 but the qua- but actually have a truer standard of living
 Yeah 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Okay 
 Well I guess that was it 
 Okay
 All right
 Hey
 Bye-bye
