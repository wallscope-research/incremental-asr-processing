 well you know I think public service is a worthy thing 
 and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs such as Peace Corps that promote that
 Probably the most popular one but one that is not typically recognized as such is the Boy Scouts
 I know that f- because my son is a a scout now and is thinking about his Eagle 
 and in order to get Eagle you have to have merit badges in citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world 
 and you have to do a public service project in which leadership is the key element 
 I <> I think the question is posed somewhat strangely because it's talking about a requirement for public service 
 and of course Pe- the Peace Corps the Boy Scouts is a o- is a voluntary activity
 
 Right 
 of course military service falls under the category of a public service
 And so one of the things that would fulfill the at least the nominal qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft
 
 but I agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended 
 There are other things such as civil service which many people are lifelong employees of
 but I suspect that was not what they had in mind either 
 More of a voluntary kind of thing 
 or 
 Uh-huh
 Why 
 Why is that 
 no 
 no 
 no 
 It's to defend the nation against external evils
 Well it depends on whether you whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive aggression oriented military
