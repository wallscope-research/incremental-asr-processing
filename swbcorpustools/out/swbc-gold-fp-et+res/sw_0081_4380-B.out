 Uh-huh
 Really 
 Yeah 
 I feel that my 
 I'm a junior in college now 
 And I go to Tech Georgia Tech
 And I 
 Okay 
 I've 
 the high school I went to was was a good one also 
 And I well I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools 
 Because the one I went to was you know I'm sure a a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta
 Yeah
 What d- 
 Yeah 
 that's true
 Yeah 
 And I'm also 
 in the in those places where like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that More than they would you know in areas where they 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 That's true 
 Right 
 Yeah
 That's hard for me to say since I didn't I didn't really grow 
 well when I went to elementary school it it wasn't in a great area 
 but I still I learned to read started learning to read when I was in kindergarten you know
 So I guess I can't really I can't say what it would be like to grow up in a really oppressed region 
 You know I guess the whole the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people 
 So I guess the problem is the the thing to do is to try to to get some kind of motivation to learn 
 and 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 No 
 I I can't say that I have either
 But 
 Yeah 
 I've I've heard some I've heard sta- sta- statistics and things that that compare a public education to a private education within like within the same income groups
 If you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know the people that did send their kids to private schools 
 I think they compare fair- you know fairly well
 Yeah
 I I I my schools there 
 I have a lot of 
 once once it seemed I got into high school they had a lot of accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that 
 That that makes a big difference 
 cause I wondered when they're taking classes with with people that are really are interested in the the subject and stuff like that 
 Uh-huh
