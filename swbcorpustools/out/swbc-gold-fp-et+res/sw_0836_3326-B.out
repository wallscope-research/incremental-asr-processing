 Oh
 Okay 
 well now see I've got two children 
 and they're 
 one is o- just turned to be a teenager 
 and the other one is on his way 
 so 
 I I'm a single parent 
 so I think it makes it more difficult for me to you know find time with my my children since I work 
 and then of course take care of the house a- and all this good kind of stuff 
 so it's a real it's a real problem for me
 Yeah
 the the thing that we like to do the most is to watch T V together
 And the kids like to play Nintendo 
 but I'm no good at it 
 so I don't like to play
 That's right 
 that's right
 Me either
 Yeah 
 they talk about these different levels and stuff 
 and I've never got off of level one 
 Yes
 I I know 
 I agree with you 
 so But no 
 the other thing I think we like to go to the movies too
 That's 
 yeah 
 that's a that's a neat thing 
 So I guess we're all in you know movie fanatics or whatever around here
 So we like to do those kind of things
 Uh-huh

 Uh-huh
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 see I have a son 
 and you know it's football in the fall and and baseball in the spring 
 and and it's one activity after another 
 I I'm constantly going back and forth
 Yeah 
 And my daughter has tennis 
 so it's between tennis and and bowling 
 My 
 I bowl 
 so you know we're pretty active as a sports you know in in the family 
 so It it's really neat
 Uh-huh
 Boys 
 yeah 
 I I know that my daughter even though she goes out with the the sports and everything yeah she likes to watch the football for the kids 
 I'm sorry
 that was a cat that hit the telephone
 Get away cat 
 gosh <> 
 I guess it's why they wanted to do it on this type of telephone because there's all kind of activity that goes on
 But yeah 
 my my kids are they're starting to grow up you know 
 It's not going to be too many more years before I you know they'll be gone 
 and and there won't be as many activities 
 Do you 
 Yeah 
 I I agree with you 
 I I do 
 I'm so glad they're out of the that young real young age 
 and the babies 
 Right
 Yes

 Boy I know especially when they grow up like that 
 so I'm trying to these last five or six years I'm trying to make them really special and very precious since that's about the only time we've got left
 Yes

 I I think so too
 Uh-huh

 There we go 
 I know I know they can't wait 
 That's right

 so I'm I'm hanging onto those and doing as much activity as I can with them
 Yes

 And I work full time 
 so it it 
 that cuts into our free time right there
 That's right 
 that's right 
 and vacations are very special for us and activities

 You know this being a school night and stuff 
 so it's it's in the same old y- you know routine of you know doing homework and you know trying to talk between all of that and and the other activities that we all have
