 Okay 
 So what do you think about it
 Privacy
 Right
 Well there is always the the possibility even remote as it is of of mistaken of 
 Yeah
 And see that bothers me 
 I'm I'm a I'm I'm very much for drug testing
 I really am 
 I'm going I'm going to take the negative side just for a second just to do it 
 see I have to take medication for a for for kidney transplant
 And I'm going to be taking that the rest of my life 
 Now you 
 I don't know how that's going to affect 
 Right
 I haven't had one yet 
 T I 
 I work for Texas Instruments
 and and we you know we do have the random drug testing 
 but I've missed it so far 
 But it in the back of my mind it always bothers me 
 And what happens if it you know if it if they catch it 
 they think that I'm you know I'm on drugs 
 and they send me and and have me you know go through this this thing you know 
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 Well I you know I'm like I said I'm I'm very much pro testing 
 and and this is why
 number one is I I'm I'm kind of 
 I know this sounds like a slogan for the government 
 but I you know we are in a war against drugs 
 it's it's horrible 
 you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not
 and it takes some drastic steps at this point 
 And I think personally the drastic step has to be that that you can't work if you continue taking drugs
 it's as simple as that 
 make it so Well make it ma- not necessarily difficult 
 but make it so that it's not glamorous
 it's glamorous taking drugs 
 or at least it seems that way
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Huh
 Right
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Well then 
 let's let's answer the second half of the question 
 What limits ought to be put on it do you think
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Treatment before for dismissal type thing
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Uh-huh
 Personally I think that's what I was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested
 It you know 
 That it could happen
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Well there's yeah there there's going to be some measure of incentive reward or whatever 
 but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want
 So I I've got to agree with that
 So 
 
 Yeah 
 I think so
 I think we I think we did pretty good
 Well all right 
 well I guess that's about it
 All right
 It was it was talk nice talking to you too
 All right 
 bye-bye
