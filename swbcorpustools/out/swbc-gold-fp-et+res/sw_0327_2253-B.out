 I just read for escape
 Well it's 
 Yes 
 It's that's simple 
 I read to escape 
 and I don't read any PARENTS magazines either
 So 
 Well I just finished just I just finished one last night A great book 
 It it's very a typical for my reading though but a great book one called THE THINGS THEY CARRIED by Tim O'Brien
 And it's 
 God 
 I don't know if I would call it a collection of Vietnam war stories or if I'd call it a collection of Vietnam love stories
 Strange book Beautifully written
 Just beautifully written
 Yeah 
 a guy who was there as a foot soldier
 So he considered himself to be you know a a true Vietnam soldier
 Yeah 
 So what's the latest one you've read
 Uh-huh
 I have never been able to make it through any of Michener's work
 Have you are you a Civil War buff at all
 Because I finished one 
 I think this is like two years ago 
 and somebody had given me one of these dinky do crappy women's novels set in the Civil War John Jakes with 
 and the novel didn't do that much for me 
 But boy the period of time was fascinating
 So I then read was it BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM
 or 
 yeah 
 I think it was BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM
 It's kind of like a historical compendium of the Civil War 
 and it's not a story of the Civil War 
 it's a story of all the politics and lobbying and just basically state by state events that lead to the events that brought about the Civil War 
 And it's fascinating because I had always you know been raised on this you know Emancipation Proclamation with the Civil War
 There was a lot more to it than that 
 As a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought
 yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well you know what else really surprised me now 
 I'm married to a native Texan 
 and I'm not
 
 yeah 
 I'm glad you put it that way
 And I have two native Texan children too
 My husband is always you know talked about th- Texas being a rebel state
 And my God all this Civil War pride 
 I kept waiting for 
 where's some reference to this goddamn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War
 They might as well have not even been there
 You know they weren't a state 
 and the only the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to you know who's going to be going there 
 And I keep telling my husband that 
 and he keeps saying no 
 I thought okay
 I'll bet they did
 Well you know why they actually held them off 
 None of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar 
 Now you didn't hear me say that 
 Outside of 
 Yeah
 Oh
 Boy 
 don't tell that to a native Texan though
 my god they fought and won the whole thing
 Oh
 That's a beautiful state 
 That's a beautiful state 
 See I was raised in the Midwest which you know hell we didn't even you know we didn't even know where the Mason Dixon Line was 
 and besides you know if corn didn't grow there it didn't matter
 Iowa and Nebraska
 Yep 
 And then I had probably lived the last eleven years in Massachusetts 
 so you know What does that make me an honorary Yankee 
 or God knows what
 Well then she's going to come out well rounded
 But outside of those kind of things you know the other thing that I've really gotten into reading 
 and I think this is because the kids are getting to me is science fiction
 Well I've gone to the point where my husband my husband travels I get out like you know two or three books
 And I I'm trying to think of Isaac Asimov ROBOT series
 I think I've read all four of them 
 and I understand that there's a fifth
 In the last six weeks he's been on the road a lot
 You know I think I read HAWAII when I was about ten years old 
 or so 
 Which is about the developmental level that you know you need to be at to read those things 
 and I still even then I was so so disgusted with it I I tried to read I don't remember which other one it was 
 whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller
 And I just I got about like a hundred pages through it and realized I had like a thousand more 
 I thought I can't do this
 Yeah
 No
 Is that a big thick book
 What the what the hell for 
 Why Kingsley Iowa
 okay
 Well 
 Now that's one that That's one 
 I don't know 
 See I had never really been into science fiction that much until somebody gave me MIST OF AVALON probably about five or six years ago
 I don't know if I'd call it science fiction or fantasy
 Well I loved that novel 
 And then somebody said God this would have been even long ago because I was in Boston 
 and it was raining all night 
 and I had a hole in my roof 
 and I was waiting for the whole house to collapse and I was reading DUNE Which seeming rather ironic
 And I read the whole damn book while I was home hauling out you know like ten-gallon buckets of of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits 
 and I think that's probably my favorite of of any piece of science fiction that I've ever read
 And the movie was awful
 yes 
 it was just terrible
 It was it was beyond 
 I don't know 
 I just remember Sting was in it
 Yeah 
 and if you were trying to follow any type of plot it it total- 
 even having read the book and I've read that book probably three times watching that movie I couldn't figure out what they were talking about at all
 I was real disappointed in that 
 Well I'll tell you another good book 
 do you like scary things
 Have you 
 That's true 
 Have you read THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
 Oh
 Well see I I am debating whether or not I want to go see the movie after having read the book
 the book is is chilling
 Just chilling
 Then I won't tell you
 It's just that if you're ever ever really want to just be scared out of your wits
 That's the one 
 Yes
 Yes 
 because the cat- the the character that is so horrible is another human being 
 And you're just drawn into his his horror of him that you begin to kind of like him
 
 No 
 no 
 This guy's smart 
 and he's suave 
 and he's all the charac- all the characteristics 
 yeah 
 all the characteristics
