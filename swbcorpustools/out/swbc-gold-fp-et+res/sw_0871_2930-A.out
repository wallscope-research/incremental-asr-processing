 There a lot of places to camp in Dallas
 Uh-huh 
 Do you do a lot of camping
 Uh-huh 
 Well that must have been fun though
 Uh-huh
 Well that sounds fun
 Yeah 
 we've done ours 
 I've only been camping twice
 And one of them I don't really consider camping
 It was on the edge of the lake 
 and it was at a camp 
 I don't like those camping grounds where you know you got R V beside you and then another people in tents beside you
 I just don't care for that
 Uh-huh 
 Right
 Well it doesn't 
 we 
 four years ago 
 it was about four years ago my little boy was three months old 
 and the first time I left him we went overnight camping
 And we went and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake 
 And we had a ball
 Just sat out there with our 
 we didn't even use tents then 
 we just had sleeping bags and fire going 
 And we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning
 it did 
 it did 
 I didn't even think about frying potatoes 
 But my sister-in-law she's always done a lot of camping
 And she's good 
 She'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out 
 And yeah
 Uh-huh
 Well sh- 
 yeah 
 she was she is always prepared 
 she brought everything from like I said toilet paper to the rake 
 The only thing we'd had to do we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill you know
 We and we and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped
 and we broke the I guess it's the freezing component
 and we broke that out of there and put it over our hole
 Yeah
 Well it held our pan and you know the potatoes and stuff 
 We had a good time
 Yeah 
 we're still waiting to go again
 Uh-huh
 Arkansas
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Uh-huh
 Pretty
 Well I love to swim 
 so I like to get out by a lake or a you know somewhere close where we can swim
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 How old are your boys
 so they don't go camping with you
 Oh
 Yeah 
 well I haven't taken my little boy yet
 I'm afraid to get him out 
 He is so fearless he it terrifies me
 He 
 Think so
 Well it's the water he's not scared of 
 He'll go out into it until it's up to his nose and then try to tread back 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 If you know what to look for
 Well that sounds so neat
 Yeah
 Well I'm impressed 
 My mother-in-law 
 and my 
 well they've always done a lot of camping 
 I grew up in Louisville Kentucky 
 and there wasn't 
 I don't know 
 but we just didn't get out 
 My mother and my father split up when we were young 
 so and my mother wasn't into that 
 and that's who I stayed with
 So we didn't do much outdoors stuff except swimming
 and we went swimming a lot
 And my baby's getting sick
 I know
 Yeah 
 I've got to clean her up 
 I'm sorry 
 appreciate it
 I enjoyed talking 
 Thank you
 Bye-bye
