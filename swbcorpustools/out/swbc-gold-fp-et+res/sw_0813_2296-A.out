 I try to ride the stationary bicycle every day about five miles
 and I love to walk 
 so if I have a lunch hour with nice weather I get out and and walk 
 What about you
 very good
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 there are there are lots of bike paths 
 I know my son is a biker 
 and he he's done the whole canal I think it's a hundred and eighty miles with the scouts
 And so but that somehow takes organization 
 For me it's much easier just the stationary bike 
 you know it's at home I can I can do some of my reading
 but 
 No 
 I live in Maryland
 Right 
 right 
 and that's it 
 at work we have a a nice campus 
 so I'm able to take advantage of of the environment here the neighborhood also 
 we're within walking distance of of stores and shops 
 so I do 
 Now I think 
 basically is your motive simply health or because you enjoy it
 Uh-huh 
 right 
 I think pretty much you summed up my my my motivations also
 well that's great 
 that's great
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 And actually in in summer I like to swim 
 We don't have facilities for swimming in winter 
 but and and that's true when I go home from work at the end of the day if I go up for an hour in the pool I'm much much more awake 
 I'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening
 So
 No 
 I'm not
 No
 really
 No 
 I don't know that 
 But I I must say that when when I did do a linguistics course in in school ages ago the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent
 And it's probably because I I I was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California 
 and at that point that was sort of the limit but since then I've been abroad a lot 
 so It's a mixture
 In Santa Barbara
 I see
 Uh-huh 
 Well very good 
 I think we've probably know know each other's exercise habits
 and it was nice talking to you
 okay
 Bye-bye
