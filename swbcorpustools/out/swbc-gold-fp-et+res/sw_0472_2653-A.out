 So I own a a P C A T at my home
 Well that's actually a good question 
 My wife works out of the home our home 
 She has an office 
 and in fact she sits in the office 
 and she uses it to compose and print out letters
 So that's a very regular use of it that she has
 And in addition to that I tinker around with it 
 I'm a computer scientist
 And so I write programs to do little things 
 I'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special 
 And also I'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like
 Uh-huh
 that's a key thing 
 Well actually that's a 
 there's really two issues to that that there's so many software packages available today That just require no programming 
 So that yo- 
 in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming 
 but if they were careful they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works
 But I think you you really hit the nail on the head 
 For the average person is exactly what he can use it for 
 And if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters 
 or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the <> nuts and bolts in your garage 
 whatever 
 there your issue is then there really 
 I see 
 well 
 I see 
 well congratulations on that
 Yeah 
 well actually one other thing I might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap
 Uh-huh
 Right 
 the calculators you mean
 Yeah 
 they sure do 
 Yeah 
 I actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum 
 You can actually buy a whole brand new computer with a not not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars
 No
 Well actually I wasn't including a printer 
 but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars 
 so make it seven hundred
 Yeah
 Yes 
 uh-huh
 Yeah 
 the prices had plummeted 
 you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply the box and the mother board of a type of computer called an eighty eighty-eight for about two hundred dollars
 And then the keyboard is another fifty 
 the monitor with the card that drives is another hundred 
 and then the disk drive is two fifty
 Well that's that's the deal is you're not buying brands now 
 you're buying these knock offs 
 so there's 
 probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there's a magazine called COMPUTER SHOPPER
 It's a big magazine 
 it's twelve inches acro- narrow the narrow side and seventeen inches the tall side 
 and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages 
 But the book is the magazine is full of these mail order computer mail-order houses 
 and they're all competing with each
 So you just flip through there until you find a eighty eighty-eight computer 
 that that's called it's the original P C 
 So it's 
 we call the T I an I B M P C compatible 
 And you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me
 And you mix and match 
 and then you do it by mail-order 
 But there's no real brands 
 it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards the main computer the circuit board
 They're available in you know the B Daltons that that type of thing
 You'll notice that in that it's it's a it's a although it's a magazine it's large 
 And like I said it's about an inch thick 
 That's right 
 There's great
 yeah 
 Yeah 
 that's great
 Yeah
 I understand 
 that's great 
 that's a good joke
 I did for years 
 and then I was a scientist over in central research labs 
 and just recently I've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing
 now I I type that one 
 but I don't use it anymore
 Uh-huh 
 Yes
 Uh-huh
 Yes 
 I agree
 yeah
 I see 
 that's fascinating
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Right
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 they certainly are 
 So let's see see 
 so I guess with respect to the question 
 yeah 
 I guess we've kind of covered it
 Great 
 nice little conversation with you Jack
 Good day 
 Thank you 
 Same to you
