 Okay
 I watch evenings because I work all day 
 I used to watch daytimes
 <> mainly like ALL MY CHILDREN that kind of thing
 And then sometimes OPRAH and sometimes DONAHUE 
 but now it's mainly evenings
 Yes
 I tape THIRTY SOMETHING and L A LAW 
 Those are the two I like the best
 I know 
 It's going to be history I know 
 Uh-huh
 well Well 
 Uh-huh
 I know 
 I'm amazed
 Huh-uh 
 I'm surprised that I was surprised at the ending of you know with all the funny things happening and different things
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I know
 I know 
 Isn't that funny
 I don't usually like stuff that continues 
 That's why I'm surprised I like those two shows because usually I like you know stuff that just ends sort of that you just you don't have to have watched you know
 Yeah 
 you don't have to 
 Yeah 
 You don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow 
 so you know I usually don't like that
 Uh-huh
 I know
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Huh-uh
 Uh-huh
 And what night is it on
 great
 Oh
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 he doesn't
 Uh-huh
 So he didn't go howl
 how funny
 
 It's just a half hour 
 or is it hour
 Oh
 There's not many half hour shows 
 it seems like that
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 no 
 I watch those if I 
 see I like sports
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 I know
 No 
 I don't sit
 I know 
 Who has time 
 I don't have time to sit I know
 That's why I don't get to watch that much 
 I watch nine o'clock 
 I do okay because the kids are all in bed 
 but before that I really there's not much time
 Or like at six thirty I'll watch WHEEL OF FORTUNE or something like that
 Uh-huh 
 No 
 I like that 
 No 
 I'll watch game show kind of stuff 
 but Yeah
 Did you send one
 How funny
