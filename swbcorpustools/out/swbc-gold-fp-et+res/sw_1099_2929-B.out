 Well I believe that the the voice that initialized this call asked about if we thought that it should be something that should be put into action
 Yes 
 I I I I would be committed to that becau- 
 definitely 
 Yes
 I know that there are many countries that are very successful with the operation of the government providing that plan
 I'm not sure wha- how their program is run 
 but I know it has been successful
 And I would really have to read the history of probably I the country that has fared very well with it 
 and I'd like to see the the data on that
 Well I 
 Yes 
 I think that's primary is if you have a good relationship with your doctor that you can feel free to discuss anything with him And absolutely that the choice would be yours yes if you felt that you weren't being given the proper guidelines for your health that you should be able to make a choice there
 Yes 
 and the expense of that yes
 Well I would I would think that they would have that as part part of the benefit to the health care program that you would indeed have a choice that you could select that individual yourself 
 And I'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor and hopefully that they would have their accreditations there too
 Yes 
 but those guidelines have to be set up 
 and I think they should be voted on by the public
 And 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Right 
 yes
 And of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be 
 and I think that's primary for the health if they were going to have a universal health care plan That they would have all the facts and the figures and what it would mean to each individual family or an id- individual perhaps being single
 I'm not sure what else that we could address on health care other than the fact I think the eyes and the ears and the whole self should be included in all of that
 dental eye care and our body as a whole should be included in that because there are so many avenues that needs to be undertaken in a program like that 
 I wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for anything and not be covered by the program
 Uh-huh
 And does he have an option if he doesn't care for the personality
 I see 
 Well if he's pleased with it I guess that's the bottom line
 So but I I would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something
 Yeah 
 cause there's always that opposite story there
 Uh-huh
 It's quite different from when I was under doctor's care that's for sure
 I'm I'm very thankful that I'm not under any doctor's care 
 That's right 
 Yes
 Uh-huh 
 what part of Pennsylvania do you live in
 Well I have a brother that lives there 
 near Philadelphia
 Okay
 Are you a native Pennsylvanian
 Okay 
 so I'm a former Michiganian 
 so 
 Yes it is 
 it's very lovely 
 it's a very lovely state
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 I'm sure it is 
 uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 That has broadened so much also
 That is the fields that you know are opening up are just phenomenal
 They 
 look at the AIDS case you know they that's a whole new field in itself 
 It's just it's an auto immune deficiency
 but it sure is a dilly one
 Yes 
 I do too
 To eradicate it entirely yeah
 Well there's guidelines that people have to follow 
 and if they're determined to have their cigarettes and the other carcinogenic causing items then how do you teach them 
 I guess you 
 That's true too
 It's 
 I I I really believe our environment have a lot to do with it
 Yeah
 Well you just have to ban the smoking to their to their little room that they want to 
 Uh-huh 
 uh-huh
 Well it's a bad habit that's tha- 
 Yes 
 It's 
 they say that it is 
 Well it was nice talking with you
 And well you do the same 
 And we'll be t- I guess talking around the country
 Okay 
 you 
 bye-bye
