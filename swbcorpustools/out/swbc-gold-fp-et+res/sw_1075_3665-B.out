 Right
 I li- I have a few you know favorite shows that I try not to miss
 L A LAW is one of them
 Although this year's it's a little easier to miss than last year With the new cast and everything
 Right 
 and I like ROSIE O'NEILL
 THE TRIALS OF ROSIE O'NEILL with Sharon Gless
 She 
 It's very good 
 It it's probably very much a woman's mo- show
 But and then there's a new sitcom on that is Tim Allen's what is it HANDYMAN 
 That's not what 
 HOME IMPROVEMENT
 It's hysterical isn't it
 Did you catch the Christmas 
 I thought it was you know 
 and it had such a good story too
 Did you see the end of it
 Well you know the little boy the little one was trying to decide if there was a Santa Claus
 They thought it was the neighbor 
 He gave the two doubting Thomases a rubber band and a paper clip
 I thought that was wonderful
 And on Sunday used to be on Sunday nights now I can't figure out where they've moved it 
 On our public television they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show
 And it showed the latest developments from all the computer companies
 Well you know it's 
 unless you're really into computers you w- and software you probably wouldn't be interested 
 but I don't know 
 it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there
 And you know what they they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets you know and then they also the hardware
 So you could see what the new developments were and what to look for 
 and I enjoyed that 
 It was just a thirty minute show with no commercials
 It's public television course doesn't have the commercials during the show 
 so 
 And I like the FRUGAL GOURMET
 Well there's very few that you know my life would stop if I didn't catch
 But now I do 
 before I go to work I tape my soap opera
 Well I watch two 
 but one's a half-hour 
 and one's an hour 
 and and they lead into each other
 And that's the BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and AS THE WORLD TURNS
 And I've watched the AS THE WORLD TURNS since I was a little girl 
 So it's just you know 
 it's it's something I've done for the last probably twenty-five years
 Yes 
 and I don't have anyone else at home 
 so I have freedom to watch whatever I want
 But I like I like every I like the {F uh the information shows 
 and I like the comedies 
 and you know and I I do like good movies 
 I prescribed subscribe to H B O
 So I can get some of the movies
 It is 
 But I don't sleep a whole lot 
 and I you know 
 at two o'clock in the morning there isn't anything on regular T V 
 and And So that's 
 and you don't get good reception without cable 
 and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels 
 so that's primarily why I have it right now
 I I thought when I got my V C R I'd probably drop it you know 
 but that was years
