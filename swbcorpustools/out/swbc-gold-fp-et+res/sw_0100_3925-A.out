 Okay 
 I think the first thing they said 
 I have written this down 
 so it would 
 is it p- do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government
 Yeah 
 Right 
 That's a good point
 That's an int- you know that's interesting 
 I had read something one time 
 and it was just applying to governments in general 
 it was written many years ago 
 It said that it's impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers 
 And I thought that was interesting 
 It wasn't just talking about our government 
 It was just government in general From times past you know on 
 and 
 Right 
 And that would be a next question to ask 
 How many do you think are in there for pub- for bu- 
 *[[ I think utt's 3 and 4 should be a single slash unit ]] because they want to be a service to us 
 or are they in there for their own gains 
 and personally I feel it's probably there's probably some of each
 Uh-huh 
 Yeah 
 <> Yeah
 yeah
 And they talked 
 the other let's see 
 Third question was how m- serving for their own gains do you think goes on 
 then they 
 that's hard to answ- 
 I'm sure there's a lot But I agree with you there's a lot in business 
 I think that's just I think that's very normal that we should not ex- I think 
 I think we put too much on politicians 
 We expect them to only be there to serve us you know
 Yeah 
 That's a problem isn't it
 It's interesting 
 because I'm taking a Texas government class right now 
 and one of the things 
 it's so easy to blame them to 
 a lot of times I think it's our own fault 
 They lie to us because we don't want to hear the truth
 And it 
 If they tell us the truth we don't elect them and Especially with all this fron- co- stuff coming up here lately about people's past 
 and I don't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore
 Because it's I think it's gotten just care- well 
 we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life 
 and and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at 
 Right 
 You know I also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out 
 I don't think there would be too many left 
 Uh-huh
 at it's T C J C 
 Tex- Tarrant County Junior College 
 Yeah 
 And it's really it's really enjoyable 
 I like it 
 And then they also you know ask can we eliminate do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption 
 and I don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally
 Yeah 
 but that doesn't mean 
 I don't think making laws will stop it 
 I don't know how many laws you would have to have 
 
 No 
 sure didn't did it
 So no 
 I think you can legislate 
 but I think there's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating 
 and we would end up with so many more laws that you know 
 I just think that's human nature that you're going to have corruption in government in business personal life you know
 Right
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I still believe I get very fed up with government sometimes 
 but when I think about where I'd want to go you know this is still the best 
 or I can 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 at it's worst I think we've got the best
