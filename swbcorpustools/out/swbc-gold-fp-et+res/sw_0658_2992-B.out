 Uh-huh
 yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 we really enjoy that too
 I don't get a lot to watch a whole lot of T V 
 We have a couple of young children 
 and so we're usually outside 
 and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows that if we get them in bed we usually watch that 
 and L A LAW is one of my favorites
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Well we have on SESAME STREET and MISTER ROGERS that kind of stuff 
 and I think those programs are really good for children 
 I know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there
 It's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing you know not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff
 and they usually show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world 
 So 
 My so- older son he's going to be five 
 and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 yeah
 Oh
 Well yeah 
 and you know they especially boys they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff
 and I don't think that they really realize that death is forever you know
 And showing them something like that really doesn't teach them that it is
 No 
 and to get them to feel like that that's just pretend I think is the hardest part you know
 Yeah
 Uh- 
 I was just going to say I know that at least before our kids were born we used to always enjoy watching the COSBY SHOW 
 Thursday nights usually had pretty good with that and as far as very good comedy
 I like to watch DESIGNING WOMEN if the kids are in bed by then
 We're we're in Dallas
 Yes
 Well I did watch it just to see what it was
 and it wasn't really that great 
 So 
 I think after a while they just kind of you know there's no new stuff they can do 
 they've done everything dirty in the book you know 
 so 
 Well no 
 I imagine 
 Everything you could think of you know had a hard time 
 and I think maybe with DALLAS as far as they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first
 Where 
 I don't know 
 I never watched KNOTS LANDING 
 but I think they've had a lot of their characters stay around
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 Oh
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 Where you can lock up the channel or whatever
 Yeah
 Yeah
 And I don't know the way the generations are growing up now 
 I just think they watch so much more T V 
 I try to limit what they watch 
 They aren't sitting in the house watching T V all day because I think it's good for them to have physical activity and that kind of stuff too
 And especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings 
 It's the only cool time to be outside 
 Well true
 Well it was nice talking to you too
 Okay 
 Good-bye
