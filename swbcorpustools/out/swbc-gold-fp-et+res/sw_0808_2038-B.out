 Okay I guess we're on
 Central America have you ever lived in Central America
 Do you do you think that that we should have given up the Panama Canal
 Well there are those that that that think that that that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic importance particularly for the military
 Interestingly enough my father was who was in World War One and as as a civil engineer they they they offered him a commission as a captain if he would go in and and help with the defenses of the Panama Canal
 He had worked for United Fruit Company there
 and they they in fact they had 
 this was in the the late twenties 
 and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over 
 and he turned them down 
 It it's interesting that that most people don't realize how small the canal is 
 Have you ever been there
 It's it's really 
 I I haven't been there 
 I've been to been to Salvador 
 and and in fact we went back to visit some friends of of my fathers that we went in fifty-seven I guess 
 And interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite quite easily 
 The thing I find interesting though is that is the whole colonial approach 
 and and and do we do we support the Sandinistas or or do we support 
 you know when they thought they thought that Nicaragua if you gave them a free election they would vote for the 
 Will you 
 did you ever studied the the political makeup there in in in Nicaragua
 Well the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic 
 I don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama Canal 
 but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua 
 and there were there's a big there's a big lake
 and from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua
 but the the United States had some 
 and I've forgotten what the political influence was 
 but there were economic ties then 
 The issue of of 
 if if it's in the economic interest of the United States do we go in and and prevail 
 and and in other words do we make the world safe for democracy
 but if there's no economic benefit 
 and I think particularly if you're if you're looking at the at the at the peasant whether he's in Central America regardless of where he is is his life is his life better off under communism or or or Democratic government 
 You look at Salvador where the 
 Yeah 
 and and the question is does the government make a difference 
 If they'll mostly leave him alone 
 and I think that's the difficulty they that that we have that it it reality doesn't make doesn't make any difference if he has no income 
 And apparently even some of our alleged Central American leaders that are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things 
 so it's 
 It is it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation 
 and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting them 
 and and Americans have have a pretty good reputation of exploiting 
 you know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and and took it
 and we stole it fair and square 
 I think is Well what's going to be interesting is to the see what the economic impact of of of the the region you know at the moment it the tremendous drug traffic through there
 but the idea of of 
 what's the what's America's role there 
 and it it 
 with with other things going on it it seems to have lessened 
 but you've still got Cuba that accepts exerts some influence
 Well when you take a a situation where I think in particular in Salvador where there is a significant under class 
 and that 
 you know having a a lot of difficulty surviving the question is would they you know would they be better off under communism
 and I wouldn't don't know that I would advocate communism 
 but the question is can can you can can a democracy afford the 
 it's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the U S is that that's essentially an underclass 
 and when you get enough of them you know communism would feed them all
 Well that 
 yeah 
 if the guys got some incentive 
 if he's got 
 you know if he if he can raise enough coffee and bananas to where he's got something to protect 
 other you know 
 whether he can export or at least set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest
 Yeah 
 as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments
 Yes 
 but the but the question is you know if somebody offered you you know a thousand dollars a day to to grow something in your backyard would you do it
 Well not that we could be bought 
 but 
 Well of course everything we're saying is being recorded 
 and 
 Of course 
 of course
 Particularly if you're hungry
 starving to death is not a not a whole lot of fun either 
 and that 
 and and you know when somebody comes in an offers I think that's one of the real problems particularly when when the religious organizations you know the Catholic church has been accused of a lot of things
 In reality I think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves 
 not that they 
 I'm I'm not sure the Catholic church is is is particularly political 
 but you know if
