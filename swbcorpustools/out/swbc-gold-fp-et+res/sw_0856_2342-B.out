 So what do you think about our involvement in the Middle East
 Yeah 
 Well yeah 
 that's probably true 
 I I suspect that if any world war is coming at this point in time they're going to come from there I would think anyway 
 Just seems to be that that's the most unstable part of the world as far as I can tell
 Really
 That would be interesting because I am actually I'm I'm I'm Jewish 
 and I'm actually sort of not not not really a Zionist per se you know
 But I have a I have a lot of friends you know who are sort of adamant you know Israel 
 it's his right 
 and do whatever they want 
 And I think they've been sort of hard nosed about the entire thing 
 And you know in some sense m- the moderates may be right 
 They may you know may be better if they give up just a little bit to settle things down
 Right 
 then then then then is it worth it at all
 I could the way 
 the only way to think about it is Well they won you know 
 they sort of took over the 
 they're one of the only countries in history that has been told that they have to give back what they took in a war which they didn't start basically 
 so 
 So I don't I don't know how to I don't I don't know what to do about it 
 But I think that that you know in general the region is really in bad shape 
 probably 
 isn't isn't there a plan now to make a command center there or something
 I just heard something about moving recently about moving 
 there there there's some central command post in Tampa <> I think that they now want to move to somewhere in the Middle East 
 Actually there was a small country or small city I think or even not actually in Saudi Arabia or anything but a little bit off to the east of it I think 
 And I 
 they want to keep something over there so that they don't have to 
 I guess it's I guess it's sort of so they don't have to move troops out so quickly or something 
 I'm not quite sure exactly why they want to do it 
 But they want to keep some sort of central command post there
 That's true
 Yeah 
 that's 
 they claim that's why we're still there 
 you know why only 
 you note it's only only a small number of people have actually come back yet
 But I think that's actually the scariest part because when in the way what what's happening in Iraq right now you know in itself it being so crazy there 
 I have no idea 
 what do you know 
 just to imagine that one day they're just going to turn around and someone is going to say We don't like you and start attacking again 
 and it's going to be worse 
 I don't know 
 No 
 I don't 
 I ha- I I I have some friends in Israel 
 and coincidently actually my wife is Syrian 
 Yeah 
 so I am 
 we are sort of we are the Middle East peace talks at home 
 And <> I'm just sort of putting away some things from dinner now in the background 
 But we we 
 she has sort of friends and family in Saudi Arabia who are some friends in Saudi Arabia 
 And I have some friends in Israel 
 And we we talk a bit about it 
 but we try and keep it out of the home life
 <> No 
 she was she is actually 
 I think it's for her not really relevant because she is second generation American actually
 Her parents who were born here would like to go see it though I think 
 They would like to go to Syria 
 but they recognize that Syria's not the place that one wants to visit right about now
 You know something about the place makes it not not quite enjoyable
 Yeah 
 I I've actually been there
 I was there a couple of years ago when it wasn't you know sort of dangerous to be out there I guess
 And I do I d- do like it actually 
 I would never live there 
 I think I'm too Americanized and sort of have too much you know too much invested in sort of the easy life
 But I do like the food If that so if that if that amounts for anything
 Yeah 
 actually my house is Kosher 
 but it turns out that one of the strangest things about about Israel is that no- most folks don't realize that for all the food people think of as sort of you know Jewish food and so forth 
 and you know in general it really isn't the food that is eaten in Israel 
 So you typically think of it like bagels 
 right you know 
 bagels and lox
 Turns out you don't you don't you don't really find bagels in Israel 
 What you find is sort of Middle Eastern foods 
 The same foods that you find in Syria and Egypt and everything else 
 <> Have you ever had those
 knishes 
 no 
 you don't you don't see a lot of 
 that's basically Eastern European Jewish food
 It's it's very different 
 I was actually very amazed when I sort of figured out for myself That everything I grew up with really wasn't Israeli 
 It was more Jewish you know
 It it it is very strange
 That that starts tomorrow night
 That's what I'm making 
 that's what I'm doing now 
 I'm making dinner
 Bought up all the bread from 
 That's good 
 Well you've you've you've really got a handle on this stuff I've noticed
 Got the vocabulary down and everything
 That that that makes you real good 
 Yeah 
 we we actually we have the reverse situation 
 Turned out that most of my friends aren't Jewish 
 and and my wife's not
 But I I sort of you know do a lot of these things 
 so so that 
 Seder our first Seder is tomorrow night 
 And this is a rare exception 
 There are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night which 
 and five of them will be Jewish
 Two two years ago we had a Seder 
 we had sixteen people each night 
 Sixteen is the magic number for us
 And I was the only Jew both nights
 So which to me is wonderful because it means that people who never would get to see this so get to see it 
 And my view is Passover is should sort of be 
 in in in in my mind Passover is sort of a generic holiday anyway because it it sort of predates Christ
 So 
 Yeah 
 I caught the end of that
 Yeah 
 every year I try and catch that 
 But yeah 
 That's what always amazes me actually is that is that you know 
 my wife and I always sort of bring this up about sh- her being Syrian you know and my being Jewish you know 
 We look alike 
 we act alike 
 we sound alike 
 well not totally alike 
 but you know it's amazing to think that people in the Middle East sort of all hate each other
 Right
 Right 
 That's that's actually the part that that that I find really strange 
 I I I sort of understand somewhat 
 I I 
 knowing the history I understand that the hatred of the Muslims for you know the Israelis or whatever 
 and I can sort of handle that 
 and but I sort of think about the Muslims sort of running around have jihad against themselves
 You know and and that seems really weird
 Right 
 exactly
 Same same thing
 I don't 
 I'll I'll never understand it 
 My view is look what did you ever do to me
 Didn't hurt me at at at the moment 
 So and and and I I don't know 
 There's a there's something about 
 there's a poem somewhere 
 I don't know if you've ever seen it or not 
 but Everything I Ever Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten
 In this 
 and it talks about how you know if we could just all get toge- you know 
 when we were young everything was great because we all went to class together 
 and in the mi- you know 
 we all had snack time together 
 and then we all took naps 
 and we all held hands and hugged you know 
 and and and that's what kindergarten was like 
 and wouldn't it be nice if if we could solve all our problems by just sort of getting together and everyone in the world sat down and took a nap together
 Woke up and had snack time you know and then hugged each other as we left
 Yeah 
 I wonder if he secretly did that
