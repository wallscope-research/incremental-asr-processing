 Sure 
 We pay far too much in taxes 
 Well far too much for what we get 
 it's just I don't know it ju- just seems too much of the money is just lost 
 
 You mean like those you know twenty thousand dollar toilets 
 Sure 
 it's real easy to spend other people's money 
 Right
 Right 
 E- I don't mind them getting what they need 
 It's just when they pay so much for it
 It takes you know very little to just shop around and 
 That's true 
 Yep
 Right
 Yeah
 I'm also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering like the world's probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 I know 
 I know 
 I don't even You know I don't even get to see half my paycheck
 Between Four Oh One K and and the thirty-four percent they're taking out for taxes
 Let alone what I end up having to pay 
 Sure 
 Nope 
 they won't be able to pay
 Sure 
 none 
 I don't 
 in the first place you know there's also like taxation without representation 
 Well I don't feel represented anymore in our government 
 it it's certainly not a government for me 
 It doesn't take care of my needs 
 an- and people don't care anymore either
 People don't want to go out to vote 
 Yep
 No 
 but but that that's going to backfire because little people who buy everything 
 so 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I wonder though 
 Yeah 
 I'm not 
 I don't know 
 I can't think of any easy answers to it 
 but something has to happen 
 I'm certainly fed up with it
