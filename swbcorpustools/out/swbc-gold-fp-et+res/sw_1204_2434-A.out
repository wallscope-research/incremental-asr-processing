 Well I don't know 
 I've I've had mixed emotions I guess when I listen to the radio and and watch T V about the different things that are happening 
 I'm against it 
 but on the same token I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to do that 
 So I I have a rifle in the house 
 the ammunition is probably so old I'm afraid to use it 
 But I bought it for target practicing and and also because I wanted a weapon 
 how do you feel about it
 
 Uh-huh
 Uh-huh
 Well up up in New England where I'm from you had to get a permit before you could buy any amu- am- ammunition 
 And I thought that was really good 
 And I think if they 
 takes two weeks for that system to process your request for not as a gun permit but but to buy ammunition 
 You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that
 Yeah 
 I I I agree 
 I think you know one of the things that that that needs to happen is to to stop the impulse buyer from buying it quickly and and maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it 
 But if someone's really determined to to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place 
 And you can get them really cheap
 Uh-huh
 How long was the waiting period out there
 
 That wasn't too too bad
 Because if if you're going to go buy something of that nature I think you you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it 
 You're not going to react that quickly 
 In other words you know you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day
 Yeah 
 I do too because it doesn't make any difference whether it's a pistol or a shotgun I suppose 
 They both do the same kind of job 
 yeah 
 I suppose 
 I never got shot with either one 
 But I don't know 
 I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun 
 Yeah 
 Uh-huh
 Oh
 I've got a manual single shot 
 and I guess it doesn't have any any automatic features to it 
 The further away I get the the wider the shot gets from the target 
 And the closer that I get the tighter that it gets 
 It's got a hell of a kick to it
 Do you belong to a gun club or you 
 Uh-huh
 No kidding 
 Well the the clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive 
 but it's well worth it 
 You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have competition 
 I've never really joined a club because I haven't got the time Not because I haven't got the desire 
 there's an annual membership fee that's that's fairly high 
 Plus there's ini- an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time member
 So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club 
 Plus you have to pay for the the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in
 Uh-huh
 I think that that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose 
 In fact I'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon 
 And you know it it 
 even after you wait your nine days if you don't know how to handle it it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive 
 And you give him a license because he waited nine days
 He could he could not only shoot himself 
 He could he could mishandle a weapon Leave it at home and let a child get at it
 Wow 
 He was fortunate 
 He could he could of hit something else 
 Wow
 About private citizens selling a weapons 
 Like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me 
 How do you feel about that 
 Do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the buyer and the seller 
 And or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system because you own it
 Yeah 
 I- isn't there a way to to deregister yourself after you register a gun
 Because I have 
 Yeah 
 Is it registered
 The the rifle that I've got is not registered
 and I don't know why I never registered it 
 but the 
 I I think it's it's voluntary 
 The the 
 Yeah
 Yeah 
 I guess that could happen 
 It's just like the the social security system 
 Once they they gave everybody a number 
 and now they're making you get one at at birth
 And once they have your number they have your identification 
 And if you try to do anything like not identify yourself to the government they know who you are
 And that's true 
 That's all right 
 You you were talking about Fed- what the Federal government knows about people
 They probably do 
 Yeah
 Uh-huh
 Do you find it difficult picking up guns that that are not registered
 No 
 I don't either 
 I can I can buy some today if I wanted to 
 Just you know put up the money
 Uh-huh
 Yeah
 And there's there's no waiting period on that
 To sell the refrigerator
 Yeah
 And I think the Federal government is is really far away from control 
 I I don't believe in 
 I'm s- I shouldn't probably say control 
 I mean regulation 
 Control is something that I wouldn't want the Federal government to have 
 but I would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons
 Yeah
 Unfortunately we we vote for the the people who spend the money
 so I can't complain too much
