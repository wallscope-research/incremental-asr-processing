 Hello
 Hello 
 this is Lois
 And I called you know from that the the T I Data Base Calling Instructions
 Yeah 
 this is about changes in the women in the 
 there's really a lot isn't there
 I think there really is
 I guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it
 Okay 
 All right
 Are you ready now
 Okay 
 like I said I guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations
 no 
 I think no- now you go to work when they're six weeks old you know 
 and you stay there 
 And I feel like the next generation you'll probably just work right along with your husband you know
 I do to much 
 And it's just going to get better
 It really is
 I can't either not a one
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 even in Washington you know there seems to be a lot more women involved
 Yeah 
 yeah
 I do too 
 just your qualifications 
 and that would be it
 Yeah 
 I kind of think maybe in time that you know you'll go by social security numbers you know
 and that way they can't say well they picked a male over a female female over a male you know
 Yeah 
 yeah
 I do to 
 just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that you know that you have
 And then if you get it you know then 
 Uh-huh
 yeah
 As a matter of fact that's what I'm doing
 Uh-huh 
 it sure is
 It sure is
 Oh
 Yeah 
 yeah 
 that is
 Uh-huh
 I do
 I really do 
 I think it's great
 well like one week she'll work three days and I'll work two 
 and the next week you know I'll work three 
 *[[Why are utterances 2 & 3 split up when they are parallel in structure to the single utterance 1 ]] and she'll work two
 and we just share off like that
 Uh-huh 
 yeah 
 we get the full benefits
 But we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under
 Yeah
 It really is 
 and that way we're not really missing any thing out you know of children 
 uh-huh
 it is 
 it is 
 well both of ours is school age 
 but we don't want to miss any of those P T As and you know all of that
 Uh-huh 
 I think it's great 
 I really 
 and I look for more of that in the next generation
 Yes 
 I do too
 Most of the time now you know it's just the weekend 
 or just forget it
 Uh-huh
 To do 
 yeah
 Uh-huh 
 Well I think we've really come a long way in that because 
 Uh-huh
 Yeah 
 but I can rem- remember back growing up my mother 
 it was 
 she always worked 
 but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off
 yeah
 I do too
 Yes 
 yes
 They really are
 I know 
 I know the feeling
 Okay 
 I sure will 
 Bye-bye
